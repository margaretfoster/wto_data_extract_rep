The representative of Kenya said that, while his delegation took note of the intervention by the representative of the United States, his delegation believed that the WTO Secretariat should not be restricted from searching for information.

The representative of the United States said that her delegation was prepared to join a consensus on the preparation of an inventory of documents and reports on the topic of trends in commodity prices. However, her delegation believed that that literature review should be a balanced compilation of materials that focused on trade-related aspects of commodity trends. The Secretariat should be instructed to gather objective analysis from research institutions not directly affiliated with Member Governments and the focus of the literature should be consistent with the trade-liberalizing aspect of the WTO mission.","WTCOMTDM46.pdf","United, States, Secretariat, Member, WTO"
"4997",4997,"121","121.     The Chairman said that there seemed to be consensus about the importance of the issue. However, there were still differences of opinion regarding the approach to be taken to remedy the situation, particularly regarding the proposal to convene a one day special forum to discuss the issue as well as its transmission to other WTO bodies. He suggested that the Committee take note of the                                                                                     WT/COMTD/M/46                                                                                            Page 39 statements made and requested the Secretariat to draw up an inventory of documents on the issue and work already done by other international organizations in other to assist Members' consideration of the issue. He further suggested that the Secretariat prepare that document for the next meeting of the Committee and that the item be kept on the agenda. He would, in the meantime, undertake informal consultations on how to proceed.","WTCOMTDM46.pdf","Chairman, WTO, Committee, Secretariat, Members, Secretariat, Committee"
"4996",4996,"120","120.     The representative of Indonesia said that his delegation supported the proposals made by the delegations of Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda as well as the suggestion of having the issue discussed at a special forum. The reason why his delegation supported consideration of the issue of declining commodity prices in developing countries was what the authors had mentioned in paragraph 3 of their paper. He agreed with the observations made by other international organisations that some developing countries who were heavily dependent on primary commodities were becoming poorer and poorer and had become characterised as ""heavily indebted poor countries"" (HIPCs). The reasons behind the decline in the prices of primary commodities had been explained in the paper. If the CTD, or other WTO bodies, focused a discussion on the issue, Members would be able to find solutions to the problem of falling commodity prices. Developing countries should not have to depend exclusively on international loans. That would make even more countries heavily indebted. He said that he agreed with the observations that had been made by other Members that the declining prices of primary commodities should be seriously considered at the next meeting of the CTD. Developing countries would no longer depend on international loans if that problem could be resolved.","WTCOMTDM46.pdf","Indonesia, Kenya, Tanzania, Uganda, CTD, WTO, Members, Members, CTD"
"4995",4995,"12","12.      The representative of Japan said that at the Committee on Budget, Finance and Administration (Committee on BFA), it had been stated that his delegation would urge the CTD to examine and evaluate the TA activities that had been implemented before embarking on discussions regarding the 2004 TA Plan. His delegation sought clarification as to whether the TA activities planned for the remaining part of 2003 would be fully implemented according to schedule. He was reiterating those points to make Members aware of them. To avoid any misunderstanding, he would explain that in more detail. The intention was to caution against the hasty implementation of TA activities. Since there were only three months remaining in 2003, more attention needed to be paid to the expenditure on the TA activities and that did not mean just adding the numbers of implemented activities. Thus, at the Committee on BFA, his delegation had indicated its reservation on any hasty WT/COMTD/M/46 Page 4 implementation of TA activities. He expressed his delegation's appreciation to the Secretariat in preparing the first draft of the 2004 TA Plan which incorporated the comments and inputs made by both donor and beneficiary Members during its preparation process, and provided a good basis towards finalizing the 2004 TA Plan. He stressed the importance of reviewing the implemented plans while embarking on discussions on the draft 2004 TA Plan and on the projected total amount of expenditure. While his delegation appreciated the Secretariat's report on the implementation of the 2003 TA Plan as well as the Director-General's report on paragraph 41 of Doha Ministerial Declaration (WT/MIN(3)/3) submitted at the Fifth Ministerial Meeting at Cancún, it believed that a more qualitative analysis of the implemented plan was useful to embark on that exercise. In other words, his delegation would appreciate an elaboration on both the positive and negative points experienced in the delivery of the TA activities. Upon receipt of such detailed information, which should provide examples of an efficient and effective implementation of the trade-related technical assistance (TRTA) as well as areas where there was room for improvement, it would be useful to share the experiences and make use of the lessons learned before enabling any justification for the 2004 TA Plan. That feedback exercise would contribute to a more efficient and effective use of human and financial resources.","WTCOMTDM46.pdf","Japan, Committee, on, Budget, ,, Finance, and, Administration, -LRB-, Committee, BFA, CTD, Members, Committee, BFA, Secretariat, Members, Secretariat, Director-General, Cancún"
"4994",4994,"119","119.    The representative of Benin said that his delegation associated itself with the intervention made by the representative of Kenya. The question of declining commodity prices was crucial for developing countries and for African countries in particular as most of those countries were producers and net exporters of one or more commodities. The evolution of the world economy and Africa's share in world trade showed that urgent action had to be taken. The proposals contained in the paper by the delegations of Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda were wise, reflected the realities in the field and merited careful consideration for appropriate and sustainable solutions to be found.","WTCOMTDM46.pdf","Benin, Kenya, Africa, Kenya, Tanzania, Uganda"
"4993",4993,"118","118.     The representative of Rwanda said that his delegation supported the suggestions made by the representative of Kenya on the issue of commodities which was vital to developing country economies. The representative of Kenya had listed some commodities for which their prices had tragically declined. He mentioned the case of coffee which was important to producers in Rwanda. More than half of the export earnings of the Rwandan economy depended on the export of coffee. Coffee prices had declined and continued to do so. The question had been raised during the 50th Session of the Trade and Development Board of UNCTAD and it would soon be discussed by the United Nations in New York. As the representative of Switzerland had mentioned, the WTO could not ignore that important issue. He said that the proposals made by the representative of Kenya were plausible and warranted discussion. It was therefore important that there was a forum within the WTO to discuss the question. Members could then take decisions on how to treat the issue.","WTCOMTDM46.pdf","Rwanda, Kenya, Kenya, Rwanda, Trade, and, Development, Board, of, UNCTAD, United, Nations, New, York, Switzerland, WTO, Kenya, WTO, Members"
"4992",4992,"117","117.    She continued by saying that concern had been raised that the paper confined itself to a narrow range of commodities to which specific reference had been made. The non-paper dealt with coffee, cocoa and sugar as those were some of the main commodities which African countries WT/COMTD/M/46 Page 38 produced and exported. However, the non-paper dealt in general terms with problems faced in trade in other commodities. Her delegation expected that requests for discussions on other products would be held in due course as the CTD commenced its discussions with interested producing countries. In conclusion, she said that her delegation believed that at that meeting Members should take a decision on the way forward in terms of how the CTD should deal with the issue of commodities Her delegation proposed that, as a starting point, the CTD request the Secretariat to prepare an inventory or bibliography of relevant documents, including a compilation of relevant work carried out by the WTO and other relevant organizations. That work would facilitate a substantial discussion in the CTD to identify long term solutions, as envisaged in the non-paper. It was in that regard that her delegation suggested that the CTD should hold a special forum. Her delegation was not aiming at the creation of a negotiating body but proposed a one day special forum for such discussions. In order to provide sufficient time for the preparation of background documentation, her delegation suggested that the special forum be held after the forthcoming CTD meeting in November 2003, or perhaps early in 2004.","WTCOMTDM46.pdf","CTD, Members, CTD, CTD, Secretariat, WTO, CTD, CTD"
"4991",4991,"116","116.     The representative of Kenya thanked other delegations for their views and comments on the proposal made by her delegation. She said that her delegation wished to respond to and possibly clarify some of the issues and concerns raised. Regarding the legal basis for work in the WTO, and particularly work in the CTD on the stabilization of commodity prices, she said that, as was pointed                                                                                     WT/COMTD/M/46                                                                                            Page 37 out in paragraph 33 of her delegation's paper, Article XXXVIII of Part IV of the GATT specifically encouraged Members inter alia to negotiate and adopt international arrangements providing inter alia ""measures to attain stable, equitable and remunerative prices for exports of primary commodities."" That provision further provided that such arrangements provide for collaboration in matters of trade and development with UN bodies such as UNCTAD and other international financial institutions. That was a view that was shared by many Members given the inclusion of the paragraph on commodities in the draft Cancún Ministerial Declaration. That was a paragraph on which there seemed to be consensus. The main responsibility for overseeing the implementation of the provisions of Part IV of the GATT rested with the CTD. The CTD therefore had a clear mandate to discuss and agree on the measures that could be taken at the international level for the stabilization of prices for primary commodities. In undertaking such work the CTD could further request other WTO bodies, including negotiating groups, to examine the issues falling under their respective mandates and report back to the CTD on the progress made and the results achieved in their deliberations. Her delegation agreed that, under ordinary circumstances, it would be desirable for prices to be determined by free market forces. Economic theory however recognized that Governments had a legitimate obligation to intervene where there was market failure. Such market failure could occur when there was imbalance between demand and supply which was responsible for price volatility. Such situations had in the past made it necessary for interested countries to enter into arrangements for supply management by negotiating commodity agreements in which both consuming and producing countries participated, or in the alternative, by negotiating agreements or arrangements in which only producing countries participated. Her delegation agreed that past experience had shown that commodity agreements had not been successful in stabilizing prices of commodities. The economic clauses which authorized international commodity organizations like those of coffee, cocoa and sugar to intervene in the market had been suspended. While there could be many reasons for the failure of those commodity agreements, most importing processing industries in developed countries continued to benefit from the low prices and their governments had not generally been enthusiastic about allowing the buffer stocks in agencies to enter into the market with a view to averting or controlling declines in prices. As the non-paper explained in paragraph 22, the approach of developed countries on that issue appeared to be undergoing a change. It could currently be argued that there was an increasing willingness on the part of developed countries to intervene in the market to control production on a mutually advantageous basis in industrial raw materials which they produced such as steel, aluminium, and some industrial chemicals. Informal agreements to control the production of aluminium appeared to exist at present amongst major aluminium producing countries. With regards to steel, she said that negotiations for the control of production through, inter alia, the acceptance of an enhanced discipline for the use of subsidies with a view to reducing structural oversupply were underway in the OECD. In the developing world, the serious problem posed to trade and development as a result of declining prices had made producing countries give serious consideration to arrangements for supply management among producing countries. The UNCTAD Report of the Meeting of Eminent Persons on Commodity Issues noted the positive results that Malaysia and other rubber producing countries had been able to achieve following the adoption of an agreement for supply management. She said that she briefly wished to comment on the point made relating to the consistency of price stabilization measures which might involve restrictions on imports and exports with the overall objective of the WTO of promoting free trade through the elimination of barriers to trade. In her delegation's view, the objective of the WTO was to promote trade liberalization subject to the condition that it promoted development and assisted poor countries in alleviating poverty in line with the preamble to the Marrakesh Agreement. Measures taken to ensure that farmers producing primary commodities secured prices at remunerative rates in order to improve their living standards was therefore fully consistent with the objectives of the GATT and the WTO. That was specifically recognized in Part IV of the GATT which contained provisions relating to the role of trade in promoting development.","WTCOMTDM46.pdf","Kenya, WTO, CTD, GATT, Members, UN, UNCTAD, Members, Cancún, GATT, CTD, CTD, CTD, WTO, CTD, OECD, Malaysia, WTO, WTO, GATT, WTO, GATT"
"4990",4990,"115","115.    The representative of Cuba reiterated her delegation's support for the proposal made by the representative of Kenya and stressed the relevance of the CTD considering those proposals. Her delegation supported the proposal for a special session dedicated to trade and commodities. That was an issue which had been left outside of the multilateral negotiating agenda and it was an important subject for a large number of Members who had seen a constant decline of their share in world trade over the past years due to their structural dependence and the drop in commodity prices for reasons that were known to all. Her delegation also supported the proposals for an inventory to be prepared by the Secretariat and the referral of the paper by the delegations of Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda to other WTO bodies. She also highlighted the importance of cooperating with other organizations that had already undertaken analysis on commodities such as UNCTAD.","WTCOMTDM46.pdf","Cuba, Kenya, CTD, Members, Secretariat, Kenya, Tanzania, Uganda, WTO, UNCTAD"
"4989",4989,"114","114.    The representative of Japan said that, having acknowledged the concerns of developing countries, in particular the countries dependent on a few export commodities, his delegation wished to continue discussions on the matter. However, his delegation believed that there was still a wide gap between the proponents and the other members on how to proceed with future work on the issue. He said that his delegation therefore expressed its reservation against the establishment of a special session based on the proposals put forward by the representative of Kenya which still contained some controversial points as mentioned by the delegations of the United States, Canada and the European Communities. It would nevertheless be useful to compile documentation related to the matter for Members to get a clearer picture of the situation and consider options for future work. His delegation therefore supported the ideas mentioned by the representative of Kenya to ask the Secretariat to make such a compilation for the further discussion. His delegation considered that such an exercise would be helpful before embarking on a substantial discussion on the proposals contained in the non paper. As suggested by several delegations at the last session of the Committee, it could continue the discussions in an informal setting.","WTCOMTDM46.pdf","Japan, Kenya, United, States, Canada, Members, Kenya, Secretariat, Committee"
"4988",4988,"113","113.    The representative of India said that Members needed to recognise the seriousness of the long-term decline in commodity prices which had been flagged by the representative of Kenya. It also had to be recognized that the subject was a legitimate concern of the WTO, and of the CTD within the WTO. The mandate of the WTO in that regard was explicit in Articles XXXVI and XXXVIII of GATT 1994. In addition, the terms of reference of the CTD left no doubt that what the Committee was considering was well within the ambit of the subjects that the CTD was supposed to deal with. In terms of how progress could be made, his delegation believed that there was a need for more analytical work by the Secretariat. A first step in that direction could be the preparation of an inventory of research papers and other documentation that had been prepared by other international organizations. He said that it would also be useful for the Secretariat to liaise more actively with other organisations such as UNCTAD and FAO which were working on the subject. His delegation also supported the idea of a special session of the CTD, but the timing was a matter that could be discussed depending on the progress the Committee could make and the background material the Secretariat could prepare.","WTCOMTDM46.pdf","India, Members, Kenya, WTO, CTD, WTO, WTO, GATT, CTD, Committee, CTD, Secretariat, Secretariat, UNCTAD, FAO, CTD, Committee, Secretariat"

The representative of Nigeria said that his delegation supported the request made by the representative of Kenya and believed that a background document by the Secretariat could do justice to the topic and bring out some of the salient issues mentioned and some of the reservations made by other delegations. His delegation also supported the idea of convening a special session of the CTD with a view to consider the transmission of the issue to other WTO bodies.","WTCOMTDM46.pdf","Nigeria, Kenya, Secretariat, CTD, WTO"
"4985",4985,"110","110.    The Chairman said that the meeting had been suspended on item E of the Agenda. The delegation of Kenya had then made a number of suggestions to the Committee, for it to review the problems that primary exporting countries encountered and asked the Secretariat to elaborate background documentation, including an inventory of documents and reports prepared by other organizations. The delegation of Kenya had further proposed the organization of a special session of the CTD to consider the questions mentioned in their paper and during which the Committee could decide to transmit the paper to other WTO bodies. In response to the suggestions made by the delegation of Kenya, some Members had expressed their reservation regarding the transmission of the document to other WTO bodies in light of the fact that, among other reasons, the work of those bodies had been suspended. Some members however did express an interest in having the Committee request the Secretariat to draw up an inventory of documents and reports which could be useful for a discussion in the CTD in order to avoid duplication of work undertaken by other organizations.

"4984",4984,"11","11.      The representative of Mauritius said that he was speaking on behalf of his Government, but as coordinator of the African Group wished to point out that the African Group had not yet met to discuss the document. However, he was certain that it would do so and come up with substantive reflections in due course. A large number of the components of the TA Plan catered for the needs of African countries. He would deal with both the report on the implementation of the 2003 TA Plan and the draft 2004 TA Plan together. It was important that the TA Plan continued to be based on the principles and priorities laid down in the strategy for the TA cooperation as enunciated in the Doha Ministerial Declaration. He noted that the Geneva-based trade policy courses would include a trade policy course for French speaking officials. That was important and useful because there were a large number of Francophone African Member countries. In paragraph 19 on page 5 that the Secretariat had planned regional trade policy courses for Anglophone African Member countries to be held in Nairobi, Kenya and that the venue for the course for Francophone African Member countries, was still to be determined. There were other programmes of interest to Africa such as the Joint Integrated Technical Assistance Programme (JITAP) that was well underway and which in the initial stages had been delivered to a number of African countries and which would probably be extended to other African countries. The African Group might wish to express its interest on the round table held in Tanzania, Uganda and Gambia on the Integrated Framework (IF). Among the regional seminars, the Secretariat had continued to focus on the needs of African countries in terms of working towards the needs of the Anglophone and Francophone countries. That was an important component of the 2004 TA Plan. His delegation was pleased to see that the regional seminars would cover the Uruguay Round Agreements and WTO related topics. He said that African countries were interested in the national TA and training activities spelt out in paragraph 36 of page 9 which related mainly to accessions and mainstreaming. Mention was made of assisting Members in the services negotiations an issue which needed emphasis as African countries were well behind in that process.","WTCOMTDM46.pdf","Mauritius, African, Group, African, Group, Member, Secretariat, Member, Nairobi, Kenya, Member, Africa, Joint, Integrated, Technical, Assistance, Programme, African, Group, Tanzania, Uganda, Gambia, Secretariat, Uruguay, WTO, Members"
"4983",4983,"109","109.    The representative of Switzerland said that the problem raised by the delegations of Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda was an essential problem for developing countries and for the world economy. The CTD should not consider the problem of short-term price fluctuations, although it was true that prices for some products had increased in the previous months, but consider the long-term structural problem of declining revenue for developing countries. He said that he did not believe that it made sense to talk about substance and Members' own convictions regarding the solutions before Members had agreed that the problem was important enough for the trading system and developing countries and for the WTO to become a forum for such discussions. His delegation believed that the WTO was such a forum as some of the issues were part of the negotiating agenda. He believed that the CTD could follow the consensus reached in the draft Cancún Ministerial Declaration as that paragraph had not given rise to any problems. Members could therefore assume that there was a consensus for the CTD to continue to consider the issue. When considering how to deal with the issue it was clear that some of the proposals made by the representative of Kenya were too far reaching. The Secretariat should continue its work on the issue and should make an inventory and try to find focus which could be presented to the CTD for discussion. The focus had to be restricted in terms of the types of commodities treated as well as to the types of instruments that the WTO could consider. However, that did not exclude the CTD from discussing instruments which would have to be dealt with elsewhere. The CTD should nevertheless not refer the issue to other WTO bodies which at that time did not have any mandate to continue their work. The issue was part of the DDA and Members should use the time available to take a step forward.                                  Resumed Meeting on 23 October","WTCOMTDM46.pdf","Switzerland, Kenya, Tanzania, Uganda, CTD, Members, Members, WTO, WTO, CTD, Cancún, Members, CTD, Kenya, Secretariat, CTD, WTO, CTD, CTD, WTO, DDA, Members"
"4982",4982,"108","108.     The representative of the European Communities said that his delegation was not in a position to agree to the proposals that had been made by the representative of Kenya. Nevertheless, his delegation nevertheless recognized that there were issues in connection with trade and commodities that might merit further discussion and analysis within the framework of the CTD. His delegation had no objection to pursuing such work in the coming months. However, the CTD had to be clear about the scope and objectives of any discussions it envisaged, as well as how discussions in the WTO, and in the CTD specifically, could provide added value to efforts made by other international organizations, some of which had already been mentioned such as UNCTAD, the World Bank and the IMF. For that reason, the CTD needed to reflect on how to proceed. In doing so, the Committee needed to address questions relating to the focus of the discussions. His delegation joined other delegations in expressing reservations against reintroducing market management instruments which had been attempted in the past and not been successful. It was more a question of competitiveness, diversification and of how to develop downstream industries building on commodity strengths. What         2             Issued as United Nations General Assembly document A/58/401 on 2 October 2003.

Members had to be certain about the focus they wished to give the discussion in the CTD and what contribution they believed the CTD could make. Further clarification was needed to identify which commodities the Committee was to consider. Some commodities had in the past experienced declining terms of trade. That could have had a negative impact on export earnings of particular developing countries. The situation was however not identical in each individual market. Members therefore needed to decide whether they were to consider agricultural or mineral commodities, food-related commodities or non food-related commodities, tropical products or non tropical products or whether the commodities should be considered on a case-by-case basis or at a general level and whether the proponents had in mind something more limited in mind in terms of the scope of the discussion. The outcome of the Cancún Ministerial Conference had not provided Members with any additional political guidance on how to handle the issue in the future. He said that, in his view, that meant that the CTD, at that moment, had to proceed on the basis of its own resources rather than in cooperation with other WTO bodies. The CTD nevertheless had to be conscious about what was being done by other organizations in that field and what would fall within the scope of the WTO negotiating groups on agricultural and industrial products when those were reactivated.","WTCOMTDM46.pdf","European, Communities, Kenya, CTD, WTO, CTD, UNCTAD, World, Bank, IMF, CTD, Committee, United, Nations, General, Assembly, Members, CTD, CTD, Committee, Members, Cancún, Ministerial, Conference, Members, CTD, WTO, CTD, WTO"

The representative of Australia said that her delegation was sympathetic to the message behind the paper submitted by the delegations of Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda on the serious problems that low commodity prices were causing and the implications for development. It was for that reason that her Government continued to be a strong proponent of further international trade reform through the agricultural negotiations of the DDA. There was little doubt that a fairer and market-oriented agricultural trading system would provide significant benefits to all Members, and to developing countries in particular. She noted that the paper mentioned many issues that should be discussed in the agricultural negotiations. Her delegation was therefore prepared to consider the paper in further detail. However, her delegation also shared some of the concerns that had been voiced by the delegation of Canada such as where in the WTO the issue should best be raised and that Members needed to be mindful of what the WTO could and could not do. The suggestion made by the representative of Kenya for an inventory of documents was an important first step that should be considered as a way forward.","WTCOMTDM46.pdf","Australia, Kenya, Tanzania, Uganda, DDA, Members, Canada, WTO, Members, WTO, Kenya"
"4980",4980,"106","106.    The representative of Canada said that her delegation had similar reservations as those expressed by the representative of the United States about the particular approaches proposed in the paper presented by the delegations of Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda. Notwithstanding that, her delegation did believe that it did contain some issues which were worth consideration in the CTD. Her delegation supported the idea of an inventory of documents. That was an important first step as a large number of documents existed on the topic. The Committee should however not decide immediately to hold a special session until it had considered the issue further as well as what was being done elsewhere. A session would be organized at UNCTAD the following day to consider the ""Report of the Meeting of Eminent Persons on Commodity Issues"".2 A large session was planned between UNCTAD and the International Institute for Sustainable Development (IISD) for later in 2003. With respect to the transfer of documents to other WTO bodies she said that her delegation considered it pointless to refer documents to bodies which were not operating at that time.","WTCOMTDM46.pdf","Canada, United, States, Kenya, Tanzania, Uganda, CTD, Committee, UNCTAD, UNCTAD, International, Institute, for, Sustainable, Development, WTO"
"4979",4979,"105","105.     The representative of the United States said that her Government had had an opportunity to carefully review the paper submitted by the delegations of Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda and had strong reservations regarding the direction of the paper. The paper anticipated stabilizing commodity prices through supply management and other actions such as reducing production for example by cutting trees, buying buffer stocks or destroying them, forming international commodity agreements, and banning exports based on quality criteria. Her Government thought that that was going in the wrong direction. As her delegation had stated at the July 2003 meeting of the General Council, it was her delegation's view that prices and the terms of trade for commodities were functions of markets. The WTO was devoted to the ideas of competition and free trade. Her delegation therefore did not see the merit in contemplating arrangements that might restrict competition. Where such arrangements had been tried in the past, they had not been successful. As such agreements had become unworkable, Members had moved on in other directions. The goals of the WTO were to work towards trade liberalization, not trade restriction. Commodity arrangements to restrict production and manage markets were contrary to the goals of the WTO. Her delegation had also noted that the paper focused on a narrow set of commodities. Other Members could rightly argue that the prices of a broad range of agricultural and non-agricultural commodities had, at some point, WT/COMTD/M/46 Page 34 experienced volatility and decline. She asked whether it would be prudent to consider supply- management for any or all commodities or products that had experienced substantial price volatility at one point in time. Commodity prices that were low for a period would often reverse. She noted for instance that cotton prices were at a record high in 2003. Her delegation did not wish to contemplate price stabilization schemes, particularly considering previous efforts at plurilateral agreements such as those in dairy and meat. Her delegation was thus, at that point, unable to agree to the specific proposals that had been put forward by the delegation of Kenya on how to proceed, although her delegation understood and the concerns expressed. Also, there was no ongoing process in the negotiating groups on which to build at that point. It was therefore inappropriate to forward any work to the negotiating groups whose work had been suspended. More fundamentally, her delegation was not convinced that that was a particularly productive way of proceeding.","WTCOMTDM46.pdf","United, States, Kenya, Tanzania, Uganda, General, Council, WTO, Members, WTO, WTO, Members, Kenya"
"4978",4978,"104","104.    The representative of Cuba said that at the last session when the initial proposal had been made by the delegations of Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda, her delegation had not been prepared to make any comment with respect to whether what was proposed could be implemented in the CTD. However, her Government had considered the issue and felt that it merited attention and her delegation therefore supported the proposals made in the third part of the document regarding the need to broaden the WTO's attention to primary commodities. That issue should be dealt with in the CTD.","WTCOMTDM46.pdf","Cuba, Kenya, Tanzania, Uganda, CTD, WTO, CTD"
"4977",4977,"103","103.     She went on to suggest that the Committee decide to transmit the non-paper, which her and other delegations had submitted, for consideration by the following bodies: the Special Session of the Committee on Agriculture when it resumed its work, the Negotiating Group on Market Access when it resumed its work, the Working Group on Trade, Debt and Finance and the Working Group on Trade, Transfer and Technology. Those bodies should be requested to commence an examination of the issues and problems identified in the non-paper, which fell within their respective mandates. She further suggested that the CTD should remain responsible for overseeing that progress was made by those bodies in finalizing concrete solutions during the course of the negotiations to the problems which the primary exporting countries faced as a result of declining commodity prices. The Committee should, towards that end request the other bodies to send continuous reports on their respective discussions for review and assessment.","WTCOMTDM46.pdf","Committee, Committee, on, Agriculture, Negotiating, Group, on, Market, Access, Working, Group, on, Trade, Working, Group, on, Trade, CTD, Committee"
"4976",4976,"102","102.    The representative of Kenya said that she wished to begin by thanking the Chairman, on behalf of her delegation and the delegations of Tanzania and Uganda, for the efforts he had made in pursuance of the request made by them to get a paragraph on commodity issues included in the Cancún Ministerial text. Her delegation considered that the failure of the Cancún Ministerial Conference should not in any way lead to the postponement of the analytical and research-oriented work which the Committee should undertake to ensure that in the current negotiations, solutions were found to the problems that the commodity exporting countries encountered as a result of declining commodity prices. Towards that end, she said that she wished to make the following suggestions for consideration and appropriate decisions at that or future meetings. First, the sponsors of the paper wished to propose that the Committee commence an examination of the problems that primary exporting countries encountered, on the basis of the elements that had been identified in the non- paper. She further proposed that the Secretariat be asked to prepare the background documentation                                                                                    WT/COMTD/M/46                                                                                           Page 33 for that exercise including an inventory of documents and reports that could provide a useful basis for discussion. That would help Members avoid duplicating what had already been done by other organizations. In that context, it was important to note that useful work for addressing those problems was being done not only by the concerned international commodity organizations but also by other organizations like UNCTAD and the World Bank. UNCTAD for instance, had recently arranged for a meeting of eminent experts to examine the problems faced by coffee exporting countries. The World Bank had issued a study entitled ""The State of Sustainable Coffee: A Study of Twelve Major Markets"" which surveyed the demand and consumption trends in eleven European markets and Japan. In addition, it appeared from the recent annual report of the WTO, that the Economic Research and Statistics Division of the Secretariat was engaged, as a part of its ongoing work, in examining some of the issues that had implications for the development of trade in primary commodities. To begin such discussions the CTD could hold a special session during which substantive discussions could be held on the issues identified in the non-paper. However, in order for substantive discussions to take place it would be necessary to ensure that the required background documentation was available to delegations well in advance of the proposed special session of the Committee. She proposed that the representatives of the World Bank, IMF and UNCTAD, and if possible the representatives of international commodity organizations, be invited to that special session.","WTCOMTDM46.pdf","Kenya, Chairman, Tanzania, Uganda, Cancún, Committee, Committee, Secretariat, Members, UNCTAD, World, Bank, UNCTAD, World, Bank, Japan, WTO, Economic, Research, and, Statistics, Division, Secretariat, CTD, Committee, World, Bank, IMF, UNCTAD"
"4975",4975,"101","101.     The Chairman said that said that the item relating to declining terms of trade for primary commodities, and its implication to the trade and development of primary commodity exporting countries had been discussed at the last meeting upon the request by some African primary commodity exporting countries. The delegations of Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda had submitted a paper on the issue contained in document WT/COMTD/W/113. The delegation of Kenya had, when introducing the document, highlighted the declining terms of trade for primary commodities and its effects on the trade and development of primary commodity exporting countries and had suggested that the WTO take action. The Committee had taken note of the document and the statements made and as requested by the Committee the Chairman said that he had held informal consultations on 3 July 2003 after which the delegations of Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda had suggested that the issue of declining terms of trade for primary commodities be included in the Cancún Ministerial Declaration or any document issued from that Conference. They had, in that context, submitted document WT/GC/W/508 of 22 July 2003 to the General Council. During the informal consultations of the CTD, Members had agreed that the Committee revert to the issue at its 46th Regular Session.","WTCOMTDM46.pdf","Chairman, Kenya, Tanzania, Uganda, Kenya, WTO, Committee, Committee, the, Chairman, Kenya, Tanzania, Uganda, Cancún, General, Council, CTD, Members, Committee"
"4974",4974,"100","100.      The Chairman said that, before concluding the item, he wished to draw Members' attention to a letter related to the reporting by the Sub-Committee on LDCs. At the request of the CTD at its 44th Session, the Sub-Committee on LDCs had considered the initiative by the Government of Canada for the LDCs. He said that, following the consideration, the Chairman of the Sub-Committee, Ambassador Molander, had sent a letter which stated that, during its 33rd Session, the Sub-Committee on LDCs had welcomed the initiative taken by the Government of Canada. That letter was available in the room. The Sub-Committee had also appreciated the improvement in the rules-of-origin regulations for textiles and apparel products. The Chairman of the Sub-Committee had indicated that, for further information, the discussion in its entirety was available in the report of the 33rd Session of the Sub-Committee contained in document WT/COMTD/LDC/M/33.","WTCOMTDM46.pdf","Chairman, Members, CTD, LDCs, Canada, LDCs, Chairman, Ambassador, Molander, Canada, Chairman, Sub-Committee"
"4973",4973,"10","10.      The representative of the United States echoed the remarks made by the delegations of the European Communities and Switzerland. She said that the report would be helpful when considering the financial elements of the delivery of the 2003 TA Plan and in terms of what the Secretariat was attempting to deliver for 2004 with the same resources. That gave Members a better sense to where they stood with respect to the overall 2003 TA Plan and its implementation. Members had received an assessment for the first half of the year and she asked when they would receive the report on the third quarter. She asked what the Secretariat's plans were with respect to ensuring that it delivered the remainder of activities that were feasible. She was talking in terms of an assessment of how those activities that had not been delivered as part of the 2002 TA Plan could be delivered or perhaps in finding an alternative way than had been anticipated to meet those needs. There had been a lot of reprogramming due to the SARS crisis and the Iraqi war. She said that it would be helpful for information on further implementation in 2003to be provided orally or where figures were involved it would be useful for delegations to receive that information in writing.","WTCOMTDM46.pdf","United, States, Switzerland, Secretariat, Members, Members, Secretariat"

His delegation was, like other delegations, interested in discussing the issues raised because his delegation was concerned about low commodity prices and their effect on all major agricultural traders. His government was still considering the paper but had some initial concerns which he would not spell out in detail, other than to say that he thought that experiments with institutional arrangements to manage international markets had been tried previously without much success. His delegation was willing to discuss the issue further but remained to be convinced that following that track was the best way to resolve the problems. He said that he joined others who had pointed to the core business of the WTO, as reflected in the agriculture negotiations. Those discussions, which were aimed at improving market access and reducing the excessive domestic support levels that all Members currently faced were key and constituted the equal buy which could contribute to a stabilization and increase in international commodity prices. The focus should therefore be maintained on those issues in the lead up to the Cancún Ministerial Conference.

She shared the view of the delegation of Switzerland, and in fact the authors of the paper, that it was not clear exactly what the appropriate role for the WTO would be with respect to commodities, which other institutions could be involved, and how the problem might be addressed. Like other delegations, her delegation was also aware that ongoing negotiations in the WTO, particularly the market access and agriculture negotiations, were going to be important parts of the solution.

"4951",4951,"91","91.      The representative of Switzerland said that his delegation had not had sufficient time to consult on what to do with the paper submitted by the delegation of Kenya and others. It was clear that falling commodity prices was a fundamental problem for many developing countries. The question was to what extent it was useful to discuss that in addition to the aspects which were already being discussed in the WTO, or whether those additional aspects should be discussed in other institutions. What was being discussed intensely at the WTO was the question of agriculture subsidies, the question of tariff escalation, which was another item in the agricultural negotiations, the future of the Generalized System of Preferences (GSP), and the different initiatives for the LDCs. The difficult question was whether other initiatives which might be necessary, such as those mentioned in the illustrative list of elements given by the proponents, required a new forum and whether the intention was to bring questions such as agreements between produces and other                                                                                    WT/COMTD/M/45                                                                                           Page 27 questions of that type into the WTO. On that issue, he could not give a reply for his Government. It was a question of international governance and his delegation would therefore agree to informal consultations. He said that he did not wish to give the impression that his delegation did not consider the problem of basic commodities as being important. It was one of the key questions for many poor countries at the present time. His Government was concerned about the different policies which had to be put into place to counter falling commodity prices. He was also concerned about where those questions should be discussed and where the decisions should be made.","WTCOMTDM45.pdf","Switzerland, Kenya, WTO, WTO, WTO"

He said that he understood the case and the argument put forward by the co-sponsors of the paper.

"4946",4946,"87","87.      The representative of Cuba said that he thanked the delegations of Kenya, Uganda and Tanzania for their communication on the important issue of primary commodities. It had been recognized that primary commodities were of primordial importance for developing countries. Agricultural products had been characterised by depressed prices for many important export products such as sugar and coffee. No possible solution seemed to emerge as structural imbalances affected those markets. He said that a recent report pointed out that the average prices for almost all commodities had been constantly declining from a maximum reached in the 1980s to the minimum prices of the last two decades. The decline in prices had been even more spectacular for tropical products. The prices for coffee had gone down to the lowest level in the past 30 years. Other agricultural products such as beverages had faced similar situations. Primary products had undergone a significant deterioration. For example, cotton prices had dropped to its lowest level when compared to the mid-1980s. There were 43 countries in Sub-Sahara, in Latin America and in the Caribbean who obtained more that 50 per cent of their agricultural export earnings from one single agricultural commodity. In those countries, there was a direct relationship between the trade of commodities, economic growth and food security. In spite of the priority given in the Doha Ministerial Declaration to the establishment of a legal framework for the progress of developing countries, the agricultural negotiations did not seem to have resolved the main problems of Members largely dependent on agricultural exports. He said that the large problems for developing countries which were related to the production of and trade in those products had not received any answers during those negotiations. High tariffs and tariff escalation made matters worse as they not only limited the problems to market access but also prevented the diversification of developing countries' agricultural production. In that connection, he said that his delegation believed that the document merited special attention in the framework of the ongoing negotiations.","WTCOMTDM45.pdf","Cuba, Kenya, Uganda, Tanzania, Sub-Sahara, Latin, America, Caribbean, Members"
"4945",4945,"86","86.      She turned to the question of how further work in the area should be organized and said that her delegation believed that it was necessary to bear in mind that that meeting of the Committee would be the last one before the Cancún Ministerial Conference. The Members sponsoring the non- paper therefore realized that it would not be possible for the CTD, at that meeting, to have in depth and substantive discussion on the issues raised in the non paper. She therefore suggested that the CTD could arrange a special session to consider the issue outlined in the non-paper. The issue of commodities was an important issue which was directly linked to development. She further suggested that the Chairman, after three to four weeks should arrange for informal consultations to consider the substantive issues raised in the non-paper such as how the need to take urgent action to deal with the crisis situation created by the declining prices of primary commodities could be addressed in the communiqué or any other document that might be prepared to reflect the results of the Cancún Ministerial Conference and how the future work in the CTD on the subject-matter should be organized in the period post the Cancún Ministerial Conference.

"4944",4944,"85","85.      She continued by saying that, with that description of the main points and of the proposals for action made in the non-paper, she would, before turning to the discussions on how future work in the Committee on that agenda item should be organized, make a few general observations. She said that she had earlier referred to the provisions of Part IV of GATT which applied primarily to developing countries. It was however worth noting that two agreements which were not based on those provisions, but aimed at supply management through taking measures for avoiding surpluses and shortages, had been negotiated during the Tokyo Round. Those were the Agreement on Bovine Meat and the Agreement on Diary Products. The latter Agreement also provided for a mechanism for the maintenance of prices at agreed levels. More recently there appeared to be considerable support among developed countries for the proposal to bring to the WTO for incorporation in its legal framework, the agreement which was under negotiations in OECD for reducing the structural oversupply of steel in world markets, through inter alia the acceptance by producing countries of greater discipline in the use of subsidies in that sector. The two Agreements on Bovine Meat and the Agreement on Diary Products had been terminated by the participating countries a few years back. The purpose of referring to those aspects of past developments in the GATT and to possible similar developments in the future work in the WTO, was to emphasis that the legal framework created by the WTO provided sufficient flexibility to take action for the stabilization of prices, taking into account special situations in the production and trade of specific commodities, provided that there were sufficient political will on the part of all Member countries to take such action.","WTCOMTDM45.pdf","Committee, GATT, Tokyo, WTO, OECD, GATT, WTO, WTO, Member"
"4943",4943,"84","84.     She further said that her delegation was aware that efforts were being made by international commodity organizations and some non-governmental organizations as well as by the producing countries themselves to find solutions to the problems posed by declining prices of primary commodities. Those included a proposal adopted by the International Coffee Organization that member countries should voluntarily agree to prohibit the export of coffee which did not meet certain minimum standards. She said that her delegation was aware that the cotton exporting countries from Africa had demanded that the WTO agree on a total ban on the granting of subsidies to cotton producers. Some of the producing countries appeared to be consulting among themselves on the                                                                                    WT/COMTD/M/45                                                                                           Page 25 desirability and feasibility of entering into arrangements for supply management for example for commodities like coffee and sugar. Even though those were steps in the right direction, the countries sponsoring the non-paper considered that those efforts needed to be complemented by focused and coordinated work in the WTO to seek long term solutions to the problems faced by primary exporting countries under its rule based system. The legal basis for such work in the WTO was provided by Article XXXVIII in Part IV of the GATT which inter alia stated that Member countries might take ""Joint action"" to negotiate, if necessary, international arrangements providing for ""measures designed to stabilize and improve conditions of world markets in these products, including measures designed to attain stable, equitable and remunerative prices for exports of primary products"". Taking those provisions of the GATT into account and the serious adverse impact which declining prices of primary commodities were having on the trade and economic development of exporting countries and on their efforts to alleviate poverty, the authors of the non-paper suggested that the CTD examine, on a priority basis, the impact which the crisis situation created by those developments was having on: the trade and development of countries which were heavily dependent on exports of primary commodities and on their capacity to pay and service their foreign debts. The non-paper identified an illustrative list of elements that could be included in the work programme that might be adopted as a result of such an examination.","WTCOMTDM45.pdf","International, Coffee, Organization, Africa, WTO, WTO, WTO, GATT, Member, GATT, CTD"
"4942",4942,"83","83.      The representative of Kenya said that she wished to introduce the non-paper contained in document WT/COMTD/W/113. She said that Members would recall that, at the last meeting of the Committee, held on 7 March 2003, her delegation had made a statement on behalf of the delegations of Kenya, Uganda, Tanzania, Lesotho and Zimbabwe expressing concern at the crisis situation created by declining prices of primary commodities and highlighting the need to address in the WTO discussions and negotiations the problems which that situation posed to the trade and development of the primary exporting countries. Her delegation had chosen to make a somewhat lengthy and detailed statement at that time as the non-paper, on which her delegation was working in cooperation with delegations from other Commonwealth developing countries and which contained some preliminary ideas on the action that could be taken under the WTO’s rule based system to deal with those problems, had not been ready by the time of that meeting. She said that she was glad that the non- paper had been circulated and that it now could provide a basis for discussions in the CTD. She said that she would therefore confine herself to emphasizing the main points that had been made in the non-paper. They included the following. First, that the prices of almost all primary commodities (both agricultural and minerals) had fallen to exceptionally low levels as compared to the levels that had prevailed in the twenty-year period from 1980 to 2000. Secondly, the main factor responsible for the decline in the prices of agricultural commodities was the imbalance between supply and demand. In the case of coffee and cocoa and some other commodities, the oversupply was structural in nature as the production consistently exceeded world demand. For commodities such as cotton, sugar and vegetable oils, which were produced both in the developed and developing countries, the primary reason for the prevailing low prices was the domestic and export subsidies (including export finance and credits) granted by some developed countries. In the case of sugar however, a domestic support policy managed by the European Union provided the benefit of higher guaranteed domestic prices to sugar imported from some developing countries. Third, the sharp decline in the prices of primary commodities had created a crisis situation in most commodity exporting countries as there was a close relationship between world market prices and poverty levels. The decline in prices of commodities had also resulted in a steep fall in foreign exchange earnings for about fifty developing countries which depended on three or fewer commodities for more than half of their exports. Thirty-seven of those countries had been categorized by the IMF and the World Bank as Heavily Indebted Poor Countries. Fourth, although the prices of some of the commodities had risen since the mid 2002, those increases appeared to be prompted either by poor harvests or by speculative buying due to political developments rather than reflecting any long term trend towards an improved balance between world demand and supply.","WTCOMTDM45.pdf","Kenya, Members, Committee, Kenya, Uganda, Tanzania, Lesotho, Zimbabwe, WTO, Commonwealth, WTO, CTD, European, Union, IMF, World, Bank"

"4939",4939,"80","80.      The Secretariat said that it did have plans to take the training of trainers concept beyond the Secretariat staff. However, that would not be the same kind of training. It had to be kept in mind that the internal training of trainers had essentially dealt with presentation skills and how to conduct a training activity, as most of the staff recruited by the Secretariat were not recruited for their didactic skills but were hired as they were experts in particular trade topics. However, that staff had increasingly been called upon to carry out training activities. The training of trainers activities that would be conducted outside the Secretariat would be different in the sense that they would involve capacity building for training in regional institutions. The focus would not be on the training skills as the academics the Secretariat was working with were assumed to have the capacity to teach. The aim of that training would rather be to assist with the development of curricula, expertise in WTO related matters which might not be their specialization, and generally move the focus to longer term capacity building of that nature. The two concepts of training of trainers were different, and the Secretariat was not transposing the training carried out in the Secretariat to the field.","WTCOMTDM45.pdf","Secretariat, Secretariat, Secretariat, Secretariat, Secretariat, WTO, Secretariat, Secretariat"

The Chairman recalled that, at previous sessions of the CTD, Members had agreed to invite the following intergovernmental organizations on an ad hoc, meeting-by-meeting basis: the Arab Maghreb Union (AMU); the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS); the Economic Cooperation Organisation (ECO); the Inter-Arab Investment Guarantee Corporation; the Islamic Development Bank (IDB); the Organisation of African Unity (OAU); the Organisation of the Islamic Conference (OIC); the South Centre; the South Pacific Forum; the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP); the West African Economic and Monetary Union (WAEMU); and the World Intellectual Property Organisation (WIPO).

The representative of the United States said that her delegation had noted that the Secretariat had spent a fair amount of its resources in the past year to train the trainers within the WTO Secretariat. Her delegation considered that to be an important initiative in view of the fact that WTO staff was often used for training purposes. However, she asked what the Secretariat's intention was in the coming year and whether the Secretariat intended to expand the training of trainers concept beyond the Secretariat. She noted that the Secretariat in previous discussions had mentioned that part of the purpose of the regional training programmes was the training of trainers, but wondered whether other such initiatives to take the training of trainers concept out of the Secretariat were considered.","WTCOMTDM45.pdf","United, States, Secretariat, WTO, Secretariat, WTO, Secretariat, Secretariat, Secretariat, Secretariat, Secretariat"

As Members were aware, the Training Institute which had been created in June 2001 had been merged with the Technical Cooperation Division to create the ITTC directed by Mr. Paul Rolian. The report on the training activities which Members had in front of them was thus the last one which would present the training activities of the former Training Institute in a separate manner from other WTO TA activities. The information regarding training activities would in the future be part of the quarterly reports on the training and technical cooperation activities. The report contained in document WT/COMTD/W/115 covered the period from 1 September 2002, which was the date of the last report, to 15 March 2003, which was the date of the reorganization of WTO's training and technical cooperation activities.","WTCOMTDM45.pdf","Chairman, Members, Training, Institute, Technical, Cooperation, Division, ITTC, Paul, Rolian, Members, Training, Institute, WTO, WTO"

"4933",4933,"75","75.      The Secretariat thanked delegations for their feedback on the note and for providing the Secretariat with further guidance on the trade policy clinics. No trade policy clinic had yet been held. However, the Government of Sierra Leone had requested a trade policy clinic. Sierra Leone was an example of a country emerging from civil war and the Secretariat was considering it as a possible candidate for a pilot trade policy clinic. The trade policy clinics would not be launched on a wide basis. They would respond to specific needs and be carried out in Member countries that met the set criteria. Based on the experience gained, the Secretariat would consult with Members and other agencies with which the WTO normally cooperated to get information regarding the security situations and other activities undertaken in each possible candidate country for a trade policy clinic. With respect to funding he said that the intention was to include the trade policy clinics in the 2004 TA Plan. Responses to a number of the questions posed by Members would find their answers once the draft 2004 TA Plan would be considered. The Secretariat had already began to consult with different groups of Members in preparation of the 2004 TA Plan. Members' ideas and the ideas of trade policy clinics and outsourcing would be reflected in that Plan. The Director-General had                                                                                      WT/COMTD/M/45                                                                                             Page 23 envisioned the trade policy clinics when he had heard of the 2003 TA Plan. He had since been involved in the elaboration of the trade policy clinics. The Secretariat would remain engaged and guided by Members in the further elaboration of trade policy clinics. The trade policy clinics would be funded as a TA project in 2003, using the DDAGTF. The Secretariat had a certain leverage as some money could be spent on ad hoc and other activities such as the trade policy clinics. However, the trade policy clinics would get a specific place in the 2004 TA Plan. He said that he would provide Members with additional information as the trade policy clinics evolved.","WTCOMTDM45.pdf","Secretariat, Secretariat, Sierra, Leone, Sierra, Leone, Secretariat, Member, Secretariat, Members, WTO, Members, Secretariat, Members, Members, Director-General, Secretariat, Members, Secretariat, Members"
"4932",4932,"74","74.      The representative of the European Communities said that his delegation was not entirely clear about what the trade policy clinics could provide. The Secretariat note did not make that much clearer as it suggested that the trade policy clinics could be useful in a number of situations and in different contexts such as dealing with crisis situations, filling gaps in the TA plans, assisting Members implement obligations and translating them into domestic legislation, enhancing capacity, playing a diagnostic role in determining needs, and supporting the requests of Members in need of TA. That indicated that there still were a number of tracks open and it was unclear which one of those would be favoured. His delegation was interested in the idea of having the trade policy clinics provide a standing framework which would enable the Secretariat to respond to needs that emerge at short notice during the course of a year and which could therefore not be planned. That was linked to the question of how to assess requests for ad hoc activities and how to decide which ones to respond to at what time. It was necessary to work with clear criteria given the existing human and other resource constraints. He said that a simple first come, first served response might not be adequate. If two or three crisis followed one after the other the Secretariat would soon be overwhelmed with demands that could not be met if it worked on that basis. He said that his delegation would welcome any opportunity to further discuss the trade policy clinics after the pilot clinic had been carried out. He asked what this would involve and when it would be undertaken. His delegation wished to ensure complementarily between the trade policy clinics and other activities, including those undertaken by other agencies or organisations. One example was countries which had recently emerged from crisis or conflict situations in which there often were a number of organizations working on the ground with the aim of assisting them to recover. The World Bank was often involved in such situations and if the WTO was to be involved as well it had to be clear that the WTO had a complementary role to play. Similarly, there was already the IF for the LDCs which included a process based on national plans and strategies. Again, anything done by the WTO in that context had to support the already existing exercises.","WTCOMTDM45.pdf","European, Communities, Secretariat, Members, Members, Secretariat, Secretariat, World, Bank, WTO, WTO, LDCs, WTO"
"4931",4931,"73","73.      The representative of the United States said that, since the Director-General had introduced the idea of trade policy clinics, her delegation had been intrigued by how it might be conceived. Document JOB(03)94 was helpful in that respect. It was appropriate to consider the trade policy clinics as an initial concept that would focus on crisis-type situations or unique problems. The large regular programme of TA should meet the other needs. However, the trade policy clinics might find their niche for those Members in particular need. Beginning with that focus seemed logical. Over time it could then be considered if there was a way to expand the trade policy clinics once they had been tested and proven to work. She noted that the note by the Secretariat did not mention how the trade policy clinics would be financed. She asked how their funding related to the 2003 TA Plan and the DDAGTF and whether the trade policy clinics would be part of the DDAGTF or separate. Her delegation agreed with the delegation of Mauritius that it was important to expand the tools available to meet the different needs of WTO Members.","WTCOMTDM45.pdf","United, States, Director-General, Members, Secretariat, Mauritius, WTO, Members"
"4930",4930,"72","72.     The representative of Tunisia said that his delegation agreed with the need to avoid any overlap in the provision of WTO TA. Nevertheless, the idea of trade policy clinics was an interesting one and the trade policy clinics were only in the process of being conceived. The trade policy clinics should constitute a pilot scheme to make developing countries aware of their rights in the WTO Agreements. His delegation therefore supported the statement made by the representative of Mauritania with respect to paragraph 3 of JOB(03)94. The trade policy clinics should not be limited to a few Members. It should rather be enlarged to all Members that needed it. WT/COMTD/M/45 Page 22","WTCOMTDM45.pdf","Tunisia, WTO, WTO, Mauritania, Members, Members"
"4929",4929,"71","71.      The representative of Mauritania said that paragraph 3 of document JOB(03)94 had drawn his delegation's attention as it stated that ""...a country which already benefits from the Integrated Framework (IF) or JITAP should not be able to request a clinic."" It was logical to give priority to a certain group of countries as mentioned in the document. However, it was also logical that all useful WTO services should be extended to a larger number of beneficiaries. The possibility should remain open for other Members to benefit from the trade policy clinics in the future, keeping in mind the capacity of the trade policy clinics, the nature of the requests and the resources available.","WTCOMTDM45.pdf","Mauritania, WTO, Members"
"4928",4928,"70","70.      The representative of Switzerland said that the trade policy clinics were an attractive tool. The trade policy clinics were indicative of the need of some countries to have a better dialogue with the WTO and receive practical support in the application of their trade policies. The trade policy clinics were in that sense closely related to regular TA. However, he said that it might be difficult to restrict that type of service to emergencies or to a category of countries that could not be easily defined. His delegation therefore wished to gain more experience from the implementation of trade policy clinics. A decision might then be taken to offer them to a wider group of beneficiaries. Trade policy clinics should be seen as a transitional solution that went in the direction of something that had been discussed in the context of special and differential treatment (S&D) which was to create a possibility of monitoring, defined in that context in respect to differential treatment for developing countries and LDCs in particular. His delegation believed that what was needed over time was a working relationship between the Members and the Secretariat in specific countries to assist those Members to use the opportunities of S&D and build institutions to enhance their ability to comply with trade rules. That should, in the longer term, be seen as an extension of the Trade Policy Reviews which, at the present time, were the only instrument of direct contact with Members at the working level. The trade policy clinics should be considered as a transitional scheme and a pilot experience in view of a future extension of the services of the Secretariat but also of the Members in the sense that such an activity would imply a peer review of national action plans by WTO bodies. Members would also have to take the costs of any extension of the trade policy clinics into account.","WTCOMTDM45.pdf","Switzerland, WTO, LDCs, Members, Secretariat, Members, Members, Secretariat, Members, WTO, Members"

The criteria identified for the holding of trade policy clinics were legitimate as the trade policy clinics would target WTO Members emerging from crises, transition economies and small economies. Many Members wished to make efforts to integrate into the multilateral trading system. However, the situation in countries emerging from conflicts such as Rwanda would merit real capacity building at all levels. The Government of Rwanda was currently engaged in a real liberalization effort and deserved to be assisted. Trade was one of the most important means to rid countries of poverty and he was confident that the UN goals to reduce poverty would by met before 2015. His Government was committed to reducing poverty to 25 per cent of Rwanda's population by 2015. The WTO could continue to provide capacity building activities to assist his Government in its efforts.","WTCOMTDM45.pdf","Rwanda, WTO, WTO, Members, Members, Rwanda, Rwanda, UN, Rwanda, WTO"

He went on to speak about the regional dimension of the trade policy clinics and said that there was a need to determine, in advance, the full range of issues of common interest to the Members of the region. That was an important element of the approach that the Secretariat was taking. His delegation agreed that there was a need to avoid duplication. Each Member should take that as a warning to ensure that there was no duplication. There was no doubt that the trade policy clinics would be needs-based and would succeed. The Secretariat had the infrastructure and the human                                                                                     WT/COMTD/M/45                                                                                            Page 21 resources necessary to carry them out. However, their success was contingent on the necessary funds being made available. His delegation was aware of the efforts made by donor partners and reiterated his delegation's gratitude for their continued support. The trade policy clinics was a new and commendable initiative to which he was certain that the donor partners would respond adequately.","WTCOMTDM45.pdf","Members, Secretariat, Member, Secretariat"
"4924",4924,"67","67.      The representative of Mauritius said that his delegation had noted with interest the functional details of the trade policy clinics initiative. His delegation appreciated that priority was going to be given to countries emerging from crisis or conflict situations. He was also happy to note that it would encompass the interests of transition economies and small economies as that was of particular interest to his delegation. The trade policy clinics were welcome as there was a need to carry out a diagnosis of the problems and issues related to small economies, as provided for in the Doha Development Agenda. Paragraph 35 of the Doha Ministerial Declaration contained the specific mandate which required the framing of responses to the problems and needs of the small economies. The trade policy clinics was an important instrument in the developmental tool-box of the WTO. It would be a good complement to already existing tools. It was his understanding that once a trade policy clinic had been undertaken on a pilot basis, an evaluation of its efficiency would be undertaken. He believed that it was good to assess the trade policy clinics as early as possible and determine possible lessons that could improve future delivery. If the experience with the first trade policy clinic would not be conclusive, he hoped that remedies would be sought to make them more meaningful in the future. The aim of the trade policy clinics was to ensure that Members were empowered to strike the right balance between their rights and obligations. It was therefore important to recognize that the trade policy clinics had to be designed to feed into the regular WTO TA and capacity building programmes. He said that if the trade policy clinics were to be successful, they would have to be backed by earmarked funds. It was unhelpful to have a TA programme, the implementation of which was uncertain. No TA activity was implemented without the back-up of financial resources.","WTCOMTDM45.pdf","Mauritius, Doha, Development, Agenda, WTO, Members, WTO"
"4923",4923,"66","66.      The Secretariat said that a note on ""trade policy clinics"" had been circulated to Members as JOB/(03)94. That note focused and expanded on three main aspects of the trade policy clinics: scope, beneficiaries, and modalities for the implementation of trade policy clinics. First, the Secretariat had refined the scope of the trade policy clinics. The trade policy clinics would be demand-driven and tailored to come up with practical recommendations on specific trade-policy concerns of the requesting Members in areas that would not be covered by the Secretariat's present TA activities. The trade policy clinics would also provide the Secretariat with a mechanism to respond quickly and flexibly to crises or urgent TA needs over the course of 2003. Features could include preliminary assessments of technical cooperation and capacity building needs and, where appropriate, be fed into the WTO regular training/TA process. Second, the Secretariat had initially identified three groups of beneficiaries that would have priority: countries emerging from crises or conflicts which needed to start from ""ground zero"" in developing their trade regime as their institutional capacity had been destroyed in conflicts for example; countries in transition which had an urgent need for market- oriented legislative and trade policy assistance; and small economies which faced specific problems. Moreover, the Secretariat would also take into account whether requesting Members benefited from other major TA programmes before making a final selection of beneficiaries. Third, like any other training/TA activity, the trade policy clinics would be coordinated, administered and delivered by the ITTC. Due to their related experience, the Trade Policies Review Division and the Development Division would be closely associated. Furthermore, the ITTC would seek to involve and build synergies with other international organisations whose particular expertise would be relevant to the needs of the beneficiary. Finally, the Secretariat hoped to organise, in the near future, a pilot trade policy clinic in order to test its ideas and gain operational experience. That would enable the Secretariat to elaborate further on that TA product and revert to Members for more guidance. The Secretariat said that Members' inputs would contribute to refining the concept and ensure that it effectively met Members' needs.","WTCOMTDM45.pdf","Secretariat, Members, Secretariat, Members, Secretariat, Secretariat, WTO, Secretariat, Secretariat, Members, ITTC, Development, Division, ITTC, Secretariat, Secretariat, Members, Secretariat, Members, Members"

"4921",4921,"64","64.      The Secretariat continued by saying that it concurred with Members' wish for a regionally balanced choice of consultants and institutions to outsource to. It also agreed with the delegation of Japan that the issue of neutrality of consultants was important. The TA Audit had a role to play in that respect. It was also important to note that the Secretariat would only outsource some aspects of an activity, and not the activity as a whole. The Secretariat would continue to play the lead role in all WTO TA activities. Outside expertise would only supplement and support work done by the WTO Secretariat itself. The Secretariat would consequently be monitoring how consultants respected the requirements of objectivity and high standards. That monitoring could be further enhanced if the capacity of the WTO TA Audit was enhanced. With respect to the issue of funding raised by the representative of Australia the Secretariat said that outsourcing was not a new activity. Outsourcing was a continuing activity that needed to be re-evaluated, focussed and controlled as it had grown much in the recent past. The remuneration of consultants would continue at the same level as in the past. Outsourcing had to be considered from a cost-benefit perspective. The possibility of increasing the strength of the Secretariat should always be considered as opposed to outsourcing and vice versa. The representative of Japan had asked a question relating to MoUs and cost sharing and the Secretariat responded that it was moving towards a cost-sharing of fifty-fifty through more formalized agreements with other organizations elaborated in the MoUs. The Secretariat would have to look more closely at the particular case mentioned by the representative of Japan. It knew of situations where it had contributed 75 per cent of the cost while regional economic institutions had contributed 25 per cent of the cost of activities in which they played minor roles. However, it had to be kept in mind that regional economic institutions such as ESCAP and ECA also often contributed expertise to joint activities. The idea was to build tripartite relationships in terms of cost-sharing between such UN commissions, regional development banks and the WTO. The Secretariat concluded by saying that it would be pleased to provide further information if Members so requested.

"4920",4920,"63","63.      The Secretariat said that it appreciated the comments made by Members and that the Secretariat would remain guided by the CTD which continued to oversee WTO's TA and development work. In response to the issues raised by the representative of the European Communities the Secretariat said that academics and Government officials with relevant expertise would be considered when outsourcing. Members would be asked to complement the WTO roster. With respect to the issue of strategy, the Secretariat said that the CTD would remain the principal guide and strategy setting body for the Secretariat's TA work. The Secretariat was encouraged that the CTD intended to remain engaged in TA and committed to its guiding role. As far as the outsourcing project was concerned, the Secretariat said that it had outsourced for a long time. Outsourcing was thus nothing new, even if the Committee believed that it should be more organized to bring all issues related to outsourcing into perspective. The Secretariat had prepared the note to introduce some focus and strategic planning to outsourcing. Quality control was an issue that concerned Members and the Secretariat alike. It was linked to the issue of the resources available to the TA Audit. With respect to regional academic institutions the Secretariat said that it already was working with a number of such institutions. That cooperation had been intensified in Africa in the context of the three months training courses. The trainers at the ongoing three months training course in Nairobi came from different universities and institutions. They had just briefed about the deliberations in the CTD. Two of the participants in the three months training course in Nairobi had also been present at the launch of the training of trainers programme and had been consulted in the preparation of the Secretariat note. The Secretariat note was thus the result of consultations with individuals, institutions, delegations, governments, donors, regional institutions and academics.","WTCOMTDM45.pdf","Secretariat, Members, Secretariat, CTD, WTO, European, Communities, the, Secretariat, Members, WTO, Secretariat, CTD, Secretariat, Secretariat, TA, Secretariat, Committee, Secretariat, Members, Secretariat, Secretariat, Africa, Nairobi, CTD, Nairobi, Secretariat, Secretariat"

The outsourcing exercise was a good step towards the democratisation of WTO's TA and capacity building. His delegation hoped that outsourcing would achieve the aim of bringing a balance to WTO's TA by using resources from outside the system.

The representative of the United States said that her delegation was among those who believed that the concept of outsourcing had to be considered in order for the WTO to achieve what it had to achieve in the regular TA plan. The needs would always be greater than the ability to deliver, particularly as the Secretariat's expertise was critical for the negotiations themselves. Her delegation shared many of the questions that had been raised by other delegations, and in particular the points mentioned by the representative of the European Communities on the types of projects best suited for outside experts, the types of organizational skills that it would be most helpful to match with different types of projects to ensure that the right individuals or organisations were engaged, and the point made that evaluation and selection criteria had to be established.","WTCOMTDM45.pdf","United, States, WTO, Secretariat"
"4917",4917,"60","60.      The representative of Japan said that the issue of outsourcing was important and his delegation appreciated the general direction of the Secretariat note. The limited financial and human resources of the Secretariat could be used more efficiently by strengthening the Secretariat's cooperation with outside experts and regional organizations with certain comparative advantages. Relating partly to the comments made by the delegations of the European Communities and India, he said that neutrality was a core issue when considering outsourcing. If a former Japanese Ambassador or official was recruited to train, he would be well aware of the position of the Government of Japan. He therefore asked for examples of areas where outsourcing would be efficient and effective taking the neutrality aspect into account. Second, with respect to MoUs, he said that paragraph 22(b) on page 5 of the Secretariat Note stated that ""So far, WTO has generally financed a significant portion of the budget of any TA activity organised jointly with other organisations (more than 50 per cent on average)."" However, when the Secretariat had been asked about its cost sharing with other organizations during the discussion of the 2003 TA Plan, it had responded that it applied the principle that each organization paid half of the cost for joint activities. He said that he realized that there were different types of cooperation where one organization might only be a co-organizer, taking responsibility for less than half of the activity. He asked the Secretariat to clarify the rules it followed in such situations. He said that the reason why he asked that question was that the Government of Japan had both contributed to the DDAGTF and funded other organizations' parts of their joint activities with the WTO. Other organizations had requested funding for half of the cost of activities delivered in collaboration with the WTO. He said that he therefore was surprised that the WTO sometimes had paid more than half of the cost.","WTCOMTDM45.pdf","Japan, Secretariat, Secretariat, Secretariat, India, Ambassador, Japan, MoUs, Secretariat, Note, WTO, Secretariat, Secretariat, Japan, WTO, WTO, WTO"

The representative of Australia said that her delegation had a number of questions with respect to the Secretariat note but appreciated that that meeting might not be the time to canvass all of them. Her delegation, as other delegations, had a general interest in how the funding of outsourced activities was envisaged. She also requested more information on guidelines and criteria for the selection of suitable consultants, whether such guidelines were necessary and how they would be constructed. The Secretariat would have an important future role in evaluating the output of consultants and other institutions. It would therefore be useful to begin to discuss processes for evaluation at an early stage. When considering the cost of outsourcing, the rates suggested in the note should be compared to the cost of having Secretariat staff perform similar duties.","WTCOMTDM45.pdf","Australia, Secretariat, Secretariat, Secretariat"
"4914",4914,"58","58.     The representative of India said that Members had discussed the issue of outsourcing at the last meeting of the CTD. The note by the Secretariat provided a basis for further reflection on the concept of outsourcing of WTO's TA activities. Two suggestions had been made during the previous discussion of the issue. One was the importance of involving and using the expertise of regional academic institutions. That linkage had to be considered while developing any roster of experts as it could have positive spill-over effects. He understood that the former WTO Training Institute had been trying to develop such linkages with regional academic institutions. The second issue related to the development of the roster itself. Footnote 2 in the Secretariat note indicated that an initial roster WT/COMTD/M/45 Page 18 already existed based on names provided by Members. The aim seemed to be to broaden that roster. The idea discussed at the last meeting was to ensure a balance between developing and developed country experts. It would be useful for Members to keep that in mind in their further consideration of the issue. However, it was of primary importance that any expert engaged had the requisite expertise, as outlined in paragraph 7 of the Secretariat note. A third issue for Members to consider was the role the CTD should play in developing and monitoring the roster.","WTCOMTDM45.pdf","India, Members, CTD, Secretariat, WTO, WTO, Training, Institute, Secretariat, Members, Members, Secretariat, Members, CTD"
"4913",4913,"57","57.     The representative of the European Communities said that outsourcing was an important issue on which further reflection was needed to ensure that WTO's comparative advantage was maintained. Other agencies should be used to deliver TA where that made sense. He noted the focus on two potential sources of outsourcing: consultants and partner institutions. His delegation encouraged the Secretariat to consider using other potential sources such as national government entities, universities and other academic institutions, and management schools. His delegation wished to see something more than a descriptive picture of how consultants and partner institutions were used, what the procedures were, how the registry of consultants was established and how the MoUs with partner agencies were set up. His delegation requested a more long-term perspective stating the strategy and goals of outsourcing in the coming years. He said that he realized that the Secretariat might throw that question back to the Members with the argument that the Secretariat can not do that for the Members. He was not suggesting that the Secretariat decide the strategy and the goals for outsourcing without guidance from the Members, but the issue had to be debated. His delegation also had questions related to the types of activities suitable and the ones not suitable for outsourcing and if particular institutions and delivery agents were more appropriate than others in certain circumstances. That required further discussion in preparing the 2004 TA Plan and future plans. When using outsourcing there were questions of quality control. Members would look to the Secretariat to ensure quality. Other questions such as monitoring and evaluation were also relevant. It is possible that the Secretariat felt that it was difficult enough to evaluate the activities it carried out itself and that it might be even more difficult to evaluate and track activities undertaken by others. His delegation welcomed the ideas expressed in the note by the Secretariat even though they left some questions open.","WTCOMTDM45.pdf","European, Communities, WTO, Secretariat, MoUs, Secretariat, Members, Secretariat, Members, Secretariat, Members, Members, Secretariat, Secretariat, Secretariat"
"4912",4912,"56","56.     The Secretariat continued by saying that the second part of its note on outsourcing contained a report on WTO cooperation with other international institutions and described the process undertaken by the Secretariat to come up with an effective and coherent approach to partnerships aimed at         1             Subsequently issued as documents WT/COMTD/W/116 and WT/COMTD/W/117 respectively.         2             WT/COMTD/8                                                                                      WT/COMTD/M/45                                                                                             Page 17 fostering outsourcing and joint activities in training and TA. The Secretariat’s current policy was clearly reiterated in the note. That policy underlined that inter-agency arrangements and strategic partnerships were essential in order to respond fully to the significant mandate on TA in the Doha Ministerial Declaration. Those arrangements were also necessary in areas outside the strict competence of the WTO. One example was the involvement of UNCTAD in trade and investment activities. Such partner institutions, at the global and regional levels, had been progressively identified over the years, and many activities had taken place in areas identified for intensified cooperation. The WTO Secretariat had endeavoured over the past 18 months to develop and formalize its cooperation with different partners at the international and regional level in order to respond adequately to the Doha Development Agenda mandates. That cooperation was generally embodied in MoUs signed with WTO’s partners. The Secretariat had also engaged in reformulating pre-existing MoUs to render them relevant to the Doha Development Agenda. The Secretariat was introducing some basic elements that embodied a clearer approach to the main administrative aspects of MoUs in order to allow a more coherent policy on partnerships with other organizations. That would allow the WTO to present its potential partners with a standard agreement as a basis for negotiations. As a result, the Secretariat would be able to deepen its consultations with partner institutions during the preparation of future annual plans for training and TA and make the best use of their comparative advantages in the areas of specialisation as well as in financial and other matters governed by the provisions of the MoUs in force. To that end and for coherence purposes, the Secretariat would also make full use of the WTO/OECD Doha Development Agenda Trade Capacity Building Database.","WTCOMTDM45.pdf","Secretariat, WTO, Secretariat, TA, Secretariat, WTO, UNCTAD, WTO, Secretariat, Doha, Development, Agenda, MoUs, WTO, Secretariat, Doha, Development, Agenda, Secretariat, MoUs, WTO, Secretariat, MoUs, Secretariat"
"4911",4911,"55","55.      The Secretariat said that it was pleased to introduce a comprehensive note on outsourcing contained in document JOB(03)/93. That note built on the Secretariat's report at the 44th session of the CTD and explained in more detail the approach of the Secretariat to increase outsourcing of TA activities to outside consultants and to other international organisations. The first part of the note dealt with individual consultants and provided details about the new WTO roster and the modalities for its use. Under the new approach, the system for outsourcing was made more predictable to ensure fairness and transparency. While following basic principles regarding overall WTO objectives in that area, he said that the Secretariat would retain flexibility to fulfil its mandate in conformity with the Guidelines for WTO Technical Cooperation adopted by the CTD.2 An official WTO roster of consultants was in preparation and would be managed by the Human Resources Section. It would consist of two separate lists: the ""General List"" and the ""Selected List"". The present roster would become part of the ""General List"", which would be expanded through spontaneous applications from candidates and through suggestions from WTO Divisions, Members, other intergovernmental organizations or partners. Delegations would be reminded of the possibility of recommending names for inclusion in the roster. Experts to be considered for inclusion in the roster would essentially be former trade policy diplomats/officials, former GATT/WTO staff members, academics, recognised experts in a specific field, trainers, and officials from other international organizations and recognised bodies. The ""Selected List"" of the roster would contain only the names of tested experts. It would be possible for any Division of the WTO to hire the consultants on that second list of the Roster directly for appropriate missions following a simplified procedure. On the basis of the Annual Plan for Training and Technical Cooperation and inputs from relevant divisions, the ITTC would evaluate the WTO Secretariat's needs in terms of outsourcing. While the Human Resources Section would manage the roster, the ITTC would coordinate the selection of consultants from the roster for each activity, in order to ensure effective delivery of TA and full implementation of the TA plan.","WTCOMTDM45.pdf","Secretariat, Secretariat, CTD, Secretariat, WTO, WTO, Secretariat, WTO, Technical, Cooperation, CTD, WTO, Human, Resources, Section, WTO, Members, GATT/WTO, WTO, ITTC, WTO, Secretariat, Human, Resources, Section, ITTC"

The Chairman said that, at the 44th session of the CTD, the Secretariat had presented a progress report on its ongoing work to explore the possibility of outsourcing more TA activities to outside consultants and to other international and regional organisations. After having offered preliminary information on the modalities for a roster of individual consultants as well as on MoUs for effective and coherent partnerships, the Secretariat had indicated that a more comprehensive document on outsourcing would be circulated before the next meeting of the Committee. At the same session, the Secretariat had also provided a general outline on the Director-General's idea of ""Trade policy clinics"" and had indicated that an information note which elaborated the concept (scope, objectives and modalities) as well as on the possible beneficiaries would be circulated before the 45th Session. Those two documents were contained in JOB(03)/93 and JOB(03)94, both dated 16 May 2003.1","WTCOMTDM45.pdf","Chairman, CTD, Secretariat, MoUs, Secretariat, Committee, Secretariat, Director-General"

"4906",4906,"50","50.      The Secretariat said that Members had before them document JOB(03)97 which contained four tables. The first two tables presented the situation with respect to pledges made and funds transferred by donors to the Doha Development Agenda Global Trust Fund (DDAGTF). The third table presented a synthesis of all trust funds used to finance TA activities, whether included in the 2003 TA Plan or not. The fourth table summarized all pledges made to all trust funds, including the DDAGTF over the coming four years. Taking into account the pledges made for 2002 which had not been transformed into actual contributions on 1 January 2003, the balance left in the DDAGTF at the end of 2002 and the pledges made for 2003, just over Sw F 19 million were currently pledged to the Doha Development Agenda Global Trust Fund. Pledges made which were earmarked for certain types of activities or certain beneficiaries which could be used to finance activities included in the 2003 TA Plan amounted to an additional Sw F 2 million. That meant that the resources available amounted to Sw F 21 million in total. That was Sw F 3 million short of the Sw F 24 million agreed as the target amount for the DDAGTF in 2003. Turning to the cash situation, he said that the terms of reference of the DDAGTF defined precise thresholds for the disbursement of the contributions. The second threshold stipulated that 75 per cent of the funds should have been received by the end of March 2003. That deadline had been missed by a large margin. Only Sw F 13,2 million had been received by the end of March 2003 which was clearly short of the Sw F 18 million that 75 per cent of Sw F 24 million represented. The third threshold was at the end of June 2003 when all of the Sw F 24 million should be in the bank. As the pledges did not even amount to Sw F 24 million, he said that it seemed unlikely that that threshold would be met. That did not mean that the Secretariat had yet encountered a cash problem. It had a balance of Sw F 3 million in the DDAGTF which was sufficient for some time but certainly not for the Secretariat to ensure the implementation of the 2003 TA Plan until the end of the year.","WTCOMTDM45.pdf","Secretariat, Members, Doha, Development, Agenda, Global, Trust, Fund, Doha, Development, Agenda, Global, Trust, Fund, Secretariat, Secretariat"

Ambassador Mansour's experience in the biodiversity convention negotiations would be of particular value when the CTD considered the question of the development dimension of the relationship between trade and the environment.

"4902",4902,"47","47.      The Secretariat went on to speak about strategic partnerships and said that it had taken some time to formulate the MoU between UNCTAD and the WTO. That MoU formalized a well functioning relationship that the WTO had had with UNCTAD since a long time back. The MoU formalized that cooperation and clarified the basis for the financing and co-financing of activities. It laid down rules for agreed activities between the two agencies and in particular the responsibilities of the other agency in situations where one agency was the lead agency for a particular activity. Such situations had been clarified and the two agencies had begun to follow the procedures set out in the MoU as of the date of its signature. The Secretariat said that the fourth issue was the question of the content of the quarterly reports and how to make them more evaluative. Members had to be clear about the purpose of the quarterly reports. The quarterly reports were primarily intended to be monitoring reports. They were not intended as reports that would evaluate and assess the effectiveness, relevance and sustainability of the activities implemented. He maintained that the critical mass of activities that was needed for such an evaluation was not available with the around 60 activities carried out each quarter. However, some lessons of particular importance which might be used to adjust the implementation of the remaining activities that year might emerge from some of the                                                                                    WT/COMTD/M/45                                                                                           Page 15 activities implemented. Such lessons would be brought to Members' attention together with information about how the Secretariat intended to deal with them. However, the quarterly reports were not intended as full fledged evaluations. Regarding what information Members would have at the time they would be asked to agree to the 2004 TA Plan, the Secretariat said that it was conscious of the comments that had been made in 2002 in connection with the adoption of the 2003 TA Plan. It believed that when Members would have the draft 2004 TA Plan in front of them they would realize that the Secretariat had given recognition to what Members had said in 2002. The Secretariat was aiming to state clear objectives for the activities included in the 2004 TA Plan. That might make it easier for Members to judge whether what the Secretariat was proposing was reasonable or not. There would be clear differences in the structure of the 2004 TA Plan as compared to the 2003 TA Plan. Regarding the plea for flexibility the Secretariat said that that was something it did keep in mind. Finally, the Secretariat would give due consideration to any requests for interpretation during TA activities.","WTCOMTDM45.pdf","Secretariat, UNCTAD, WTO, WTO, UNCTAD, Secretariat, Members, Members, Secretariat, Members, Secretariat, Members, Secretariat, Members, Secretariat, Members, Secretariat, Secretariat, Secretariat"
"4901",4901,"46","46.      The Secretariat said that it agreed with the suggestions made by the representative of the United States and supported by other delegations regarding how to improve the reporting mechanism. It should be possible to include more information of a factual nature such as the number of participants and the number of countries involved in regional activities in the quarterly reports. The Secretariat would consider including such information in the Second Quarterly Report. The Second Quarterly Report would also include information on the training activities, which for the current meeting had been the subject of a separate paper. The Second Quarterly Report would thus provide delegations with a full picture of all activities carried out in the second quarter in one document. With respect to the costs, the Secretariat was conscious of the fact that the way in which it reported implementation might not be satisfactory in the sense that a three months trade policy course and a one day workshop each counted as one activity implemented. There was something wrong with that way of reporting and the Secretariat was considering how to present that information in a more meaningful way, possibly in terms of staff days involved or cost per participant per day for example. The second main question posed was whether the Secretariat could provide any additional information on the pace of implementation since the end of March 2003. The Secretariat said that it was pleased to report that the pace of implementation had increased considerably since the end of March 2003. In fact, the Secretariat had carried out the same number of activities in the six week period since the end of March 2003 as it had during the first three months. The pace of implementation was clearly accelerating and the Secretariat hoped to accelerate it even further. The implementation would be particularly intensive from then on and leading up to the Fifth Ministerial Conference as all activities linked to the Fifth Ministerial Conference had to be implemented in a timely manner. The implementation rate had been negatively effected by the recent geopolitical and international medical events. However, there was unfortunately nothing the Secretariat could do to change that situation even though such events did have an impact on the TA delivery rate.","WTCOMTDM45.pdf","Secretariat, United, States, Secretariat, Secretariat, Secretariat, Secretariat, Secretariat, Secretariat, Secretariat, Secretariat"
"4900",4900,"45","45.      The representative of Mauritania said that his delegation wished to inform Members about the situation with respect to the implementation of activities in Mauritania. His Government considered the situation satisfactory as a national trade policy course had already been held to the benefit of some 30 officials from different ministries concerned with international trade such as the Ministry of Commerce, the Ministry of Agriculture, and the Ministry of Finance. Second, a national seminar on trade and investment benefiting some 30 officials had been held in May 2003. Third, a mission to establish a Reference Centre was currently underway in Mauritania and his Government hoped that a national follow-up seminar would be organized in June 2003 following the results of the Trade Policy WT/COMTD/M/45 Page 14 Review of Mauritania which had been held in September 2002. The implementation rate for activities in Mauritania in the first semester might thus be 100 per cent. However, the low rate of implementation still posed two problems for other WTO Members as well as for the Secretariat. The first was to reconcile the planned activities with Members', and particularly LDC Members', ad hoc requests. It was therefore necessary to ensure a certain flexibility to meet such requests. Second, there was the problem of the increasing cost of the national activities. However, national activities responded to specific needs of the Members. One example was the cost for the interpretation requested by Governments such as his, as many officials in Mauritania worked in Arabic. It would therefore be useful to have interpretation in Arabic for activities in Mauritania and there might be a need for interpretation into other languages for national activities held in other WTO Member countries. He said that the implementation of TA activities for Mauritania was satisfactory and he hoped that it would continue in that manner.","WTCOMTDM45.pdf","Mauritania, Members, Mauritania, Ministry, of, Commerce, Ministry, of, Agriculture, Ministry, of, Finance, Mauritania, Mauritania, Mauritania, WTO, Members, Secretariat, Members, Members, Members, Mauritania, Mauritania, WTO, Member, Mauritania"

The representative of Switzerland said that he wished to ask the same question as had been posed earlier on how the Secretariat believed the rhythm of implementation of the 2003 TA Plan could be improved since it was below target in the first quarter. Second, he had a question relating to the evaluation of TA activities. Paragraph 13 of the Quarterly Report stated that a certain critical mass of activities was necessary in order to assess the implementation. Reference was also made to the 2002 Technical Cooperation Audit (WT/COMTD/W/111 and Corr.1). He therefore asked whether the Secretariat intended to include a section on evaluations in future quarterly reports, evaluations which he assumed would have to be carried out by the Technical Cooperation Audit and not by the ITTC. He further asked how the Secretariat planned the assessment for 2004. He reminded the Secretariat that a number of Members had had problems in approving the 2003 TA Plan as they considered that the 2002 activities had not been evaluated properly. He asked what type of evaluation and assessment would be available to Members at the time when Members would be asked to approve the 2004 TA Plan. An evaluation of the 2003 activities would be necessary in order for Members to take decisions for 2004 based on sound evidence of what would work and what would not work.","WTCOMTDM45.pdf","Switzerland, Secretariat, Corr, Secretariat, ITTC, Secretariat, Secretariat, Members, Members, Members, Members"

The representative of the European Communities said that his delegation agreed with the suggestions made by the representative of the United States for the inclusion of additional information on the number of participants and additional raw information that would be useful for assessment purposes such as the back-to-office reports. In addition to those suggestions, he said that his delegation wished to make two other points. First, the Secretariat had indicated that, at the end of March, the implementation of the 2003 TA Plan was still below expectations. His delegation shared the wish for the delivery rate to increase and the set targets to be achieved. Six weeks had passed since the end of March. He therefore asked the Secretariat to inform Members about whether the pace of implementation was increasing. It was especially important that some of the training activities relating to the Doha Development Agenda subjects be implemented before the Fifth Ministerial Conference. He said that his second question related to strategic partnerships with other bodies. The Quarterly Report referred to a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with the International Institute for Trade and Development. A WTO press release had also referred to a MoU with UNCTAD. He asked how the WTO would cooperate with those two organisations and what the MoUs would mean in terms of co-financing. The Quarterly Report was an overall positive tool containing useful information in relation to the delivery of the 2003 TA Plan in the first quarter of the year. The Quarterly Report should be seen as a part of the overall steady quality improvement and the management and the provision of information on WTO TA activities.","WTCOMTDM45.pdf","European, Communities, United, States, Secretariat, Secretariat, Members, International, Institute, for, Trade, and, Development, WTO, UNCTAD, WTO, MoUs, WTO"

The representative of the United States said that the Quarterly Report was a valuable tool in examining how the WTO was doing with respect to meeting the objectives of the 2003 TA Plan. She said that her delegation wished to make some suggestions for how to improve the quarterly reports to make them more useful for Member governments, even if she was unsure about how those changes would be made in practice. Several pieces of information were lacking from the Quarterly Report which would be useful to bilateral donors who wished to complement WTO's activities and who                                                                                     WT/COMTD/M/45                                                                                            Page 13 wished to define priorities for the following year. One such piece of information was the actual number of participants in each of the activities. Another was information about the countries represented as participants in regional activities. While she was aware that there was a lag in the process of budgeting versus the planning and implementation of the projects, she said that it would be useful for Members to receive information on the relative cost of the different projects implemented. That was linked to the assessment of the efficiency and effectiveness of different kinds of projects. Such figures would assist Members in getting an idea of the number of participants reached by a certain type of activity and the cost of that activity. Those would thus be useful pieces of information for Members from a management and development standpoint.","WTCOMTDM45.pdf","United, States, WTO, Member, WTO, Members, Members, Members"

The Secretariat went on to refer to some of the more specific comments and said that it would be possible to provide more tabular and quantitative information in future reports. The database that had been developed would help in that regard and the Secretariat would attempt to provide more such information. The methodological changes that the Report referred to, and that many Members had supported, would also be introduced. The Technical Cooperation Audit would insist that all TA providers provide feedback from their activities in all instances when the Technical Cooperation Audit could not directly observe an activity. One delegation had mentioned that it was surprised that only 15 activities had been evaluated directly. That too was an issue of resources. The 15 activities directly observed meant more than one trip per month assuming that there were only about ten working months a year. If more was to be done, more staff resources were needed. The Technical Cooperation Audit would otherwise have to rely on self evaluation, which on the whole, the Technical Cooperation Audit believed had produced the results hoped for. Nevertheless, the self evaluations could be further improved and work would be undertaken to that effect. Several delegations had mentioned the needs assessments. The needs assessments were a critical aspect of the planning process. It was linked to the setting of clear objectives which in turn had an impact on the quality of the evaluation. If the objectives were not clearly defined at the outset, it would be unclear for the Technical Cooperation Audit what objectives it was supposed to evaluate an activity against. The Secretariat hoped to improve the 2004 Technical Cooperation Plan in that respect.","WTCOMTDM45.pdf","Secretariat, Secretariat, Members, Technical, Cooperation, Audit, Technical, Cooperation, Audit, Secretariat"
"4892",4892,"38","38.    The Secretariat said that it was its intention to carefully study all the comments made in the Technical Cooperation Audit Report as well as those made by Members. The Secretariat would WT/COMTD/M/45 Page 12 attempt to incorporate as many of them as possible in the future delivery of TA. The kind of changes that many delegations wished to see might not be possible to undertake in the immediate future as their introduction required some time. However, all suggestions would be given due consideration. Members had said that they wished to see the delivery of TA based on quality rather than quantity. That was already part of the Secretariat's thinking. All Members seemed to agree that sustainability was important, although it was a difficult issue. Possibly shifting the balance somewhat from some of the more disparate and short activities traditionally conducted to longer term institutional capacity building might automatically improve the record with respect to sustainability. The Technical Cooperation Audit had repeatedly made the point to Members that the resources devoted to evaluation were inadequate. Several Members had said that they wished to see something more from the Technical Cooperation Audit even if Members recognized that that required more resources. The Technical Cooperation Audit could do more if more resources were given to it. Some Members had supported the idea of a multi-year approach as referred to in the report. However, that also raised the question of resources, although in a different sense as one Member had mentioned, referring to the fact that the resources for TA were on the whole extra budgetary resources and therefore suffered from the unpredictability that accompanied an annual exercise of gathering resources for TA. The budgetisation of TA was an old issue. Nevertheless, if Members wished a multi-year approach to TA, they had to consider its financial implications.","WTCOMTDM45.pdf","Secretariat, Members, Secretariat, Members, Secretariat, Members, Members, Members, Members, Members, Member, Members, TA"
"4891",4891,"37","37.      The representative of the Kyrgyz Republic said that his Government attached great importance to the participation of officials in TA activities which could lead to a more effective integration of the Kyrgyz Republic in the multilateral trading system. Officials from the Kyrgyz Republic had benefited from the training the countries of the European Union had provided to his Government. He noted from the Report on the implementation of the 2003 TA Plan in the first quarter of 2003 (WT/COMTD/W/112) that the central Asian region, to which the Kyrgyz Republic belonged, lagged behind other regions in terms of activities implemented. That the central Asian region was able to benefit from WTO TA at the regional level was more important than ever as other countries of the region were in the process of acceding to the WTO. The needs of the resource constrained transition economies had been clearly stated in the Doha Development Agenda. He therefore urged the Secretariat and the donors to increase their contributions to enable the countries in the central Asian region to benefit from WTO TA in 2003 and 2004. He also called on the rule setting organisations to take active part in the seminars organized by the WTO in order to increase the quality of the training provided to capital-based officials.","WTCOMTDM45.pdf","Kyrgyz, Republic, Kyrgyz, Republic, Kyrgyz, Republic, European, Union, Kyrgyz, Republic, WTO, WTO, Doha, Development, Agenda, Secretariat, WTO, WTO"
"4890",4890,"36","36.      The representative of Rwanda said that his delegation welcomed the Technical Cooperation Audit Report. The activities implemented in 2002 and planned for 2003 demonstrated a real commitment to face the challenge of capacity building. Developing countries could only integrate in the multilateral trading system through a few means such as the training of human resources, the strengthening of national institutions, and the diversification of the productive capacity through the development of the private sector. His Government appreciated the efforts made in that context, even if WTO's TA could be improved even further. His Government was satisfied with the prompt and positive reply the Secretariat had provided to the assistance requested. That proved that the restructuring of the Secretariat was a way of rationalizing the work in order to meet the set objectives. He hoped that his Government would continue to receive enhanced and more structured TA such as that provided through the IF. His delegation encouraged the Secretariat to produce regular reports showing defined objectives, indicators, resources devoted, achievements and outstanding work.","WTCOMTDM45.pdf","Rwanda, WTO, Secretariat, Secretariat, Secretariat"
"4889",4889,"35","35.    The representative of Canada said that the quantity and the value of the comments that had been made by Members on the Technical Cooperation Audit Report demonstrated the interest Members had in it. She said that her delegation also wished to highlight some of the points made in the Report. First, it was important to prioritise and establish guidelines for the selection of activities.                                                                                     WT/COMTD/M/45                                                                                            Page 11 Paragraph 13 of the Report mentioned that the WTO delivered more TA than ever. That indicated an enhanced need to prioritize. It was also important to establish objectives and indicators for each specific activity, as had been mentioned by the representative of Mauritania among others. Her delegation also agreed with the statement in paragraph 33 of the Report that it would be desirable to follow-up the training-of-trainers courses for WTO staff members. The activities undertaken also had to be planned and initiated on the basis of an assessment of the problems and needs identified by the Members, as referred to in paragraph 48 of the Report. She said that it was important to focus on the quality rather than the quantity of assistance in order to enhance the sustainability of the activities. However, she noted the comments made by the representative of the Philippines regarding the usefulness of short term activities and encouraged the Secretariat to take those comments into account, in particular when the beneficiaries were less informed and had not previously benefited from any training in a particular area. She said that her delegation also had some comments and questions with respect to issues not already mentioned. First, in view of the 2004 TA Plan, she asked if the Secretariat intended to ensure a better coordination between the needs identified by Members, whether expressed in the different WTO bodies or in the diagnostic studies undertaken within the IF, and the activities delivered. Her delegation hoped that, with the progressive implementation of the activities in 2003, the executing staff would ensure that evaluations were completed and sent to the ITTC as her delegation had understood that there had been some problems in that respect in 2002. It would also be desirable for WTO's comparative advantage to be examined before any decision was taken to implement any activity in order to ensure that the IF, the JITAP or other programmes were not better suited to implement a given activity. Finally, she requested that the raw data, on which the Report was based, be made available to Members.","WTCOMTDM45.pdf","Canada, Members, Members, WTO, Mauritania, WTO, Members, Philippines, Secretariat, Secretariat, Members, WTO, ITTC, WTO, Members"
"4888",4888,"34","34.      The representative of Morocco said that his delegation believed that the Technical Cooperation Audit Report was the best means to ameliorate TA and capacity building. Of the four pillars for the evaluation he said that he wished to refer to the issue of sustainability, which was the most difficult to evaluate. He said that his delegation wished to make a few suggestions in light of the fact that the short term courses had shown their limits. First, the duration of seminars should be prolonged in a systematic fashion. Second, the involvement of universities in developing countries should be strengthened. The regional trade policy courses organized in Africa had shown how valuable such cooperation was. The regional trade policy courses should therefore be maintained. Third, enhanced training of trainers was one the best examples of introducing sustainability of WTO TA. Fourth, the subjects of the training provided could be better targeted to each group of officials trained. Finally, he said that enhanced coordination with other organisations such as UNCTAD was desirable.","WTCOMTDM45.pdf","Morocco, Africa, WTO, UNCTAD"
"4887",4887,"33","33.      The representative of Mauritania said that his delegation appreciated the evaluation of TA activities. It was important to critically examine WTO's TA activities and identify their strengths and weaknesses in order to improve them. The current internal Technical Cooperation Audit should in the future be supplemented by an external audit. He said that he would limit his intervention to comments on the methodology and the approach. There was a problem of approach and methodology that was linked to the fact that an evaluation of WTO's TA could not be dissociated from an evaluation of public policies. It was linked to the human resources and ability of governments to define their development policies. That related to the national framework and the constraints it imposed. Second, the indicators used was another important aspect of the Technical Cooperation Audit Report. Paragraph 34 of the Report was honest in admitting that, although the indicators should be clearly stated prior to the implementation of any activity, that was rarely the case in practice. The indicators should also take such factors into account as whether the delivery of TA really improved the notification capacity of the beneficiary Government, whether the beneficiary Government was enabled to participate more actively in the negotiations, whether it was able to better integrate into the multilateral trading system and whether a beneficiary country had developed its export supply capacity. Such indicators were difficult to measure. Nevertheless, the aim should be to enlarge the scope of the Technical Cooperation Audit to consider such larger underlying questions. The WTO Technical Cooperation Audit could in the future be more focused on associating and reconciling quality and quantity of TA and, in that context, it was important to distinguish between the generic and the specific needs of beneficiary governments. The WTO Technical Cooperation Audit could also take the diversity of the current supply of products into account. In addition, it would be useful to associate the beneficiaries with the Audit to a larger extent than was currently done and to refine the methods and tools with which the evaluation was carried out.","WTCOMTDM45.pdf","Mauritania, WTO, WTO, WTO, Technical, Cooperation, Audit, WTO, Technical, Cooperation, Audit"
"4886",4886,"32","32.      The representative of Australia said that the Technical Cooperation Audit Report was an important and overall useful document. However, her delegation wished to offer some detailed comments with a view to enhancing its utility even further. She agreed with other delegations that there were issues that needed to be further explored and that WTO's resource constraints had to be taken into account. The Technical Cooperation Audit Report would have benefited from a clear statement of overall strategic purpose and objective of engaging in TA projects. A way of linking back the specific objectives for individual projects to such an overall purpose would be desirable. The information presented in the Technical Cooperation Audit Report should be made as comprehensive as possible and a clear effort had been made in that regard. Her delegation wished to see more structured and tabulated information. One example was the statement in paragraph 8 of the Report that the number of reports received in the Audit was lower than the total number of TA activities for which an evaluation was due. However, no overall quantification was available. The Technical Cooperation Audit had the capacity to provide more structured information through the use of the existing database from which data could be retrieved and analyzed. Her delegation wished to see an increase in qualitative indicators such as for example an assessment of the most commonly nominated strengths and weaknesses in project evaluations. A summary of the 15 projects subject to on-site assessment could be presented, rather than just the names of the projects. Her delegation wished to see more evidence for some of the statements made. Although there was no reason to doubt the WT/COMTD/M/45 Page 10 information provided, statements such as ""Teaching skills of TA providers have certainly been enhanced through participation in the training-of-trainers courses..."" in paragraph 19 could be further elaborated. Another concern of her delegation related to the lack of reporting on collaborative projects with other organizations. That issue should also be considered in the context of outsourcing. The reporting of the external evaluations should be as extensive as possible. She suggested that summaries of those evaluations might be provided. The four principles of evaluation used by the Technical Cooperation Audit were sound. The approach of universal self-evaluation followed by a resource-constrained sample of independent evaluations was reasonable. However, that methodology could be improved. Generally improving the design and evaluation of individual projects had been identified as an area requiring further work. Her delegation believed that that work should be prioritized.","WTCOMTDM45.pdf","Australia, WTO, Technical, Cooperation, Audit"
"4885",4885,"31","31.      The representative of the Philippines said that the Technical Cooperation Audit was an important function that Members had to consider in light of the scare resources available in the technical cooperation budget. Her delegation welcomed that the report of the Technical Cooperation Audit was detailed. The Technical Cooperation Audit Report pointed out areas that needed improvement. She said that she wished to assure the donors that the participants to the short and long term TA activities had benefited from and appreciated the TA provided. There would always be a trade-off between quality and quantity. Speaking about the experience of her Government she said that not all ministries in the Philippines were fully aware of what the WTO was. The short-term courses and information seminars clearly served the purpose of increasing awareness of various Government officials about the WTO Agreements and its implications to national government policies. While the long term trade policy courses were useful, it was always difficult to release staff for a long time. Her Government was still awaiting the implementation of a few national short term courses it had identified. She agreed with the report that the effectiveness of the regional courses was unknown although she realized that courses were being carried out at the regional level in an attempt to maximize the use of the limited resources. Her delegation agreed with the evaluation approach based on the four pillars, i.e. efficiency, effectiveness, relevance and sustainability. In terms of efficiency she said that the Philippine participants in WTO TA activities had all commended the WTO lecturers for their efficiency. Effectiveness was difficult to measure. It depended to a large extent on the person participating in an activity. The content of the activities in which Philippine officials had participated had been relevant. She said that sustainability was an area that she believed could be improved. She said that she agreed with what had been said by other delegations that the donors, beneficiaries and the Secretariat had to work together to ensure that the delivery of WTO TA became more effective for all beneficiaries.","WTCOMTDM45.pdf","Philippines, Members, Philippines, WTO, WTO, WTO, WTO, Secretariat, WTO"
"4884",4884,"30","30.     The Secretariat said that it wished to respond to the question posed by the representative of the European Communities regarding the Secretariat's plans for the Technical Cooperation Audit. The Training Institute had been merged with the Technical Cooperation Division and Mr. Paul Rolian had been assigned the directorship of the new Institute for Training and Technical Cooperation (ITTC). The Technical Cooperation Audit was currently staffed on a temporary basis and the Secretariat was in the process of identifying a new director for it. The Secretariat had wished to strengthen the Technical Cooperation Audit. However, Members had not approved the necessary additional staff resources for 2003. The six additional posts received had been needed in the                                                                                    WT/COMTD/M/45                                                                                            Page 9 operational divisions because of the ongoing negotiations. Nevertheless, he was hopeful that additional resources could be allocated to the Technical Cooperation Audit in the future. Informal discussions were undertaken with donors in the search for a solution to the issue. Mr. Paul Rolian had moved, with his post, to the ITTC so there was unfortunately no empty post in the Technical Cooperation Audit. That made it difficult for the Secretariat to find a solution to the directorship of the Technical Cooperation Audit. However, the Secretariat considered the directorship of the Technical Cooperation Audit to be an important position and a director would soon be nominated. Some further restructuring of the Secretariat might also take place because of retirements. He concluded by saying that he considered the Technical Cooperation Audit to be playing the role it was intended to play.","WTCOMTDM45.pdf","Secretariat, Secretariat, Technical, Cooperation, Audit, Training, Institute, Technical, Cooperation, Division, Paul, Rolian, Institute, for, Training, and, Technical, Cooperation, Secretariat, Secretariat, Members, Technical, Cooperation, Audit, Paul, Rolian, ITTC, Secretariat, Secretariat, Secretariat"

The Chairman said that, at the last meeting of the Committee, Members had agreed to revert to the election of the Chairperson of the Committee on Trade and Development (CTD) at the beginning of the 45th Session. He said that, as had been mentioned at the meeting of the General Council on 15 May 2003, the informal consultations that he had undertaken on behalf of the Chairman of the General Council had led him to believe that there was consensus for the Committee to elect Ambassador Habib Mansour of Tunisia as the next Chairperson of the CTD in Regular and Dedicated Sessions.","WTCOMTDM45.pdf","Chairman, Committee, Members, Chairperson, Committee, on, Trade, and, Development, General, Council, Chairman, General, Council, Committee, Ambassador, Habib, Mansour, Tunisia, Chairperson, CTD"
"4882",4882,"29","29.      He went on to say that he appreciated the comments made with respect to relevance. The activities carried out had been relevant and focussed. The Technical Cooperation Audit Report mentioned that there was a link between relevance and sustainability of TA activities. Sustainability was not only about ensuring that TA was provided. It was also related to the long-term impact of the TA delivered. The long-term sustainability of TA activities required additional efforts. The ability of the people trained to transmit their knowledge to others had to be part of the goal of long term sustainability. The part of the Technical Cooperation Audit Report containing lessons learned was good. TA delivery was not only a question of quantity but rather a question of quality. Quality and excellence was a continuum and the Technical Cooperation Audit Report was an important tool in ensuring a high quality of the TA delivered. He suggested that the Technical Cooperation Audit Report remain an integral feature of WTO TA.","WTCOMTDM45.pdf","WTO"
"4881",4881,"28","28.      The representative of Mauritius said that the Technical Cooperation Audit Report came at an opportune time about midway in the work of the Doha Development Agenda. It was useful to stop and consider what had been done and that was exactly what the Technical Cooperation Audit Report did. The approach taken by the Technical Cooperation Audit in its report was commendable. That was true for its coverage, both country and substance-wise. The kind of cross-sectional approach taken was plausible as it covered a number of countries and regions. His Government had been happy to receive the former head of the WTO Technical Cooperation Audit in Mauritius while he was undertaking part of the 2002 Audit. His delegation believed that the Technical Cooperation Audit Report comprehensively covered the evaluation approach based on the four pillars of efficiency, effectiveness, relevance and sustainability. Most activities had been delivered in the area of services. That was logical as the services sector was poised to play an ever increasing role in the economies of developing countries. He suggested that that momentum be kept and even that the TA related to the services sector be given more attention in the future. The evaluation made by the Chairperson of the Special Session of the Council for Trade in Services had shown that the number of requests and offers made by Members in the area of services was limited. Developing country Members needed assistance to evaluate the existing offers and proceed to submit offers themselves. The successes and shortcomings in terms of the efficiency of the TA delivered was a shared responsibility of the beneficiaries, the donors and the Secretariat. There had been some problems with developing country participants who had not been able to dedicate themselves fully to participate in the activities. That message had to go back to developing country Governments. Participants had to be able to devote themselves to participate fully in any activity proposed so that the most was made of the opportunities presented by WTO TA. On the other hand, there had also been problems of interpretation. Participants had not been able to take full advantage of activities delivered in languages they were not fluent in. That was something that needed to be rectified as soon as possible. Interpretation was important and unless participants were given the opportunity to fully understand the content of the courses it would be difficult for them to absorb the information.","WTCOMTDM45.pdf","Mauritius, Doha, Development, Agenda, Technical, Cooperation, Audit, WTO, Technical, Cooperation, Audit, Mauritius, Chairperson, Council, for, Trade, in, Services, Members, Members, Secretariat, WTO"
"4880",4880,"27","27.     The representative of the European Communities said that he agreed with much of what the three previous speakers had said with respect to the Technical Cooperation Audit Report. His delegation appreciated the positive nature of the overall evaluation exercise and recognized that it was a new tool that had been introduced in 2002. As the Secretariat itself had stated, it could and should be improved in future years as experience in its application was gained. The evaluation process would assist Members ensure continued quality improvement of WTO TA activities and their sustainability. That should lead to a higher proportion of planned and structured activities rather than ad hoc and small scale activities. The lessons that could be learned from what had been done in 2002 should be applied in the design of the activities for 2003 and when monitoring and evaluating them. His delegation was interested in exploring the idea suggested by the Secretariat in the Technical Cooperation Audit Report for a multi-annual perspective to planning. The representative of Norway had mentioned that that might have budgetary implications. However, his delegation believed that longer term planning had the potential to ensure that Members were working on a more structured and sustainable basis in the design and delivery of activities. Another point suggested by the Secretariat, but which his delegation was less enthusiastic about, was the idea of WTO field presence. His WT/COMTD/M/45 Page 8 delegation saw the role of the WTO as being the quality controller from the centre, delivering a relatively limited number of activities in areas where it was the undeniable specialist and ensuring the quality of other activities relating to the WTO carried out by regional partners. Finally, he asked how the Secretariat intended to organize the evaluation of the activities carried out in 2003 and beyond, in light of the reorganization of the Secretariat.","WTCOMTDM45.pdf","European, Communities, Secretariat, Members, WTO, Secretariat, Norway, Members, Secretariat, WTO, WTO, WTO, Secretariat, Secretariat"
"4879",4879,"26","26.      The representative of Norway said that the Technical Cooperation Audit Report was a valuable document which did not only describe the activities implemented in 2002 but also referred to improvements that could be made in the evaluation work itself. Her delegation expected that action would be taken according to those recommendations. One such recommendation was that the evaluation should include all activities and that the evaluation feed-back mechanism should be improved. Members had received the Technical Cooperation Audit Report in the first quarter of 2003 as promised. However, her delegation recommended that the discussion of the report be held in the first quarter of the year in the future, or as quickly as possible after the circulation of the document. The reason was that her delegation believed that the Technical Cooperation Audit Report could be a useful tool for Member Governments whose budgetary processes for coming years included reporting on how the budgetary means had been used and the effects of the activities in the preceding years. Her Government had used the 2002 Technical Cooperation Audit Report in the preparation of its 2004 budget. However, her Government would have preferred that the Technical Cooperation Audit Report had first been considered by the CTD. Her delegation had, on several occasions, raised the question of making all WTO TA activities part of the regular budget. In that context she referred to paragraph 21 in the Technical Cooperation Audit Report which stated that ""The plan lives and dies from one year to the next. Therefore, the cumulative benefits of the current TAs for the beneficiaries are more the result of coincidence than systematically thought out efforts."" That should provide food for thought. The WTO/OECD Doha Development Agenda Trade Capacity Building Database aimed at increasing coordination among donors. However, Members also had to consider better coordinated TA in a longer time perspective. That was also true for the work carried out by the WTO Secretariat.","WTCOMTDM45.pdf","Norway, Members, Member, CTD, WTO, Technical, Cooperation, Audit, Report, Members, WTO, Secretariat"
"4878",4878,"25","25.     The representative of Switzerland said that his delegation appreciated the Technical Cooperation Audit Report as it was concise and contained good recommendations. Several of those recommendations were common sense recommendations, but it was important to consider how they could be implemented. The Technical Cooperation Audit Report confirmed what his delegation had expressed since 2002, namely that the emphasis should be on better structured long-term programmes rather than short workshops and ad hoc activities. His delegation wished to see the design of multi-year programmes for specific sectors, countries or regions for Members to approve. Such programmes had to stay within the specific functions of the WTO which were to assist Member Governments interpret the WTO framework and better manage the rules. A possible risk was that multi-year programmes of TA would expand into intensive capacity building and institutional development programmes. Those tasks however had to be dealt with elsewhere, such as in the context of the IF or JITAP. Of the practical recommendations contained in the Technical Cooperation Audit Report, he recalled that the needs-assessments had to be done more carefully, using all available                                                                                     WT/COMTD/M/45                                                                                             Page 7 resources including WTO staff, other delegations and Trade Policy Reviews. The definition of needs should not rely exclusively on questionnaires and affirmed needs by governments. It was also important to set clear objectives and benchmarks for any training to be delivered, even if those objectives and benchmarks were limited. It would otherwise be impossible to evaluate the programmes. Work was also needed to standardize training tools and time and resources had to be invested in the selection of staff and consultants as trainers. The delivery of TA was a complex task and a quality culture of TA had to emerge at the WTO, which was not primarily a technical cooperation delivery organization. The present system of basing the Technical Cooperation Audit Reports on self-evaluation was the best that could be done. However, his delegation wished the Technical Cooperation Audit to carry out more direct interventions. He said that he was surprised that only 15 out of 481 had been directly evaluated by the Technical Cooperation Audit. That number had to increase. His delegation favoured a stronger technical cooperation evaluation unit with the ability to carry out more comprehensive tasks. The WTO should in the longer-term become the centre for knowledge and quality control of TRTA rather than actually delivering direct TA. The WTO could, in the future, evaluate the TRTA activities carried out by other institutions.","WTCOMTDM45.pdf","Switzerland, Members, WTO, Member, WTO, WTO, WTO, Technical, Cooperation, Audit, WTO, WTO"
"4877",4877,"24","24.     The representative of the United States said that the Technical Cooperation Audit had made a good start in reviewing the activities carried out in 2002. The fact that 481 activities had been implemented indicated that the WTO was strongly committed to trade capacity building. It was an outstanding achievement in light of the number of activities implemented in 2001. Nevertheless, her delegation agreed with the report that there should be less emphasis on the quantity of activities and more on their quality. She said that she was comfortable with the idea discussed in informal sessions of aiming for more sustainable TA activities. That could be achieved by targeted programmes which clearly addressed the needs of developing countries. The emphasis on the number of projects implemented could detract from the ability to deliver quality projects. Her delegation welcomed that the Technical Cooperation Audit helped Members consider those issues. Her delegation also agreed with the Technical Cooperation Audit that the higher quality programmes involved larger and longer term initiatives than the short term, small scale activities on which WTO Members had tended to focus in the last couple of years. It was important to ensure that participants in past projects could build upon the knowledge they had gained to move forward. Consistent with the Technical Cooperation Audit, her delegation recognized that the evaluation of activities carried out was an important part of Members' work. That evaluation had to be an ongoing exercise of which the current audit was a beginning. However, her delegation wished to see the Technical Cooperation Audit improved in the future. Her delegation was willing to work with the Secretariat to explore other approaches to evaluation. It was clear that resources were needed to carry out evaluations and that there was a tension between the attempt to focus on the programming, administration and management and future planning. Her delegation wished to be actively engaged in the Technical Cooperation Audit by considering how to improve it, possibly by engaging an independent audit, and considering how to get resources for it.","WTCOMTDM45.pdf","United, States, Technical, Cooperation, Audit, WTO, Members, WTO, Members, Members, Technical, Cooperation, Audit, Secretariat"

The report, which had been distributed to Members at the end of March, contained an analysis of WTO's TA in 2002 and represented the Technical Cooperation Audit's mandatory annual evaluation to the Committee. He said that the report focused its analysis on the performance of WTO's TA activities from the point of view of their efficiency, effectiveness, relevance and sustainability. In response to the November 2002 debate in the Committee, it also put forward findings, observations and comments on the TA planning process and suggested improvements both in terms of planning and implementation.

The ITC had strengthened its activities within that framework and had also created new activities. The ITC had managed its limited resources well and all the donors had recognised that. His delegation requested the ITC to strengthen its activities for the private sector in developing countries through electronic commerce and by enhancing their export capacity. The Government of Morocco and the ITC had hosted a number of joint activities such as the second ""Meet in Africa"" trade in leather exhibition in Casablanca in 2000 and the 3rd World Conference of Trade Promotion Organisations in Marrakech in 2000. The Government of Morocco would also be hosting the South-South Trade Promotion Conference in December 2003 and counted on the full involvement of the ITC.","WTCOMTDM45.pdf","Morocco, Director, ITC, ITC, ITC, ITC, ITC, Morocco, ITC, Africa, Casablanca, World, Conference, of, Trade, Promotion, Organisations, Marrakech, Morocco, South-South, Trade, Promotion, Conference, ITC"

He therefore welcomed the recent formal arrangements between those three organizations. His delegation congratulated the ITC for its focused activities and innovative approaches. The ITC had worked with its members to raise the number of activities by about 20 per cent. That was a respectful percentage and the increase in ITC's activities was welcome. His delegation also welcomed the proposal by the delegation of Denmark to evaluate the ITC. He said that his delegation wished to be part of the core group as well as the broader consultation group for that evaluation.

He only wished to recognize that the ITC remained true to its vocation and that with scarce resources it made major efforts to support development through various programmes. ITC's work in 2002, as summed-up in the Annual Report,                                                                                     WT/COMTD/M/45                                                                                             Page 5 demonstrated its commitment to the goal of sustainable development. In particular, the intensified support for the relationship between trade and development, implemented through the new programme for poverty reduction through exports, the successful completion of the first phase of the JITAP and the intention to proceed to a second stage of the programme, the launching of activities in the context of the programme to promote South-South trade, and the use of ITC's set of competition tools were praiseworthy. In Cuba, the ITC had provided support in the field of information, capacity building and advisory services, in particular to the Centre for Export Promotion, as well as by participating in Cuba's main trade fair in the previous year. His delegation therefore congratulated the ITC and invited it to continue to work in the same spirit in order to come up with the solutions developing countries required.","WTCOMTDM45.pdf","Cuba, ITC, ITC, ITC, Cuba, ITC, Cuba, ITC"

Second, the priority accorded to projects in developing countries and least-developed countries (LDCs) to strengthen their export diversification capacity and to promote their products in different world markets through the important tools developed by the ITC. That had also been done through innovative programmes such as the Integrated Framework (IF), the JITAP and the World Trade Net. Both the beneficiaries and the donors had confidence in the ITC.

The Chairman said that, as had been agreed when the Agenda was adopted, he would take up the issue of updating the Committee's Annual Report to the General Council under ""Other Business"". Members would recall that the General Council, at its meeting on 10 February 2003, had addressed the issue of the preparation of the annual report that the General Council was to submit to the Cancún Ministerial Conference. It had been then agreed that the General Council would submit to the Ministerial Conference a brief update to its annual report for 2002 which would describe developments since December 2002. He clarified that that only referred to the routine annual reports of a factual nature that all WTO bodies were required to make under existing procedures, and not any specific reports that Ministers at the Doha Ministerial Conference had requested be submitted to them. The intention was that the Ministerial Conference would have before it, as the annual report of the General Council, a compilation of the 2002 Annual Reports of all the WTO bodies, together with updated reports concerning developments in 2003. He therefore suggested that the Committee ask the Secretariat to update the CTD's Annual Report for 2002, so that it covered the work of the Committee since the 2002 report. He further suggested that the Committee adopt that report on a non-objection basis, namely that Members would have five days to comment on the draft report once the Secretariat had made it available to them, and that, if there were no major substantive comments, it be forwarded to the General Council.","WTCOMTDM45.pdf","Chairman, Committee, General, Council, Members, General, Council, General, Council, Cancún, Ministerial, Conference, General, Council, WTO, General, Council, WTO, Committee, Secretariat, CTD, Committee, Committee, Members, Secretariat, General, Council"

He reminded Members that paragraph 34 of the Doha Ministerial Declaration instructed the General Council to consider the most appropriate institutional arrangements for handling the Work Programme on Electronic Commerce and to report on further progress to the Fifth Session of the Ministerial Conference. Pursuant to that, the General Council had agreed, at its meeting in October 2002, to maintain the current institutional arrangements for handling the Work Programme on Electronic Commerce, namely that the Council for Trade in Services, the Council for Trade in Goods, the TRIPS Council and the CTD examine and report on aspects of e-commerce relevant to their respective areas of competence. He suggested that the Secretariat be asked to draft a brief factual report summarizing the Committee's work on e-commerce since the Doha Ministerial Conference including references to the relevant parts of the reports of the meetings at which the issue was discussed and that the Committee adopt that report on a non-objection basis. He said that Members would have five days to forward their comments to the Secretariat after they had received the draft.

That event would give African representatives from the Government, the private sector, the civil society, regional, international, as well as non-governmental organisations the opportunity to discuss different aspects of new technologies and e-commerce and would contribute to define a programme of action to apply new technologies to ensure sustainable development. That Conference would also deal with the role of e-commerce in Africa and how to draw up policies and strategies for the enhanced contribution of e-commerce to regional integration and development. A draft declaration was being finalised by the African Group at UNCTAD. That declaration would constitute the basis for a plan of action to improve African countries' access to information and communication technology infrastructure within the framework of the preparations for the World Summit on the Information Society which would be held in two phases.

The Chairman said that, at the last meeting, the Committee had had before it document WT/COMTD/W/110 containing a description of the work that had been carried out on electronic commerce (e-commerce) in the CTD. That document showed that the CTD had been active in the area of e-commerce and had carried out an extensive educational process on issues relating to e- commerce and development. However, Members had not made any specific suggestions on how to build on that work. That might have been the result of Members being busy with preparations for the Fifth Ministerial Conference in Cancún. He invited Members to make suggestions on how the CTD could carry forward its work on e-commerce. He said that e-commerce referred to the practical application of new technologies in the area of information and communication and that it was important to ensure that activities being carried out in the international community reverberated in the discussions on e-commerce in the CTD. He made reference to the World Summit on the Information Society, the first phase of which would be held in Geneva in December 2003, and the second phase of which would be held in Tunisia in November 2005. He said that new information and communication technologies might constitute a solution to narrowing the digital and social divide between the North and the South. Such Summits should also seek to ensure that new information and communication technology worked for the benefit of trade and development by ensuring that a practical application in trade could contribute to sustainable development.","WTCOMTDM45.pdf","Chairman, Committee, CTD, CTD, Members, Members, Cancún, Members, CTD, CTD, Information, Society, Geneva, Tunisia, South"

He said that agriculture was the cornerstone for the stability and social cohesion of some countries which were heavily dependent on agriculture. Although the issue of agriculture was dealt with in other WTO bodies, it was important for the CTD to keep its course set on the developmental aspects of agriculture. That should motivate developed and developing country Members to consider how to enhance the integration of developing countries into the multilateral trading system and to find solutions to the challenges in the area of agriculture. He said that if Members agreed, the Committee would continue to consider the mandate given in paragraph 51 of the Doha Ministerial Declaration at future meetings. He said that Tunisia was a country where the agricultural dimension was fundamental. The Governments of Tunisia and the European Communities had a special partnership in which agricultural was an important component. He reiterated the importance of agriculture for both Member countries in the North and in the South. He said that he had intended to invite Members to make proposals on how the agenda item on sustainable development could be dealt with and asked if the Committee could agree to the suggestion by the representative of the European Communities, that the next presentation relating to paragraph 51 of the Doha Ministerial Declaration relate to the developmental aspects of the negotiations on non- agricultural market access.","WTCOMTDM45.pdf","Chairman, WTO, CTD, Members, Members, Committee, Tunisia, Tunisia, European, Communities, Member, North, South, Members, Committee, European, Communities"

The Secretariat said that the point it had attempted to make in the paper when referring to the time horizon was that protection could possibly have short term benefits but that there were long term costs with protection.

With respect to the erosion of preferences, he said that the paper stated that some of the defensive positions taken by developing countries with respect to market access were the function of the time horizon. However, his understanding was that developing country Members' views on the issue of market access depended on more than just the question of timing. His delegation had proposed a number of measures in favour of developing countries' access to developed country markets. His delegation believed that, a commitment should be made by developed countries at the Fifth Ministerial Conference to provide duty free and quota free access for all imports from LDCs. Developed countries needed to ensure zero duty access for developing country exports for no less that 50 per cent of developed country imports. His delegation had also put forward a proposal to reduce tariff escalation on products of particular interest to developing countries. With respect to the defensive interest of developing countries towards market access, his delegation believed that the modalities should allow developing countries to assume lower reduction commitments and longer implementation periods to facilitate the implementation of those commitments. He said that the question of excessive rates of inflation needed to be addressed in the negotiations on agriculture to avoid economies with excessive inflation rates from suffering. Increased TA was also needed to provide sustainable economic development. His delegation was in favour of a certain degree of flexibility in relation to domestic support measures, the de minimis clause and was also in favour of a safeguard instrument that would protect key food security crops in developing countries. His delegation believed that those proposals should be included in the modalities on agriculture as they addressed the general goal of the development agenda.","WTCOMTDM45.pdf","European, Communities, Secretariat, Members, Committee, Secretariat, Members"
"4854",4854,"13","13.     Mr. Ismail, JAG, Chairman said that the JAG had held its Thirty-sixth Session from 28 April to 2 May 2003. In their opening remarks to the JAG, both the Secretary General of UNCTAD and the Deputy Director-General of the WTO had commended ITC on its performance in 2002 and had congratulated the ITC Executive Director on his reappointment for another term. They had noted that the collaboration amongst the three organizations had continued to thrive and that the ITC had an increasingly important contribution to make to supporting development through trade. In his statement to the Group, the Executive Director had highlighted ITC's achievements in 2002 and had spoken of his vision for ITC's future development. The year 2002 had been a good one and ITC's performance was largely due to the positive response of its donors and to the enthusiasm of its staff. It intended to build on the year's achievements to assert its relevance, to continue the process of change, and to grow as a niche player in trade-related technical assistance (TRTA). The plan for growth rested on three principles: the first was for ITC to remain focused and to continue to do what WT/COMTD/M/45 Page 4 it did best; the second was to continue to innovate in technical assistance (TA) approaches and programmes; and the third was to work towards greater field-level impact. ITC had matured into a lean and confident organisation on the eve of its 40th anniversary in 2004. The JAG had reviewed the Annual Report on ITC's activities in 2002 and the report of the Consultative Committee on the ITC Global Trust Fund. The Group congratulated ITC on a productive year and on the quality of the documentation before it. The relevance of ITC's overall approach to TRTA and the Executive Director's strategy for growth had been acknowledged and the ITC had been encouraged to continue its efforts to strengthen the trade and development relationship. The JAG had highlighted the importance of TRTA to the integration of developing and transition economies into the multilateral trading system in the context of the Doha Development Agenda. Representatives had underscored the importance of UNCTAD, WTO and ITC continuing to work together to ensure a coherent and comprehensive approach and the Joint Integrated Technical Assistance Programme to Selected Least- Developed and Other African Countries (JITAP) was cited as a model of effective institutional collaboration and efficient field delivery. Another subject discussed under other business at the JAG Session was the proposal by the delegation of Denmark, for an independent, external evaluation of ITC. The purpose of such an evaluation would be to determine how ITC's role in TRTA could be enhanced. The JAG had agreed that a core group, composed of a small number of donors and beneficiaries, would define the needs and relevance of such an evaluation, determine its scope, clarify the processes and its management, decide on a time frame and agree on the output of the exercise and on what would happen once the report was issued. That core group would liaise on an ongoing basis with a broader consultation group. All interested stakeholders should contact the delegation of Denmark with respect to participation in the evaluation exercise. Before concluding, he also mentioned that, at the Thirty-sixth Session of the JAG, as was the practice each year, government representatives had announced, confirmed or indicated possible voluntary contributions to ITC. In that context and on behalf of the JAG, he said that he wished to express thanks to the Governments of Canada, Denmark, Finland, France, India, Ireland, Italy, Netherlands, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland, United Kingdom, and the United States. He said that his oral report covered the main issues discussed during the Thirty-sixth JAG Session and that he, and the Executive Director of the ITC, were happy to respond to any questions from Members.","WTCOMTDM45.pdf","Ismail, JAG, Chairman, UNCTAD, Director-General, WTO, ITC, ITC, Director, ITC, Group, Director, ITC, ITC, ITC, ITC, TA, ITC, ITC, Consultative, Committee, ITC, Global, Trust, Fund, Group, ITC, ITC, TRTA, Director, ITC, TRTA, Doha, Development, Agenda, UNCTAD, WTO, ITC, Joint, Integrated, Technical, Assistance, Programme, Denmark, ITC, ITC, Denmark, ITC, Canada, Denmark, Finland, France, India, Ireland, Italy, Netherlands, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland, United, Kingdom, United, States, Director, ITC, Members"

There was no doubt that the agricultural negotiations needed to rectify the current imbalances of the existing Agreement on Agriculture. The Uruguay Round had allowed developed country Members to protect their rich farmers from the impact of trade liberalisation whilst at the same time poor farmers in developing countries were left to fend for themselves with the increasing pressure of trade liberalisation. Contrary to the farmers in the OECD countries who received billions of US dollars in support, Indonesian farmers, who received minimal or no domestic support, were only protected from the influx of artificially cheap agricultural products by an average tariff rate of 8.4 per cent. He said that he agreed with the representative of India that the objective of any agreed modalities on agriculture should include a commitment to fundamental reform of domestic support and export subsidies by those Members that were responsible for those distortions. During discussions in the Special Session of the Committee on Agriculture, his delegation had reiterated the importance of ensuring that reform resulted in fair agricultural trade from which developing countries could reap the benefits. Developing countries were fully committed to agricultural trade reform as stipulated in Article 20 of the Agreement on Agriculture. However, that reform process needed to ensure fair agricultural trade which meant that the concerns of developing countries, particularly food security, growth, development and other S&D provisions had to be taken into account.","WTCOMTDM45.pdf","Indonesia, Secretariat, Members, Uruguay, Round, Members, OECD, India, Members, Committee, on, Agriculture"
"4851",4851,"127","127.     The representative of India thanked the Secretariat for its presentation but said that his delegation had its own views on how development issues were being dealt with in the Committee on Agriculture. However, that was something that his delegation had taken up in that forum. He said that the Secretariat's observation with respect to developing country Members' reticence to open up their own markets was factually correct. However, a complete picture was necessary in order to understand why developing countries were so reluctant towards the question of market access. President Blaise Compaore of Burkina Faso had explained, at the meeting of the WTO Trade Negotiations Committee on 10 June 2003, the problems faced by some countries due to the subsidies provided by one major producer for one product and how those subsidies distorted prices on the world market. The reason why developing countries were reluctant to open up their markets was that the market for agricultural products was distorted. He said that more than US $300 billion worth of subsidies provided by the OECD countries for agricultural products were a major cause for the distortion in agricultural trade. Developing countries could not be expected to liberalise their agricultural markets unless that problem was satisfactorily addressed.","WTCOMTDM45.pdf","India, Secretariat, Committee, on, Agriculture, Secretariat, Members, Blaise, Compaore, Burkina, Faso, WTO, Trade, Negotiations, Committee, US, OECD"
"4850",4850,"126","126.     He went on to say that the issue of S&D was undisputed, however there was a wide divergence of positions regarding the type of S&D to be provided. In addition to the traditional S&D in the form of lower reduction rates and longer implementation periods, developing country Members were seeking enhanced S&D, particularly in the areas of domestic support and market access. The modality paper by the Chairman of the Committee on Agriculture contained a number of ideas in that regard, for instance, the concept of special products. He said that the effectiveness of the instruments contained in the Marrakesh Decision on Net Food-Importing Developing Countries was an important implementation matter related to the Agreement on Agriculture. The main concern was that LDCs and Net Food-Importing Developing Countries (NFIDCs) had faced and could face in the future, WT/COMTD/M/45 Page 34 higher food import bills as a result of export subsidy reductions. Various proposals had been made to establish a revolving fund to cushion the impact of price shocks but those proposals had so far failed to convince the donor community. Discussions on how to improve the effectiveness of the Marrakesh Decision were ongoing. He said that, at the General Council meeting on Coherence on 13 May 2003, Horst Köhler, Managing Director of the IMF had confirmed that the IMF would consider the concerns of the NFIDCs and LDCs when reviewing the Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility and the Compensatory Finance Facility during that year.","WTCOMTDM45.pdf","Members, Chairman, Committee, on, Agriculture, Marrakesh, General, Council, Horst, Köhler, Director, IMF, IMF, NFIDCs, LDCs, Compensatory, Finance, Facility"
"4849",4849,"125","125.     The Secretariat said that its presentation would summarize the main points in the paper which had been made available to Members. He said that a lot was at stake in the agriculture negotiations, since agriculture in many cases was the backbone of developing country economies. It was therefore not surprising that most, if not all, issues discussed in the agricultural negotiations had a development orientation. One key development issue was the depth of further commitments by developed country Members in the areas of export subsidies and trade-distorting domestic support. Developing country Members were united in demanding that and were clear about what they expected. Core negotiating objectives for developing country Members were large reductions of trade-distorting domestic support and the elimination of export subsidies. That was a precondition for many developing country Members to add momentum to the negotiations on market access. Another developing country concern related to a trend, mainly by developed countries, to switch support from one product to another or from one subsidy category to another, without any tangible liberalizing effect. He said that a number of proposals had been tabled in the Committee on Agriculture, including the Chairman's first draft on modalities, on how to restrict that flexibility. Regarding the issue of market access, he said that most developing countries were in favour of significant improvements in the access to the markets of developed countries. However, when it came to their own participation in the process of reducing protection, developing country Members' interests differed. That was due to a variety of reasons which depended on how they perceived the short-term competitiveness of their agricultural sector as well as how they believed it would evolve in the long run.","WTCOMTDM45.pdf","Secretariat, Members, Members, Members, Members, Members, Committee, on, Agriculture, Chairman, Members"

He noted that the issue under discussion was a broader systemic issue as the agenda item was called ""Notification procedures for regional trade agreements among developing countries"". His delegation therefore felt that it was inappropriate to refer to any particular RTA under that agenda item and would have difficulty with such an approach.","WTCOMTDM45.pdf","India, United, States, India, Sri, Lanka, RTA"

The report on that meeting was contained in ITC document ITC/AG/(XXXVI)/195 of 15 May 2003.

The representative of Sri Lanka said that the note by the Secretariat had only recently been circulated and his delegation might comment on it at a later occasion, specifically on the concluding paragraphs. With regard to the question raised by the representative of the United States on the FTA between Sri Lanka and India, he recalled that that issue had been discussed and dealt with in detail at previous sessions of the CTD and had been duly notified keeping with Members' obligations. His delegation therefore was of the view that there was no need for the CTD to take up that issue again as his delegation had fulfilled its obligations.","WTCOMTDM45.pdf","Sri, Lanka, Secretariat, United, States, FTA, Sri, Lanka, India, CTD, Members, CTD"
"4841",4841,"118","118.    The representative of the European Communities said that, on a first reading, his delegation was attracted by the analysis which was close to its own. He said that the Secretariat note was a good point of reference for the Committee's discussion on the question of procedures to follow with respect to RTAs between developing countries. He agreed with the essence of the Secretariat's analysis that the CRTA was empowered by Members to undertake examinations of agreements between developing countries if it was asked to do so by the CTD, and in line with the relevant legal provisions. His delegation was also conscious that the mandate of the Negotiating Group on Rules potentially included that area of work. The document was therefore potentially relevant in that context as well.","WTCOMTDM45.pdf","European, Communities, Secretariat, Committee, Secretariat, CRTA, Members, CTD"
"4840",4840,"117","117.   The representative of the United States said that his delegation hoped that the Secretariat note would serve as a focus for the Committee's discussion on notifications and reviews of RTAs under the         4             WT/COMTD/M/44 WT/COMTD/M/45 Page 32 Enabling Clause. His delegation joined other delegations and the Secretariat in recognizing the need for all RTAs among all developing countries to be notified to the WTO for a review of such RTAs to be conducted. He encouraged Members to consider how the CTD could cooperate with the CRTA to conduct such reviews. He noted that the question of the relationship between GATT Article XXIV and the Enabling Clause was an issue where there were different views among Members and which was part of an ongoing dialogue in the Negotiating Group on Rules. In that sense, he said that his delegation supported the proposal made by the delegations of Switzerland and Canada to refer the document to the Negotiating Group on Rules for consideration there. However, such a decision might procedurally best be taken in response to a request from the Negotiating Group on Rules. He said that he had one technical point and a follow-up question with respect to the Secretariat note. He agreed with paragraph 4 of the Secretariat's legal analysis that the Enabling Clause applied only to agreements for trade in goods. Further, as noted in paragraph 6 of legal note, the Enabling Clause applied only to regional or global arrangements amongst less-developed countries for mutual reduction or elimination of tariffs and non-tariff measures, on products imported from each other. The Enabling Clause thus only provided special and differential treatment with respect to the internal aspects of the RTA between the parties. He said that his delegation was less certain that it applied to the external aspects of the RTA that affected imports from third parties. Included among such external aspects were the application of a common external tariff or common regulations of commerce that would resolve from a formation of a customs union. He asked what the Secretariat saw as notification requirements that would be applicable to those other external aspects of an agreement that would satisfy the internal aspect with respect to the Enabling Clause, but fall outside its scope with respect to those other matters. Lastly, he said that his delegation had submitted questions to the delegations of India and Sri Lanka, as it had indicated that it would. His delegation looked forward to receiving a formal answer to those questions on the RTA between India and Sri Lanka in the near future.","WTCOMTDM45.pdf","United, States, Secretariat, Committee, Secretariat, WTO, Members, CTD, CRTA, GATT, Members, Switzerland, Canada, Secretariat, Secretariat, RTA, RTA, Secretariat, India, Sri, Lanka, RTA, India, Sri, Lanka"
"4839",4839,"116","116.     He continued by saying that his delegation believed that the existing procedures with respect to notifications of RTAs under the Enabling Clause were sufficient. There was no need to add new obligations in terms of notification procedures or any review or examination in any other WTO body. He further said that paragraph 60 of the note by the Secretariat stated that ""...it might be institutionally more efficient and legally more coherent for the CRTA to conduct the primary examination of all RTAs, without impairing Members' rights and obligations."" That conclusion went beyond the mandate Members had given the Secretariat in requesting the factual Secretariat note as it prejudged the positions held by Members. There were different views on how to deal with RTAs notified under the Enabling Clause. His delegation was of the view that there was no requirement for any sort of examination of RTAs notified under the Enabling Clause. It was therefore inappropriate to draw such conclusions as those in the note by the Secretariat. He finally said that his delegation had reservations regarding the suggestion made by the delegation of Canada to send the Secretariat note to the Negotiating Group on Rules.","WTCOMTDM45.pdf","WTO, Secretariat, CRTA, Members, Members, Secretariat, Secretariat, Members, Secretariat, Canada, Secretariat"
"4838",4838,"115","115.     The representative of India said that the Secretariat note had examined the issue of procedures for the notification of RTAs entered into under the Enabling Clause. It appeared to his delegation that the Secretariat thus had examined the issue relating to RTAs under Enabling Clause on a wider canvass than agreed to when the matter was discussed at the last meeting of the CTD. It was his delegation's understanding that the mandate given had been somewhat narrower. He emphasized that the Secretariat note had been prepared on the Secretariat's own responsibility and without prejudice to the positions of Members and their rights and obligations under the WTO. He said that he was not certain about the status of the legal note by the Secretariat. Since Members had only recently received the note which raised a number of substantive issues, his delegation would need to examine it in detail. His delegation would come back with specific comments on the points raised in the Secretariat note, particularly the concluding aspects of the various sections of the note. The Secretariat had mentioned the examination of RTAs notified under the Enabling Clause and some delegations had said that the RTAs among developing countries should be examined in the CRTA. In that context, he drew Members' attention to Paragraph 4(b) of the Enabling Clause which only referred ""prompt consultations"". There was no reference to ""examination"" in the Enabling Clause. He said that there was no need to go into further detail on that issue as his delegation's position was stated in paragraphs 106 and 107 of the minutes of the 44th Session of the CTD.4","WTCOMTDM45.pdf","India, Secretariat, Secretariat, CTD, Secretariat, Secretariat, Members, WTO, Secretariat, Members, Secretariat, Secretariat, CRTA, Members"
"4837",4837,"114","114.     The representative of Switzerland said that he considered that the conclusions of the Secretariat note were clear, as was the oral introduction given by the Secretariat. He said that he saw no reason not to agree to those conclusions. It was clear that the notifications had to come to the CTD. It was also clear that there was a body which had to examine RTAs and that, if the CTD would itself examine those agreements separately from the CRTA, it would have to create its own procedures. All representatives to the WTO worked within the same institution and delegations normally had one legal counsellor for the different parts of the WTO. Members should therefore have a unity of thinking within individual delegations. He did therefore not see any reason why the examination of RTAs among developing countries should not be delegated to the CRTA, as that was the only procedure which made sense. The CRTA would then have to report back to the CTD. The document was quite clear with respect to when the notifications had to be made. Members should therefore not spend much time on the issue but agree to the conclusions contained in the Secretariat note.","WTCOMTDM45.pdf","Switzerland, Secretariat, Secretariat, CTD, CTD, CRTA, WTO, WTO, Members, CRTA, CRTA, CTD, Members, Secretariat"

The delegation of Canada had suggested that the note be sent to the Negotiating Group on Rules for it to examine the note in the framework of its work. It was up to the CTD to decide whether the Secretariat note should be sent to the Negotiating Group on Rules. If the CTD agreed to do so, it would be for the Negotiating Group on Rules to decide how to use the Secretariat note.","WTCOMTDM45.pdf","Secretariat, CTD, Secretariat, Committee, Canada, Negotiating, Group, CTD, Secretariat, CTD, Negotiating, Group, Secretariat"

"4830",4830,"108","108.     The Secretariat went on to say that, as to which WTO Committee should examine such notifications, its note stated that, in practice, notifications had been sent to the CTD. The general overall power of the CTD to be a focus for developing country issues arguably made it a committee which could examine such notifications and also, as mandated by the Enabling Clause, hold the consultations that could be required by any Member on any Enabling Clause notification. The CTD had the power to hold periodic reviews on anything notified under the Enabling Clause and it also had the power to hold questions and answers on any application of an Enabling Clause provision. Hence, regional trade arrangements could be the subject of consultations and the note simply stated that if consultations were requested, as it is put in the Enabling Clause, such consultations must be held. Arguably, the CTD could handle such consultations although there was no procedure in place at the moment for such questions and answers relating to regional trade arrangements. However, the Committee on Regional Trade Agreements (CRTA) had been created after the CTD, and its mandate, contained in its terms of reference, indicated that it was a specialized WTO body for the examination of RTAs. The first paragraph of the mandate of the CRTA referred to notifications required under the Enabling Clause to the CTD. The mandate of the CRTA thus seemed to recognize the obligation to notify regional trade arrangements among developing countries to the CTD, but gave the CRTA the power to examine such arrangements. The last point made in the note by the Secretariat was that wherever the examination of a regional trade arrangement among developing countries was undertaken, it had to be done according to a mandate by the CTD, prescribing the conditions of the examination. In addition, such an examination could only be undertaken under the relevant applicable law which was the Enabling Clause. The Secretariat note concluded that it might be institutionally efficient and legally coherent to have all regional trade arrangements examined in the CRTA. as the services' aspects of such regional trade arrangements between developing countries would be notified to the Council for Trade in Services which would transfer the notification to the CRTA for examination. That would avoid the clashes and contradictions of having a single regional arrangement examined by the CRTA for its services' aspect and by the CTD for its goods' aspect.","WTCOMTDM45.pdf","Secretariat, WTO, Committee, CTD, CTD, Member, CTD, CTD, Committee, CRTA, CTD, WTO, CRTA, CTD, CRTA, CTD, CRTA, Secretariat, CTD, Secretariat, CRTA, Council, for, Trade, in, Services, CRTA, CRTA, CTD"
"4829",4829,"107","107.    The Secretariat said that it had been asked to examine what the notification requirements for RTAs between developing countries were, where such notifications should be made and whether there were other requirements for regional trade arrangements among developing countries. The expression regional trade arrangements among developing countries was the one used in the Enabling Clause. The note by the Secretariat began by considering the procedural notification requirements for regional trade arrangements among developing countries, from paragraph 18 onwards. The notification of a measure under the Enabling Clause had to be notified to the CONTRACTING PARTIES. CONTRACTING PARTIES, according to the definitions of GATT 1994, referred to WTO Members. Regional trade arrangements between developing countries clearly had to be notified to WTO Members. However, the question was to which WTO body. The Ministerial Conference had been mandated to assign to WTO bodies the functions that had previously been held by the different GATT bodies. The Secretariat note concluded that, although the administration and examination of the Enabling Clause had not been explicitly given to any WTO committee, it seemed that the CTD could be considered the appropriate body to receive such notifications and to consider them first, as was the practice. The second issue examined by the Secretariat note with regard to notifications was when WT/COMTD/M/45 Page 30 such notifications should be made. The Enabling Clause did again not provide a date but did refer to the obligation to notify ""when action was taken"". The note did not elaborate on what the actions relating to regional trade arrangements were before they entered into force. The note simply stated that they should be notified at the latest when they entered into force.","WTCOMTDM45.pdf","Secretariat, Secretariat, GATT, WTO, Members, WTO, Members, WTO, WTO, GATT, Secretariat, WTO, CTD, Secretariat"

"4826",4826,"104","104.

The note was before the Committee for consideration in document WT/COMTD/W/114.","WTCOMTDM45.pdf","Chairman, Committee, Secretariat, Trade, Policy, Review, Division, Committee"
"4825",4825,"103","103.

"4824",4824,"102","102.    He went on to say that he wished to give an overview of the new measures presented in detail in WTO document WT/COMTD/N/2/Add.12 of 12 May 2003 containing the notification by the Government of Japan. The number of LDCs' agricultural and fishery products qualifying for duty-free and quota-free treatment had been increased to around 500 items from around 300 items. In other words, an additional 200 items including prawns and frozen fish fillets had been added. As for LDCs' industrial products, almost all items had already been given duty-free and quota-free treatment. That expansion was expected to bring the percentage of products under such treatment from around 80 per cent to over 90 per cent of the total import value from the LDCs. The agricultural and fishery products which had been added were listed in Annexes I and II, as well as in the table related to                                                                                     WT/COMTD/M/45                                                                                            Page 29 paragraph 6 of the notification. In addition, the number of products under Japan's GSP scheme which benefited not only the LDCs, but also other developing countries had been increased. Around 120 new items had been added, almost all of which were agricultural products such dry as dried prunes, coconut oil, avocado and papayas. Furthermore, the tariff rates of around 60 existing items under the GSP scheme had been reduced. Japan's GSP scheme was open to 164 developing countries and regions on a non discriminatory basis. One hundred and eighteen (118) new agricultural products, listed in Annexes II and III as well as in a table relating to paragraph 7 of the notification, had also been added to the current 221 agricultural items that were eligible for GSP treatment. One industrial product, listed in Annex III, had been added as well. Furthermore, the tariff rates of 36 agricultural products under the GSP scheme, listed in Annex IV, had been reduced. As also shown in Annex IV, the tariff rates of 28 industrial products under the GSP had been reduced and 3 ceilings for industrial product groups had been eliminated. He said that his Government hoped that those measures and others, such as the TA activities, would contribute, together with the measures taken by other Members, to the development of the developing countries and the LDCs in particular.","WTCOMTDM45.pdf","WTO, Japan, Japan, GSP, Japan, GSP, GSP, GSP, Members"
"4823",4823,"101","101.     The representative of Japan introduced his Government's recent revisions to its GSP scheme. As his delegation had mentioned at several occasions, including during discussions at the CTD, it had considered expanding the number of products originating in the LDCs which received duty-free and quota-free treatment for fiscal year 2003, which started on 1 April 2003. The expansion of the product coverage had been done with a view to further contributing to the development of developing countries, especially the LDCs, through trade. Market access was one of the most important areas in the ongoing negotiations at the WTO. Besides the ongoing negotiations, many measures for improving market access for developing countries, in particular LDCs, had been taken by the Members, such as the ""Everything but Arms"" initiative by the European Communities' Commission and the ""African Growth and Opportunity Act"" by the Government of the United States. The Governments of Australia and Switzerland had also recently taken similar initiatives. Such measures were further encouraged by the Doha Development Agenda as seen for example in paragraph 42 of the Doha Ministerial Declaration. The Government of Japan had, like other Members, recently received a briefing at the Sub-Committee on Least-Developed Countries by the Canadian delegation on initiatives undertaken by the Government of Canada in favour of LDCs. His delegation remained one of the partners determined to continue to work towards the objective of duty-free and quota-free market access for all products originating in the LDCs. Against that background, the Government of Japan had taken the decision to immediately examine, in connection with the revision of its tariff- related laws, the possibility to expand the coverage of products originating in the LDCs receiving duty-free and quota-free treatment as announced at the meeting of the G8 in Kananaskis, Canada, in June 2002. The decision had taken concrete form as of 1 April 2003.","WTCOMTDM45.pdf","Japan, CTD, WTO, Members, European, Communities, ', Commission, United, States, Australia, Switzerland, Doha, Development, Agenda, Japan, Members, Canada, Japan, LDCs, Kananaskis, Canada"

The representative of Malaysia said that the suggestion made by the representative of United States to receive information on what the negotiating bodies were doing that might be linked to paragraph 51 of the Doha Ministerial Declaration was a good idea. She said that, since the CTD might not have the resources to do everything at once, she suggested that the Committee request information from one or two negotiating groups at a time in order to allow for discussions. She said that what the representative of Kenya had said on commodities might relate to the agricultural negotiations and suggested that it might be useful to begin by inviting information regarding the agricultural negotiations.","WTCOMTDM44.pdf","Malaysia, United, States, CTD, Committee, Kenya"
"4804",4804,"96","96.      The representative of the United States suggested that Members initially consider a practical way to proceed. Much work was being done in other WTO bodies such as the consideration of the modalities with respect to S&D, reciprocity in the context of market access, the overarching S&D issues, the S&D monitoring mechanism, and work in the rules area. In light of all that she asked whether it would be possible for the CTD to periodically receive information from Secretariat staff on                                                                                    WT/COMTD/M/44                                                                                           Page 29 what the different negotiating groups were doing in relation to the development agenda. Her delegation was flexible with respect to how that might be done. However, as delegations seemed to have concerns about what the Committee could do with respect to paragraph 51 of the Doha Ministerial Declaration, she suggested that an information process might be a pragmatic start that would assist delegations understand the breath and the depth of the relationships. She agreed with the representative from the European Communities that learning from other ongoing events, such as the NGO Symposium on sustainable development, might be useful in deciding on how to treat the issue in the CTD in the future.","WTCOMTDM44.pdf","United, States, Members, WTO, S&D, CTD, Secretariat, Committee, CTD"
"4803",4803,"95","95.     The Chairman said that he would discuss the issue of scheduling a future meeting of the CTD back-to-back with the NGO Symposium with the incoming Chairperson of the CTD.","WTCOMTDM44.pdf","Chairman, CTD, Chairperson, CTD"
"4802",4802,"94","94.      The representative of the European Communities said that his delegation's views on the issue were well known. He was therefore not in a position to respond to the Chairman's request for new ideas on how to deal with it. His delegation maintained the view that paragraph 51 of the Doha Ministerial Declaration was important. It was of importance and mutual interest to all delegations to give effect to it in a more substantive way than Members had previously been able to. What had been said in the CTD and in other WTO fora in recent weeks had reinforced the benefit and mutual interest of taking the instruction in paragraph 51 of the Doha Ministerial Declaration forward in a more concrete manner. The representative of Kenya had raised an item relating to commodities which seemed linked to other aspects of the Doha Development Agenda, in particular to market access, subsidies and developmental concerns. Apart from those particular points raised with respect to commodities, Members were aware of the discussions relating to S&D and in determining the modalities of the market access negotiations. One important theme in that respect was how to take account of the particular concerns and interests of developing countries. It was not an aspect that was only taken up in the context of the market access negotiations, but it was an important element of the more regulatory discussions taking place in other groups within the structure of the Doha Development Agenda. It was increasingly urgent to reach agreement on how to give effect to paragraph 51 of the Doha Ministerial Declaration. He further said that his delegation attached importance to the NGO seminar on sustainable development to be held in June 2003. He suggested that to maximize the synergies between the meetings of the CTD and that Symposium, it might be useful to schedule a future meeting of the CTD back-to-back with the Symposium. That would create greater scope for interaction, in an informal manner, between the two events. Such interaction was important in order to give an effective focus to the outreach activity in form of the Symposium.","WTCOMTDM44.pdf","European, Communities, Chairman, Members, CTD, WTO, Kenya, Doha, Development, Agenda, Members, Doha, Development, Agenda, CTD, CTD"
"4801",4801,"93","93.      The Chairman said that agenda Item G was a standing item on the agenda which related to paragraph 51 of the Doha Ministerial Declaration on identifying and debating developmental and environmental aspects of the negotiations in order to help achieve the objective of having sustainable development appropriately reflected. Shortly after the Johannesburg World Summit on Sustainable Development it had been agreed that the CTD might consider the negotiated documents that emerged from that Summit. Those documents, in their preliminary versions, had been circulated to Members in multi-symbol document WT/COMTD/W/106 - WT/CTE/W/220, as the CTE had also wished to consider them. In that context, he informed Members that the final versions had been circulated as document WT/COMTD/W/106/Rev.1. - WT/CTE/W/220/Rev.1. He said that Members had had some time to consider how they wished to deal with the issue in the context of the CTD and sought Members' views on how to move the issue forward in the CTD.","WTCOMTDM44.pdf","Chairman, Johannesburg, CTD, Members, CTE, Members, Members, CTD, Members, CTD"

"4798",4798,"90","90.      The representative of Egypt said that the paper outlined the good work that had been carried out on e-commerce in the CTD. As mentioned by the representative of the United States, the paper had recently been circulated which was why his comments were preliminary. He would provide more detailed comments at a later stage. His delegation believed that the process had to be reactivated. It had been shown that e-commerce could be one way of enhancing the economic performance of developing countries and LDCs. The papers submitted in the past as well as the seminars convened in the WTO and elsewhere outlined the major areas that would require consideration in the discussions on e-commerce. Most important were the questions of how a developing country could be e-ready for it to reap the real benefits of e-commerce and how the negative implications of e-commerce on exports from developing countries could be mitigated. The representative of Canada had, in an earlier intervention, underscored the importance of South-South trade. He believed that enhancing the e-capacity of developing countries would contribute substantially to their economic development. Paragraph 15 of the Secretariat paper captured the issues that needed to be addressed under the rubric of e-commerce and mainstreaming trade for developing countries' growth. His delegation believed that Members should base their discussions on the report submitted to the General Council in 2000. The focus should be on the issues which fell within the competence of the CTD. Members could also draw on the relevant papers issued in other relevant international organizations. The aim should be to formulate a set of recommendations for Ministers to consider. His delegation looked forward to continue the work on e-commerce at a faster pace in order to make operational the means that would help developing countries reap the benefits of e-commerce.

"4797",4797,"9","9.       He further said that, although the WTO was a trade forum, he wished to situate the Canadian initiative more widely to show that the Government of Canada was attempting to develop a coherent policy on trade and development. One example was that the Government of Canada, amongst other nations, had been promoting the inclusion of trade in the Poverty Reduction Strategy Papers that were being developed in the context of the World Bank and were being used by the IMF. The Government of Canada was of the view that economic growth had to be developed in order for poverty reduction to be achieved. Trade was one contributor to economic growth, although not the only one. Canada had benefitted from its trade relations and from the advantage of having a good neighbor which had enhanced Canada's economic position. Enhancing trade would contribute to poverty reduction, as identified in the Millennium Goals that all Governments had agreed to in the United Nations. Investment could be stimulated by trade liberalization, particularly in the LDCs, and that would provide further opportunities for growth. Aid in itself was not sufficient to alleviate poverty. The initiative by the Government of Canada was therefore to provide duty-free and quota-free access for all products originating in 48 LDCs, with the exception of three types of agricultural products which were under supply management in Canada, i.e. dairy products, poultry products, and eggs. However, those exceptions only represented about 200 tariff lines out of the 8000 tariff lines in the Canadian tariff which provided complete duty and quota-free access for products originating in LDCs. Nevertheless, the Government of Canada had, even in those supply-managed products, made in-quota access commitments which were open to any country to benefit from. The LDC tariff (the LDCT in Canada) concerned approximately 90 per cent of the Canadian schedule prior to the new initiative. The Government of Canada had, with the new initiative for LDCs, moved into sensitive sectors of the Canadian economy, such as textiles, clothing, sugar, foot-ware, that had, in Canadian economic terms, traditionally enjoyed a higher form of protection than other products. It had not been an easy task for the Government of Canada to secure a consensus to undertake the initiative for LDCs. He said that he believed that it was through the initiative of the Prime Minister of Canada, and his commitment to the African Agenda as expressed through the NEPAD, and the support of Mr. Pettigrew, Minister for International Trade, that the LDC initiative had materialized.","WTCOMTDM44.pdf","WTO, Canada, Canada, World, Bank, IMF, Canada, Canada, Canada, United, Nations, Canada, Canada, Canada, LDCT, Canada, Canada, LDCs, Government, of, Canada, Canada, Pettigrew"
"4796",4796,"89","89.     The representative of Canada said that her delegation's preliminary view was that the paper appropriately outlined the important work carried out by the CTD. She noted that the CTD had been one of the more active of the four subsidiary bodies to the General Council currently engaged in the Work Programme on E-commerce. Her delegation looked forward to continued work in that area within the CTD. E-commerce represented an important means of doing business in the knowledge- based economy and had the potential to benefit developed and developing countries alike. Her delegation looked forward to building upon the work already carried out in the CTD in the area of e- commerce and welcomed other Members' views on how best to proceed.","WTCOMTDM44.pdf","Canada, CTD, General, Council, Work, Programme, CTD, Members"

At the 42nd Session of the CTD, the delegation of Canada had asked for a document which would update delegation's memory on the work that had been carried out in the CTD with respect to electronic commerce (e-commerce). Document WT/COMTD/W/110, which aimed to respond to that request, showed that the CTD had actually been one of the most active of the four subsidiary bodies of the General Council which were tasked to consider the issue of e-commerce. An extensive educational process had been undertaken on issues relating to electronic commerce and development. He invited comments on the document and asked Members for ideas about how they wished to handle the issue of e-commerce in the CTD.","WTCOMTDM44.pdf","Chairman, Electronic, Commerce, Committee, CTD, Canada, CTD, CTD, General, Council, Members, CTD"

That trade was important to their economic development programmes. The representative of Kenya had clearly outlined how the lack of stability of commodity prices could provoke crisis situations in the exporting countries. Her delegation fully endorsed the initiative to raise the issue of commodity trade in the WTO, and specifically in the CTD, with a view to examine what trade-related action might be necessary, and possible, in the WTO. That consideration should be made with the short term aim of making recommendations for action to the Cancún Ministerial Conference.","WTCOMTDM44.pdf","Barbados, Kenya, WTO, CTD, WTO"

"4786",4786,"8","8.       The representative of Canada said that he was pleased to present the notification containing the initiative by the Government of Canada to enhance market access for the LDCs in accordance with the Enabling Clause. He also said that, judging from what he had seen of the report on the trade policy review of Canada that would be held the following week, he anticipated that the WTO would once again recognize that the Government of Canada pursued an open trade policy, and that Canada                                                                                    WT/COMTD/M/44                                                                                            Page 3 had benefited significantly from its liberalized trade regime. Trade had led the economic growth of Canada for the last decade. It was only in the last few months that domestic economic activity had led economic growth in Canada. The Canadian economy was strong, the fundamentals good and growth projections for 2003 and 2004 were anticipated to lead the Group of Eight industrialized countries (G8). While trade was important for Canada, he said that his Government believed that trade was important for all countries. Part of his responsibilities, as Director-General for Economic Policy in the Foreign Affairs Department of the Government of Canada, included his Government's relations with developing countries. In addition to trade relations, it included relations from the perspective of development, debt, and the international institutions that dealt with developing country issues. The Government of Canada had been following the development policy evolution in the international community during the past five years. The International Conference on Financing for Development, held in Monterrey, Mexico on 18-22 March 2002, had been a seminal event which had set out a new blue-print for relations between developed and developing countries. Later in 2002, the Prime Minister of Canada had chaired the Annual Meeting of the G8 held in Kananaskis, Canada. Key to that meeting was the initiative to enhance relations between the G8 and African countries. The Canadian initiative of increased market access for LDCs had been taken in that broader overall development context.","WTCOMTDM44.pdf","Canada, Canada, LDCs, Canada, WTO, Canada, Canada, Canada, Canada, Canada, Director-General, Foreign, Affairs, Department, Canada, Canada, Monterrey, Mexico, Canada, Kananaskis, Canada, LDCs"
"4785",4785,"79","79.    Before concluding, she emphasized that her delegation, as well as the delegations of Uganda, Tanzania, Lesotho and Zimbabwe on whose behalf she was making the statement, were keen on         1             TN/AG/W/1 WT/COMTD/M/44 Page 26 ensuring that the recommendations of the CTD on the type of action that could be taken in WTO to deal with the problems posed as a result of declining prices of primary commodities, was made available, as appropriate, to the Cancún Ministerial Conference. Since there would be at best two regular sessions of the Committee before that date, the sponsors of the non-paper considered that it might be necessary for the Committee to convene special sessions or appoint a Sub-Committee to consider the issues relating to the prices of primary commodities which she had raised. To facilitate discussions on those issues, she requested the incoming Chairman to arrange for informal consultations in the third week of March, immediately after the circulation of the non-paper. That consultation would enable Members to agree on the background research papers that would be needed for the examination of the various elements to which she had referred, and allocate the responsibility for preparing them among the WTO, UNCTAD, the Commonwealth Secretariat and other agencies which would be invited to participate in the discussions on the subject. She said that she had highlighted the main issues in the non-paper, as that would enable delegations to study them and come prepared to participate in the informal discussions to be held. For people in Kenya, and those in about 50 other developing countries which were heavily dependent on exports of primary commodities, the ongoing Doha Development Round would only be meaningful if it succeed in finding solutions, during the course of the negotiations, to the problems posed by declining prices of commodities. If the Doha Development Round failed to find such solutions, the Round might not have any significant impact on the trade and development of those countries. She encouraged other Members affected by declining primary commodity prices to consider co-sponsoring the non-paper when it was circulated.","WTCOMTDM44.pdf","Uganda, Tanzania, Lesotho, Zimbabwe, CTD, WTO, Cancún, Ministerial, Conference, Committee, Committee, Sub-Committee, Chairman, Members, WTO, Commonwealth, Secretariat, Kenya, Doha, Development, Round, Doha, Development, Round, Members"
"4784",4784,"78","78.      She continued by saying that a more definitive legal basis for negotiations on stabilization of prices of primary commodities that were of export interest to developing countries was provided in Part IV (chapter on Trade and Development) of the GATT 1994. Its Article XXXVI, which laid down principles and objectives, stated that: There is a need … to devise … measures designed to stabilize and improve conditions of world markets in these (primary) products including in particular measures designed to attain stable, equitable and remunerative prices. Those provisions were complemented by Article XXXVIII on ""joint action"" which inter alia stated that towards that end, Members might negotiate and adopt ""international arrangements"" providing for: Improved and acceptable conditions to access to world markets of primary products of particular interest to developing countries; and Measures designed to stabilize and improve conditions of world markets in these products, including measures designed to attain stable, equitable and remunerative prices for exports of such products. Taking into account the responsibility which the above-mentioned provisions of GATT put on WTO Members, the non-paper intended to propose that the CTD examine on a priority basis the impact which the crisis situation created by declining prices had on: the trade and development of countries which were heavily dependent on exports of primary commodities; and their capacity to pay and service their foreign debts. Such an examination, as envisaged in Article XXXVIII, should further aim at drawing out a program for ""joint action"" that could be taken in the course of ongoing work and negotiations in WTO.","WTCOMTDM44.pdf","GATT, Members, GATT, WTO, Members, CTD, WTO"
"4783",4783,"77","77.      She then said that the focus in the present round of negotiations would be to also secure further improvements of market access, particularly through securing further reductions in the tariffs applicable to processed products and on the removal of tariff escalation. Some progress might also be made in requiring developed countries to reduce trade distorting domestic and export subsidies (including export finance and credits) which they granted to tropical products such as cotton and sugar. Unless definite decisions were taken to broaden the area of negotiations, issues relating to the impact of declining prices of primary commodities on trade and development were not expected to be covered by the negotiations. UNCTAD had so far provided the main forum for discussions on the problems faced by commodity exporting countries as a result of declining prices of primary commodities and their volatility. Its mandate to work on commodity issues had enabled it to renegotiate, in the second half of seventies, the existing international agreements on commodities such as those on coffee, cocoa and sugar and to promote the establishment of the common fund for commodities. She noticed that, when taking into account the role which UNCTAD had played in the past and was playing at present in the commodity field, it was often argued that the WTO should not get involved in the discussions on the stabilization of prices. In that context, she said that she thought that it was important for Members to note that during the same period negotiations for developing commodity agreements for coffee, cocoa and sugar had been held in UNCTAD, arrangements for the management of supplies, through inter alia, control over production of bovine meat and diary products had been adopted during the agricultural negotiations in the Tokyo Round (viz. Agreement on Bovine Meat and International Agreement on Dairy Products). The International Agreement on Diary Products had also provided a mechanism for the maintenance of prices at agreed levels.","WTCOMTDM44.pdf","UNCTAD, UNCTAD, WTO, Members, UNCTAD, Tokyo"
"4782",4782,"76","76.      She further said that, in the past rounds of negotiations held under the auspices of the GATT, the negotiations for the liberalization of trade in primary agricultural commodities which were produced predominantly in the tropics, had not been held in the negotiating group on agriculture, but in a separate group constituted for that purpose. The priority attention given to the removal of tariffs and non tariff measures affecting trade in tropical products in the past rounds, resulted in the elimination of tariffs on almost all tropical products in their primary form by all developed countries. However, some of those countries still maintained duties on an MFN basis on imports of processed products, except in cases where duties had been lowered under preferential arrangements. In the present round of negotiations, no separate negotiating group on tropical products had been constituted. Negotiations addressing problems in the trade in those products were expected to take place in the Special Session of the Committee on Agriculture, which was responsible for negotiating the liberalization of trade in agricultural products. In his first draft containing possible modalities that could be adopted for negotiations on agriculture, the Chairman of the Special Session of the Committee on Agriculture had proposed that ""In implementing their market access commitments, developed country Members should take fully into account the particular needs and conditions of developing country Members by providing for greater improvement of opportunities and terms of access for agricultural products of particular interest to these Members, including the fullest                                                                                      WT/COMTD/M/44                                                                                             Page 25 liberalization of trade in tropical products, whether in primary or in processed form, ..."".1 Further, in order to ensure that reductions made in the MFN tariff did not lead to a sudden disruption of trade to countries which benefit from preferential access, the paper proposed that, in implementing their commitments, ""participants extending preferential treatment, should undertake to maintain to the extent possible, the nominal margins and other terms and conditions they accord to their developed country partners"". However, past work and the negotiations in the GATT had centered almost entirely on securing improvements in the access for tropical products in the markets of developed countries through removal of tariffs and other barriers of trade.","WTCOMTDM44.pdf","GATT, MFN, Committee, on, Agriculture, Chairman, Committee, on, Agriculture, Members, Members, Members, MFN, GATT"
"4781",4781,"75","75.      She went on to say that, until the last months of 2002, the prices of primary commodities had prevailed at exceptionally low levels. For instance, the prices of coffee, cocoa, sugar and palm oil had declined by nearly 70 per cent in the 22 year period from 1980 to 2002. The prices of other agricultural commodities had also declined during the same period, but by a lesser percentage. They included the prices of cotton and vegetable oils like coconut oil, which were almost 50 per cent lower in 2000 when compared to the prevailing price-levels in 1980. Nearly 50 developing countries depended on three or fewer commodities for a large proportion of their exports. In the case of Kenya, Uganda and Tanzania for example, three primary commodities (i.e. coffee, tea and cotton) accounted for between 42 to 44 per cent of their merchandise exports. The prices of a number of commodities had risen in recent months. However, in the case of agricultural commodities such as coffee, cotton and vegetable oils, that was the result of poor harvests caused by bad weather and drought in some of the producing countries. In the case of cocoa, the rise in prices partly reflected the impact of civil war on production in Côte d'Ivoire. The present sudden rise in commodity prices was thus temporary. It was a result of short-term supply constraints and did not reflect any long lasting trend towards improved balance between world supply and demand. The secular trend towards a decline in the prices of those commodities and their volatility had created a crisis situation in most of the commodity producing countries, as there was a close relationship between world market prices and poverty levels. In most of the countries, the production of crops such as coffee, cocoa and sugarcane was undertaken by poor subsistence farmers, who in most cases were heavily indebted. The decline in prices for their produce had further reduced their meager income. Small scale coffee and cocoa farmers were currently getting a third of the price they had been receiving in earlier years. The result was that an increasing number of farmers who produced those crops were living below poverty levels. The worst affected were the heavily indebted countries, which directed major portions of their foreign exchange revenue towards the servicing of debts. The ability of those and other developing countries to alleviate poverty and to integrate themselves into the fast growing global economy was therefore greatly dependent on how quickly they were able to address the decline in the terms of trade for primary commodities. That observation lead to the question of what action WTO Members could take and why action was necessary in the WTO. She said that, in the view of her delegation and of those that were co-sponsoring the non-paper, there were two reasons why it would be necessary to address, in the ongoing work and negotiations in WTO, the problems posed to the trade and development of developing countries by declining prices of primary commodities. Firstly, as all countries attached political importance to the role of the WTO, raising the crisis situation created by declining commodity prices for discussions in the WTO might bring to the attention of the general public the need and urgency of taking early action at the international level. Secondly, and more importantly, that would facilitate a resolution on the basis of WTO's rules-based system, including, in the context of the ongoing negotiations for the liberalization of trade in the agricultural sector.","WTCOMTDM44.pdf","Kenya, Uganda, Tanzania, WTO, Members, WTO, WTO, WTO, WTO, WTO"

They had intended to circulate a non-paper as a basis for discussions. That paper contained some preliminary ideas on action that could be taken under the WTO rules-based system to deal with the crisis situation which had been created by the long term trend of declining commodity prices and its implications for the trade and development of developing countries, most of which were heavily dependent on exports of primary commodities. The continuous series of WTO meetings held during the previous two weeks had made it impossible for the interested delegations to meet and finalize the paper. It had therefore been decided that she should make a brief statement highlighting some of the issues in the non-paper. She expected to be able to submit the non-paper to the Secretariat within the coming two weeks for circulation to Members. She said that her statement was being made on behalf of the delegations of Uganda, Tanzania, Lesotho and Zimbabwe who had all agreed to co-sponsor the non-paper.

The Chairman said that the delegation of Egypt had requested that the subject matter for the Trade and Environment Symposium for NGOs be referred to Members so that Members could comment on it in both the CTD and the CTE and that the Symposium could only be organized thereafter. The Secretariat had drawn his attention to a problem with regard to the sequencing of the Trade and Environment Symposium for NGOs and the need to consult the Members of the CTD and the CTE. As the Symposium would be held in mid-June it seemed difficult to ensure that an additional meeting of the CTD would be held sufficiently in advance of the Symposium to discuss its modalities, agenda and participation. He therefore proposed that the External Relations Division soon circulate a paper regarding the Trade and Environment Symposium for NGOs. Members would then get an opportunity to discuss that paper at the CTE meeting in April 2003. Any comments by any Member of the CTD could be communicated to the organizers of the Symposium.","WTCOMTDM44.pdf","Chairman, Egypt, Members, Members, CTD, CTE, Secretariat, Members, CTD, CTE, CTD, Members, CTE, Member, CTD"

The representative of Egypt said that, what Members had decided in the 43rd Session of the CTD when the issue of the Trade and Environment Symposium for NGOs had been discussed was that the modalities of the Symposium would be approved by both the CTD and the CTE, and not that every interested delegation had to individually contact the External Relations Division. What his delegation expected was that a draft, including the issues to be discussed and other aspects of the Symposium, be circulated both in the CTD and in the CTE. The CTD and in the CTE would then approve the plans for the Symposium before it was to be held.","WTCOMTDM44.pdf","Egypt, Members, CTD, CTD, CTE, CTD, CTE, CTD, CTE"
"4772",4772,"67","67.     The Secretariat (Mr. Paul Rolian, Director, Technical Cooperation Division) said, in response to a question posed by the delegation of Egypt, that attendance at certain conferences allowed the Secretariat to hold back-to-back activities during which the Secretariat explained the work of the WTO in the particular field, such as the link between trade and environment. Such activities were not only open to Governments but also to the environment community at large. The Secretariat saw this as a good way to pass an important message. Several of the activities referred to had been part of the 2002 TA Plan. The ones that had not been inscribed in the 2002 TA Plan had been carried out in the same spirit of taking the opportunity, at a low cost (the cost of sending a staff member) to brief the Conference attendees of what the WTO was doing in the area of trade and environment. The representative of Malaysia had suggested that the Secretariat be careful when establishing the roster of experts to outsource to, and that it should ensure that developing country experts be included. He assured delegations that anybody who had the necessary qualifications, competence and profile could be included in the roster. He was convinced that many such experts would come from developing country regions. The roster could be made available to Members if the persons in question authorized the Secretariat to transmit the information to others; it would otherwise have to be treated in confidence. He said that the Secretariat was not currently thinking of making a special link between                                                                                   WT/COMTD/M/44                                                                                          Page 23 the trade policy clinics and the IF. However, if ways of tying them together became apparent they could be more closely linked in the future; but they were separate initiatives for the time being.","WTCOMTDM44.pdf","Secretariat, Paul, Rolian, Director, Technical, Cooperation, Division, Egypt, Secretariat, Secretariat, WTO, Secretariat, WTO, Malaysia, Secretariat, Members, Secretariat, Secretariat"
"4771",4771,"66","66.     The Secretariat (Mr. Alberto Campeas, Director, Development Division) said, in response to the query by the delegation of Egypt, that the CTE had been informed, just as the CTD had been at the current meeting, of the future organization of the Trade and Environment Symposium for NGOs. There had been no detailed discussion in the CTE which seemed to indicate a positive reception by Members of the plans by the Secretariat. The External Relations Division of the Secretariat was in charge of preparing the programme. If Members wished to see specific elements reflected in the programme, he suggested that they contact the External Relations Division in order for their ideas to be included.","WTCOMTDM44.pdf","Secretariat, Alberto, Campeas, Director, Development, Division, Egypt, CTE, CTD, CTE, Members, Secretariat, Secretariat, Members"
"4770",4770,"65","65.      The representative of Thailand said that her delegation agreed with other delegations that the qualitative aspect of the TA Plan was important. Her delegation was therefore awaiting the evaluation of the implementation of the 2002 TA Plan. She sought more information on the partnerships between the WTO and other organizations and suggested that it would be useful for delegations to get updated information on that cooperation. There seemed to have been some recent developments in that area as she had learned that the WTO had signed an MoU the previous week with the International Institute on Trade and Development in Thailand. Her delegation was grateful for that and hoped that that cooperation would improve the TA delivered in the Asian region. With respect to the trade policy clinics she said that her delegation supported the thrust of the idea and saw it as another way to help developing countries. However, it had to be flexible and should not duplicate existing TA programmes. She therefore looked forward to receiving more information on the trade policy clinics from the Secretariat.","WTCOMTDM44.pdf","Thailand, WTO, WTO, International, Institute, on, Trade, and, Development, Thailand, Secretariat"
"4769",4769,"64","64.      She further said that the Secretariat needed to be careful in the selection of consultants to outsource to in order to maintain the quality of the TA delivered. Her delegation therefore supported the establishment of proper criteria and guidelines for the sourcing of the experts. The use of ex-Secretariat staff or former Ambassadors, as well as academic staff was welcome. She hoped that there would be a balance between developed and developing country experts. However, that should not effect the overriding criteria that the experts should possess the requisite expertise. Her delegation thus agreed with the suggestion made by the representatives of Barbados and Tunisia for a regional perspective in the sourcing of the experts. She sought clarification with respect to the preparation of the roster and whether it would be made available to Members as some Members might wish to make use of that list of experts for their own technical cooperation programmes. She said that her delegation was of the understanding that the trade clinics were meant to address Members' trade WT/COMTD/M/44 Page 22 policy problems from a macro perspective. Appropriate resources would therefore have to be made available. She asked who the Secretariat envisaged would be in position to provide that diagnostic analysis and the corresponding trade policy advice and if there were any particular linkages between the trade policy clinics and the IF. Her delegation welcomed the suggestion made by the representative of the United States for different modes of delivery to be considered. On-line delivery had been proposed and she said that she believed that that could be helpful. For example, the material used in WTO TA delivery could be made available online for officials in capitals to be able to access it. There had been a recent proposal for the attachment of capital based officials in the missions. That was a practical way of enhancing developing countries' expertise in the WTO by actual on-site experience. It would also enhance Members' ability to participate in the WTO and she asked whether that was part of the 2003 TA Plan. Lastly, she said that her delegation welcomed the attention given to the economies from regions constituting special challenges. She sought clarification as to how they would be treated in the 2003 TA Plan. She asked whether they would be involved in the activities for the regions already identified or whether a separate category would be created for them.","WTCOMTDM44.pdf","Secretariat, Barbados, Tunisia, Members, Members, Members, Secretariat, United, States, WTO, WTO, Members, WTO"
"4768",4768,"63","63.      The representative of Malaysia said that TA remained a cornerstone of WTO activity and welcomed the contributions made to the DDAGTF, particularly the announcements made by the delegations of Australia and Japan. She noted the comments that had been made by the delegations of the United States, Canada and the European Communities and those that had been made at previous meetings by developing country members regarding the need for effective, targeted TA. The evaluation of the activities carried out in 2002 was going to be helpful in that respect and would help Members plan the activities for 2004. Future TA plans should lead to more substantive outcomes in the area of capacity building. Her delegation agreed that there should be a proper regional balance of the WTO TA activities, including the host countries for regional activities. However, she knew that the location chosen sometimes depended on the partner organization. She therefore suggested that the WTO Secretariat explore with the other organizations the possibility of some rotation of host countries for regional TA activities. Her Government had had the opportunity to host a regional activity in 2002 from which it had benefited a lot. Nevertheless, based on previous experience, her Government felt that more importance should be attached to coordination with the host country when organizing regional activities. That would facilitate the delivery of the activity and would ensure a more substantive outcome.","WTCOMTDM44.pdf","Malaysia, WTO, Australia, Japan, United, States, Canada, Members, WTO, WTO, Secretariat"
"4767",4767,"62","62.      The representative of Egypt asked the Secretariat to provide information on the outcome of the consultations with the CTE relating to the Trade and Environment Symposium for NGOs. He further asked whether the paper on the Trade and Environment Symposium for NGOs would include the issues to be discussed at the Symposium and its expected outcome. He also asked whether the CTD would approve that document or simply take note of it. With respect to document WT/COMTD/W/101/Add.4 he questioned the activities described as ""Conference/Briefing"". One example in the area of Trade and Environment could be found on page 50. He wondered how the CITES Conference could be described as a TA activity and how it related to paragraph 33 of the Doha Ministerial Declaration. He assumed that the activities labelled ""Conference/Briefing"" meant that a WTO official attended that Conference, and that, in the case of the CITES, the WTO, attended the Conference as an observer and briefed the participants about the WTO. He questioned how that could be regarded as TA, especially as the participants in those conferences came from both developed and developing countries. He asked if the travel costs for the WTO Secretariat person attending that Conference was covered by the Trust Fund reserved for TA.","WTCOMTDM44.pdf","Egypt, Secretariat, CTD, WTO, WTO, WTO, WTO, Secretariat, Trust, Fund"
"4766",4766,"61","61.     The Secretariat (Mr. Alberto Campeas, Director, Development Division) said that, as delegations would recall, the 2003 TA Plan had an Addendum 2 containing ""Outreach Activities""                                                                                      WT/COMTD/M/44                                                                                             Page 21 (WT/COMTD/W/104/Add.2). The first of the outreach activities listed there was a Trade and Environment Symposium for NGOs to be held in Geneva. Linked to that activity was a footnote which stated that the Secretariat would consult Members in the Committee on Trade and Environment (CTE) and the CTD on the modalities, agenda and participation in respect of that symposium. The CTE had been consulted at its meeting on 14 February 2003 and he said that the Secretariat would, at the current meeting, welcome any input from the CTD on those points. He informed the Committee that the focal point in the WTO Secretariat for the event was the External Relations Division (Mr. Hans-Peter Werner and Mr. Bernard Kuiten) and that the Symposium, which was being financed by the Government of Norway, was scheduled for 16-17 June 2003. An information note would be issued to Members later in March 2003.","WTCOMTDM44.pdf","Secretariat, Alberto, Campeas, Director, Development, Division, Geneva, Secretariat, Members, Committee, CTD, CTE, Secretariat, CTD, Committee, WTO, Secretariat, Hans-Peter, Werner, Bernard, Kuiten, Norway, Members"
"4765",4765,"60","60.      He went on to respond to the questions raised by the representative of Bangladesh and said that five regional LDC-specific activities had been undertaken in 2002. At least one LDC had been invited to over 80 regional activities which meant that in 80 regional activities there was at least one LDC present. Twenty-four per cent of the 109 planned national activities executed in 2002 had taken place in and benefited LDCs, i.e. 45 activities. With respect to the identification of lead agencies for the activities he said that that was not always as straight forward as it might appear. It was particularly difficult to identify a lead agency for jointly programmed and delivered activities when the WTO Secretariat worked in collaboration with partner agencies. A lead agency was not always established for joint activities. The practice had so far been to merely identify the agency with which the Secretariat collaborated for any given activity. With respect to the question of cancellations of activities and why the IF and mainstreaming activities had been singled out as being problematic, he said that it was not always possible to deliver activities planned 12 to 15 months in advance since many of them require the establishment of appropriate mechanisms in the beneficiary countries as well as among the six core agencies collaborating on the IF and the donor community. The Diagnostic Trade Integration Studies (DTIS) could only be conducted once local and international experts had been recruited. Roundtables could only take place once the various stakeholders had had time to review priority areas of action identified in the DTIS, and a lead donor had been identified. Finally, the time-frames in which the different agencies operated were not always the same. With respect to the point made by the representative of Tunisia, he said that it was statistically true that the lowest implementation rate was found for the activities planned in Africa. However, it was the lowest percentage of the highest number of activities. The more activities were planned, the more likely it was that something might happen that would make it impossible to carry out some of the activities. The Secretariat was considering the re-programming of some of those activities. Nevertheless, if the conditions which led to the cancellation of the activity in the first place had not changed, the activity could probably still not be carried out. The representative of the European Communities had made a comment about having a continuous process of improvement of WTO TA as it was implemented. The Secretariat would consider if improvements could be made, although it would not consider changing the 2003 TA Plan as it had been agreed by Members. More importantly, the Secretariat would soon begin to consider what kind of programme to propose to Members for 2004. That was what he had referred to when speaking about the ad hoc activities. How such activities were to be considered was a function of how the overall TA Plan was conceived.","WTCOMTDM44.pdf","Bangladesh, LDC, WTO, Secretariat, Secretariat, Tunisia, Africa, Secretariat, WTO, Secretariat, Members, Secretariat, Members"

"4763",4763,"59","59.   The Secretariat (Mr. Paul Rolian, Director, Technical Cooperation Division) said that the commitment by the Secretariat to provide an evaluation of the 2002 TA activities by the end of WT/COMTD/M/44 Page 20 March 2003 would be honoured. That evaluation would respond to many of the comments made about the desire to have a fuller picture of what had happened in 2002, compared to what the Secretariat had been able to provide in the document containing statistical information on the implementation of the 2002 TA Plan (WT/COMTD/W/101/Add.4). Several delegations had agreed with the suggestion made by the representative of Canada about the desirability to have a link in the reporting between the activities implemented and the financial and human resources needed to carry them out. If something more was needed than the information that had already been made available to the Budget Committee, the Secretariat would be happy to consider how it might provide such information. Several delegations had expressed an interest in the three commitments that DDG Dr. Rana had referred to and for which he had promised further documentation: namely the issues of outsourcing, access to the DDAGTF and the trade clinics. The Secretariat would be working on all of those issues and would take the useful comments that had been made into account in the more detailed proposals it would be making. However, as far as the guidelines for the DDAGTF were concerned, the Secretariat was of the view that that was something for Members to decide. The Secretariat would follow any guidance it received. Many comments had also been made with respect to the ad hoc activities. The message to the Secretariat seemed to be that a degree of flexibility had to be maintained. The question was what degree of flexibility and in relation to what. That was also something that the Secretariat would be reflecting on when proposals for the 2004 TA Plan were elaborated and in carrying out the activities for 2003.","WTCOMTDM44.pdf","Secretariat, Paul, Rolian, Director, Technical, Cooperation, Division, Secretariat, Secretariat, Canada, Budget, Committee, Secretariat, Rana, Secretariat, Secretariat, Members, Secretariat, Secretariat, Secretariat"
"4762",4762,"58","58.      The representative of China said that his delegation believed that the TA activities offered were useful to developing countries, particularly the LDCs and the recently acceded Members of the WTO. It provided them with opportunities to better understand the WTO Agreements and thereby helped improve their implementation of those agreements. TA activities assisted developing country Members participate fully in the new round of negotiations. He believed that Members should stick to the principles they had agreed to when formulating the 2004 TA Plan. The possibility of making ad hoc requests was one of them. That TA activities should be demand and member driven was another. There had to be a balance in the TA activities offered to different Members. That balanced treatment was important and was reflected in the 2003 TA Plan. However, flexibility had to be applied in treating ad hoc requests. Factors such as a specific need and situation, the status of the requesting Member in world trade, how long it had been a Member of the WTO, and the availability of human and financial resources had to be taken into account. With respect to the financial resources, he said that Members should not only rely on the DDAGTF but should also seek other forms of financing. Taking his own Government as an example, he said that some of the WTO TA activities from which the Government of China had benefited in 2002 had either been financed or co-financed by the Government of China, through bilateral assistance or through other international organizations. While attempting a balanced treatment of all Members, as reflected in the 2003 TA Plan, reasonable flexibility needed to be given to the treatment of the ad hoc requests, as long as the human resources were available in the Secretariat. However, an alternative solution existed if the human resources were not available in the Secretariat. An example was when the Government of China had requested an ad hoc national seminar on services in 2002 which had been financed by third party resources. That request had been turned down by the WTO Secretariat because of human resource constraints. However, while turning it down, the Secretariat had proposed other possible experts. That was a way of assisting Members when the human resources of the Secretariat were lacking.","WTCOMTDM44.pdf","China, LDCs, Members, WTO, WTO, Members, Members, Members, Member, Member, WTO, Members, WTO, China, Government, of, China, Members, Secretariat, Secretariat, China, WTO, Secretariat, Secretariat, Members, Secretariat"
"4761",4761,"57","57.      The representative of Tunisia said that the first table of the review of the 2002 TA Plan (WT/COMTD/W/101/Add.4) showed that the African region had the lowest implementation rate. In that context he asked how the Secretariat intended to follow up on the activities that had not been undertaken in 2002 and for which funds had already been allocated. His delegation attached importance to the implementation of those activities as his delegation had based its requests on real and urgent needs, in particular following the large range of issues treated in the Doha Development Agenda. He drew the Secretariat's attention to the fact that the national activities related to services and agriculture undertaken in 2002 mentioned on pages 7 and 43 of document WT/COMTD/W/101/Add.4 did not relate to the 2002 TA Plan but rather to the JITAP programme. The financial burden of those activities had been born by the Government of Tunisia. With respect to outsourcing he said that, as attendance at WTO meetings was restricted to a few people, it limited the knowledge outside consultants had of the negotiation process. It was therefore important to be careful when outsourcing in order to ensure the quality of the TA provided. He said that it had to be ensured that any outsourcing was done in a fair manner to consultants representing all WTO Members. His delegation would come forward with specific comments on the trade policy clinics once the Secretariat had issued a detailed report on the issue. He drew the Committee's attention to the fact that results of national studies had not been implemented. That was particularly true for the needs that the Government of Tunisia had in terms of Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures.","WTCOMTDM44.pdf","Tunisia, Secretariat, Doha, Development, Agenda, Secretariat, Tunisia, WTO, WTO, Members, Secretariat, Committee, Tunisia"
"4760",4760,"56","56.     The representative of Mauritius said that while the reported implementation rates at national and regional levels were impressive, it was important for Members to get a proper evaluation as mentioned by the delegations of Canada and the United States. His Government had benefited both at the regional and at the national levels. The activities carried out in Mauritius had also been audited and that audit should reveal some of the good work that had been done. The representative of Barbados had raised concerns about the ad hoc activities. It was the high share of ad hoc activities compared to planned activities that worried delegations as it raised questions with respect to the predictability and continuity of the TA Plans. He shared the views expressed by other delegations                                                                                     WT/COMTD/M/44                                                                                            Page 19 that, when outsourcing it was important to utilize resources from accredited institutions in various regions, especially local universities and other trade institutions in developing countries. With respect to the trade policy clinics he said that his delegation looked forward to the report that the Secretariat would provide to Members. He hoped that the trade policy clinics would bring additional value to what was already being done. The efficiency and results of the 2002 TA Plan would only be gauged after the full evaluation report had been provided. He thanked the Government of Australia for its contribution to the DDAGTF and said that he hoped that other Members would follow that initiative.","WTCOMTDM44.pdf","Mauritius, Members, Canada, United, States, Mauritius, Barbados, Secretariat, Members, Australia, Members"

The representative of Australia said that her delegation particularly welcomed the information from the Secretariat regarding the acknowledgement of the special needs faced by small islands economies in the South Pacific. Her delegation noted the helpful comments made by the representatives of Barbados and Japan with respect to that issue. She said that the information provided in document WT/COMTD/W/101/Add.4 would serve as a useful complement to the findings of the TA Audit and the full evaluation, when it became available. She said that the Australian Government had announced, on 12 February 2003, that it would contribute a further $A 500,000 to the DDAGTF for TA in 2003. Her Government hoped that that contribution would contribute to efforts to put developing countries in the best position possible to take advantage of the opportunities that the Doha Development Round had to offer.","WTCOMTDM44.pdf","Australia, Secretariat, South, Pacific, Barbados, Japan, TA, Audit, Doha, Development, Round"
"4758",4758,"54","54.      The representative of the European Communities said that his delegation was interested in the evaluation that would be carried out on the 2002 TA Plan. It also had an interest in getting more information on the inter-relationship between the activities implemented and the financial and human resources deployed. On the question of outsourcing he said that his delegation looked forward to an opportunity to consider the outsourcing plan that the Secretariat was working on. Outsourcing was important to enable successful delivery of the 2003 TA Plan and future plans, given the resource constraints faced by the Secretariat, the difference in competence in various areas between the WTO Secretariat and other agencies, and the possible scope to utilise more local and regional delivery mechanisms. The DDAGTF was important and Members had to revert to it in the future on the basis of ideas and papers that would be forthcoming from the Secretariat. On the issue of trade policy clinics he said that he hoped that the Secretariat would soon present its ideas in writing. It was important to get the links between the trade policy clinics and other diagnostic processes right at the international inter-agency level and in the recipient countries. The resource implications of the trade policy clinics would have to be considered. It was also important to integrate the idea of the trade policy clinics into future TA programmes. He understood the idea that in order for the trade policy clinics to be effective they would have to respond to urgent needs of Members and that they therefore, in some sense, were impossible to predict. However, if Members were to do their TA work well, those elements would have to be considered and be integrated into the exercise. His delegation envisaged a continuous process of improvement in terms of programming, coordination and delivery of TA. That process of improvement had to be kept in mind when considering what had been achieved in 2002; what was being achieved in 2003; and to consider what could be done better in the future. It was not premature to begin to consider the strategy for coming years.","WTCOMTDM44.pdf","European, Communities, Secretariat, Secretariat, WTO, Secretariat, Members, Secretariat, Secretariat, Members, Members"

The representative of Morocco said that his delegation supported the general orientation outlined by the Secretariat to achieve a real strengthening of the capacities of developing countries WT/COMTD/M/44 Page 18 and LDCs. The strengthening of capacities was a complex process which demanded an integrated approach. His delegation believed that the 2003 TA Plan, which had been qualitatively improved, would contribute even more to enhanced specialization, and involvement of regional academic institutions. The first experiences in that respect had been gained from the regional trade policy courses in Africa and he was pleased to hear that those courses would be continued and extended to other regions. Such initiatives had to be taken in collaboration with other institutions with relevant experience. Similar to other delegations, he had some questions with respect to the trade policy clinics, and especially with regard to the recommendations that might come from those clinics. He suggested that it might be useful to learn from other organizations who had experience in capacity building in the trade field. ITC and UNCTAD with its Trade Point Programme had already used the trade clinic concept.","WTCOMTDM44.pdf","Morocco, Secretariat, LDCs, Africa, ITC, UNCTAD, Trade, Point, Programme"
"4756",4756,"52","52.      The representative of Bangladesh said that, if statistics were an indicator of the success of any TA Plan, then there was no reason for Members to be unhappy as 90 per cent of the planned national and 95 per cent of the planned regional activities had been implemented. However, whether they had built capacity in the beneficiary countries was a different question. The information was provided by region and by subject matter. That format made it difficult to get an overview of the amount of TA provided to the LDCs. He asked what the rational of the format was and whether the Secretariat could accommodate the LDC category within that format. The listing of activities was also important to understand the kind of TA provided. It was also important for Members to understand who the lead agency was in the delivery of each particular activity. He had found at least two activities to which the WTO had been invited but for which the WTO had not been the main organizer, like the LDC Ministerial Conference in Benin and the WIPO seminar in Bangladesh. The former had been organized by the United Nations and the latter by WIPO. He said that it would assist Members if the listing of activities could be made more focused and include information regarding which activities the WTO had actually organized itself and which activities the WTO had been invited to but which mainly had been organized by other organizations. The WTO should cooperate with other agencies to facilitate the delivery of TA activities. However, 122 activities had had to be cancelled for a variety of reasons in 2002. One of the reasons mentioned was problems in the joint delivery with other agencies. That had been particularly difficult in relation to the Integrated Framework (IF). Although a different fora existed where issues related to the IF could be discussed he asked the Secretariat to inform Members about the type of problems associated with the delivery of the IF.","WTCOMTDM44.pdf","Bangladesh, Members, Secretariat, Members, WTO, WTO, Benin, WIPO, Bangladesh, United, Nations, WIPO, Members, WTO, WTO, WTO, Secretariat, Members"
"4755",4755,"51","51.     He went on to say that the hoped that the process for establishing guidelines for outsourcing would be transparent. His delegation would comment on the guidelines when a draft note was presented to Members. Regarding the modalities of the trade policy clinics, he said that his delegation was pleased to hear that their administrative design was going to be light. However, when the Secretariat presented Members with ideas in writing he hoped that that paper would include the administrative implications of the trade policy clinics. Since many developing country Members faced difficulties in utilizing certain special and differential treatment (S&D) provisions in different agreements, he believed that the trade policy clinics might respond to questions regarding how Members might make use of S&D provisions. It was important to identify the key needs of developing countries and it might be possible to do that through the trade policy clinics. A feedback system should therefore be included in any document produced by the Secretariat. Lastly, he said that his delegation was aware of the specific difficulties faced by small island Members and that there had been a request for more countries to be considered as countries from a region constituting a special challenge. However, the formula was not important. What was important was the content and substance of the activities. Some input from the Dedicated Session on Small Economies would be necessary to identify the common needs of the Members who faced special challenges. Regional experts might also be able to provide information on the special challenges faced by those Members.","WTCOMTDM44.pdf","Members, Secretariat, Members, Members, Members, Secretariat, Members, Members, Members"
"4754",4754,"50","50.      The representative of Japan said that individual issues had been raised in the discussions on the 2003 TA Plan had been raised in order to ensure the best use of the limited resources available, without affecting the quality or the number of activities when implementing the 2003 TA Plan. His delegation therefore agreed that each activity implemented would have to be coherent with the 2003 TA Plan. Regarding the activities implemented in 2002 in cooperation with other organizations he said that document WT/COMTD/W/101/Add.4 showed that some activities had not been implemented due to a lack of resources on the part of the organization the WTO was cooperating with. That document also showed that there had been a rather high number of ad hoc activities. The Secretariat had said that the number of ad hoc activities would be reduced to within 5 per cent in 2003. He was raising that issue because his Government would be contributing to the implementation of the 2003 TA Plan in two spheres. First, it had and would be contributing to the DDAGTF. In 2002, his Government had contributed CHF 600,000. In addition to that, he said that he was pleased to announce an additional contribution by the Government of Japan CHF 210,000 to the DDAGTF. His Government therefore sought modalities by which its development agencies could cooperate with the WTO in implementing the WTO technical cooperation activities. That was the second sphere in which his Government would be contributing. However, it was a difficult one due to the different fiscal year applied in Japan. The development cooperation projects of the Government of Japan were developed with a different time frame. It was therefore difficult for his Government to incorporate its                                                                                      WT/COMTD/M/44                                                                                             Page 17 activities into the WTO TA Plans.                 One example was found on page 24 of document WT/COMTD/W/101/Add.4. At the bottom of the column there was an activity entitled ""WTO-UNCTAD-JICA Workshop on the Relationship between Trade and Investment"". JICA stood for Japan International Cooperation Agency. That activity had been categorized as an ad hoc activity. However, that activity did not change the original purpose or shape of the 2003 TA Plan. His Government had simply attempted to add its resources for WTO TA activities. The original target countries had not been changed. Although his delegation did not wish to see a high level of ad hoc activities, there was a need to make some room for such activities as they could reduce the costs borne by the Secretariat and could provide beneficiary countries with opportunities to participate in the meeting of the Working Group on the Relationship between Trade and Investment, held back-to-back with the above-mentioned workshop. He said that he wished to draw Members' attention to the positive aspects of such activities for Members to continue to arrange for such activities in the future.","WTCOMTDM44.pdf","Japan, WTO, Secretariat, Japan, WTO, WTO, Japan, Japan, WTO, JICA, Japan, International, Cooperation, Agency, WTO, Secretariat, Members, Members"

They came from the League of Arab States, OPEC, the Gulf Organization for Industrial Consulting, the Organisation Internationale de la Francophonie, and from the Common Fund for Commodities. The positions of delegations were well- known and on the record. He proposed that, if there had not been any recent change in Members' positions, the Committee would revert to those requests at its next formal meeting.","WTCOMTDM44.pdf","Chairman, Committee, OPEC, Gulf, Organization, for, Industrial, Consulting, Organisation, Internationale, de, la, Francophonie, Members, Committee"
"4752",4752,"49","49.      The representative of India said that his delegation looked forward to the full Audit of the TA activities carried out in 2002 and the note on the trade policy clinics. He said that it would be useful for Members to get the note on the trade policy clinics in advance of the next meeting of the Committee for Members to have time to study it and contribute to the initiative by the Director-General. He asked whether the Secretariat intended to circulate a draft note on outsourcing. If not, he said that it would help delegations if they could get a written copy of the ideas outlined orally by the Secretariat in order for Members to study them further and send them to their capitals. His delegation welcomed the comments made by the representative of Barbados regarding linkages with regional academic institutions in the context of the overall TA Plan and with respect to outsourcing in particular. An important element of the TA Plan was to strengthen the capacity of existing academic institutions which could provide long-term assistance to their governments and stakeholders. Various delegations had mentioned a number of points relating to the need for better delivery of the TA Plan and enhanced coordination. In that context he referred to 43rd Session of the Committee at which it had been agreed that all issues relating to technical cooperation would be considered early in 2003. It had been noted that such a consideration would not be made with the intention to micromanage WTO TA activities but rather to provide broad guidelines and to ensure that WTO TA activities met the needs of the recipient Members. His delegation hoped that Members could have such a discussion at the next meeting of the Committee while considering all the notes promised by the Secretariat on various aspects of the 2002 and 2003 TA Plans. Footnote 1 of document WT/COMTD/W/104/Add.2 on the 2003 ""Outreach Activities"" was also relevant in that context. It stated that ""Within the context of a full review of technical assistance and capacity building, a decision will be taken on the inclusion of such regional activities in technical assistance and capacity building for subsequent years."" With respect to the document containing information on the implementation of WTO TA activities in 2002 (WT/COMTD/W/101/Add.4) he said that two activities relating to investment were listed as having been held in India during the same period of time. It seemed to his delegation that that was one and the same activity. He therefore asked the Secretariat to verify that and, if necessary, issue a corresponding corrigendum.","WTCOMTDM44.pdf","India, Members, Committee, for, Members, Director-General, Secretariat, Secretariat, Members, Barbados, Committee, WTO, WTO, Members, Members, Committee, Secretariat, WTO, India, Secretariat"
"4751",4751,"48","48.     The Secretariat (Mr. Paul Rolian, Director, Technical Cooperation Division) said that one delegation had raised the question of whether there was a way of knowing what percentage of the TA requests made for 2002 had actually been met. That was unfortunately not possible as the procedures with the 2002 TA Plan had been different from those for the 2003 TA Plan. The 2002 process had been a consultative one in which the Secretariat had received inputs from Members and Committees before producing the 2002 TA Plan. However, the Secretariat did not have a list of 2002 TA requests by Members as it had for the 2003 TA Plan. It was correct that the Budget Committee had received some documentation with respect to the TA budget. The yearly budget estimates in the Burgundy Book contained a report on the work days spent on TA by each Division. That would give Members an idea of the proportion of staff time that was spent on TA. However, the Technical Cooperation Division would attempt to put some useful information together for the delegations of the United States and Canada who had requested it. Regarding the fact that some ad hoc activities had been carried out in places where there had been full implementation of the TA requested, he said that there was no perfect correlation between the activities requested and the activities received on the one hand, and the need to carry out additional activities which could not be foreseen when the requests WT/COMTD/M/44 Page 16 were made, on the other. The Secretariat would consider how to correlate the content of the TA database with what it reported back to Members. The TA Audit had mentioned last year that it was important to have a critical mass of information in order to make a sensible assessment of the overall TA delivery. That was why the WTO TA Audit had undertaken to provide the CTD with an annual report on the TA activities carried out. However, that did not mean that the Secretariat would not take lessons learnt in the context of the activities reported on in the quarterly reports into account, or not seek Members' guidance if issues arose during the implementation.","WTCOMTDM44.pdf","Secretariat, Paul, Rolian, Director, Technical, Cooperation, Division, Secretariat, Members, Secretariat, Members, Budget, Committee, Members, Technical, Cooperation, Division, United, States, Canada, Secretariat, Members, TA, Audit, WTO, TA, Audit, CTD, Secretariat, Members"
"4750",4750,"47","47.      He further referred to the comments made by the representative of Barbados and said that a note on the trade policy clinics would be circulated before the next regular meeting of the CTD, after having incorporated some of the suggestions that had been made by delegations. He concurred with the importance of including regional experts and regional academic institutions when the Secretariat considered the issue of outsourcing. The regional trade policy courses being held in Africa, and soon to be held in the Caribbean and in Asia, would be one way of building regional institutional capacity. That was a first way to use regional experts. He agreed that ad hoc activities could be useful, but trade clinics were another useful and important initiative. The Secretariat would continue to be guided by Members with respect to how such clinics might be requested and how they would be applied. With respect to the strategic vision and priorities mentioned by the representative of the United States in the context of the guidelines for the DDAGTF, he said that the Secretariat would be guided by any comments made by the Members. The concept of trade policy clinics was an evolving idea, for which some key elements had been introduced and on which Members' feedback would be important for the idea to be operationalized. With respect to comments on the content of the quarterly reports he informed Members that back-to-office reports from all the activities undertaken already existed. Those were useful in terms of evaluating the individual activities. The monthly meetings of the Secretariat-wide Technical Assistance Management Committee reviewed activities and aimed at increasing coherence and improving internal Secretariat coordination in the TA delivery. The back- to-office reports also guided the WTO TA Audit. It would be useful to consider new modes of delivery as suggested by the representative of the United States. The Secretariat had access to different toolkits for negotiations. It was considering different proposals and welcomed any further proposals by Members which could improve the delivery of TA.","WTCOMTDM44.pdf","Barbados, CTD, Secretariat, Africa, Caribbean, Asia, Secretariat, Members, United, States, Secretariat, Members, Members, Members, Technical, Assistance, Management, Committee, Secretariat, WTO, TA, Audit, United, States, Secretariat, Members"

The Secretariat (DDG Dr. Ali Rana) thanked Members for their useful comments and important questions which would assist the Secretariat in meeting some of the commitments undertaken. He informed the representative of Djibouti, who had asked about future TA Plans, that although the Secretariat was in the process of implementing the 2003 TA Plan, it would soon begin to consult with Members on the 2004 TA Plan to ensure an early start in the preparations for the coming year. The Secretariat would continue to consult with Members on its TA activities. He encouraged                                                                                    WT/COMTD/M/44                                                                                           Page 15 Members to send their regional representatives to such consultative meetings during which delegations could work together with the Secretariat in planning the activities to be carried out in 2004. The representative of Senegal had posed a question regarding the relationship between the trade policy reviews and the trade policy clinics. Trade policy reviews assisted Members with some of their diagnostic work since many years back. That was the type of work the trade policy clinics could also elaborate on. With respect to the request for TA in the area of technical barriers to trade, the Secretariat would be guided by Members needs. If that was one of the issues of concern to the Government of Senegal and if it submitted a request to the WTO Secretariat, such a request would be considered. The whole concept of trade policy clinics was being developed and was not yet at a stage where it had been operationalized. The Secretariat would issue a note on the trade policy clinics before the next regular meeting of the CTD. Regarding the appeal by the representatives of Canada and the United States to use the TA database, he encouraged the donors to provide more information to the database. The Secretariat was also of the view that it was an important tool for eliminating duplication and an important source of information for all Members. The more statistics provided to it, the more useful it would become.","WTCOMTDM44.pdf","Secretariat, Ali, Rana, Members, Secretariat, Djibouti, Secretariat, Members, Secretariat, Members, Members, Secretariat, Senegal, Members, Secretariat, Members, Senegal, WTO, Secretariat, Secretariat, CTD, Canada, United, States, Secretariat, Members"
"4748",4748,"45","45.      She went on to say that her delegation was interested in the evolution of the ideas of trade policy clinics. There had been a lot of debate on what some Members thought to be an excessive number of ad hoc activities. However, that was understandable given the fact that the number of activities to be delivered had increased in 2002. The trade policy clinics could help to retain a certain amount of flexibility in the process, while at the same time ensuring that the agreed TA Plan would remain the principal focus of Members. Her delegation was concerned about how the trade policy clinics would be built into the 2003 TA Plan as they had not been budgeted for, and looked forward to hearing how the Secretariat proposed to resolve that. She asked whether it would be possible for the Secretariat to build in the qualitative aspects of TA into the quarterly reports that the Secretariat would provide. For example, she suggested that the quarterly reports include summaries of the questionnaires that the participants in activities had to fill out at the end of seminars. That would respond to questions such as whether the participants felt that the activity was useful and whether they would have preferred another mode of delivery. Building in some kind of ongoing qualitative assessment of the activities recently undertaken would be useful in order for the TA Plans to be fine- tuned while they were being implemented. She said that her last point related to new modes of delivery of TA. Some delegations had previously indicated that WTO TA delivery was too concentrated on seminars. She suggested that modern information technology be utilised more. A big network of on-line learning was available that the WTO might learn from and a component of on-line learning might be built into the WTO TA Plan. Given the resource constraints of the Secretariat, her delegation suggested that the Secretariat consider alternative approaches to TA delivery. She supported the suggestion made by the representative of Canada to integrate the TA database with the ongoing delivery of WTO TA. It was important to ensure that that database was used.","WTCOMTDM44.pdf","Members, Members, Secretariat, Secretariat, Secretariat, WTO, WTO, WTO, Secretariat, Secretariat, Canada, WTO, TA"
"4747",4747,"44","44.      The representative of the United States said that her delegation welcomed the suggestion made by the representative of Canada that it would be useful for Members if future documentation could provide more information on the human as well as the financial resources used in implementing the TA Plans. She was aware of the fact that the Budget Committee had received information on the budgetary aspects. However, having information on both the budgetary and the human resources used would help Members understand the WTO TA requirements. She said that her delegation was interested in outsourcing as it was concerned about the ability of the Secretariat to deliver effectively on the large number of activities foreseen during 2003. The implementation of the 2003 Programme had begun late as it had taken time for Members to agree to the 2003 TA Plan. During the preparations of the 2003 TA Plan, delegations had known that some time would be lost in the run up to the Cancún Ministerial Conference when delegations would be preoccupied in negotiations. Outsourcing was therefore also time sensitive. The delivery of the activities planned for 2003 had to be undertaken, preferably at an accelerated pace, to enable the Secretariat to deliver on the entire 2003 TA Plan. It would be helpful to consider the use of regional expertise as suggested by the representative of Barbados. With respect to the guidelines for the DDAGTF, she said that her delegation appreciated the thoughts outlined by the Secretariat on the administrative questions such as the scope of access. However, she had not heard anything about the strategic vision and the TA priorities. She asked how Members collectively could define the key activities that met the needs of the Doha Development Round and identify, from a broader point of view, what Members' priorities were. Once that work was done, Members would have a sense of what WTO TA was meant to achieve. That would assist Members in considering future TA plans from a broader perspective, and not only respond to individual TA requests. WTO TA was at an early stage of being built up. It would therefore be useful to have a discussion on the strategic vision for WTO TA and its priorities in connection with the drawing up of the guidelines for the DDAGTF.","WTCOMTDM44.pdf","United, States, Canada, Members, Budget, Committee, Members, WTO, Secretariat, Members, Cancún, Ministerial, Conference, Secretariat, Barbados, Secretariat, Members, Members, Members, WTO, Members, WTO, WTO"
"4746",4746,"43","43.      The representative of Barbados welcomed the creativeness that the Secretariat had shown to ensure successful delivery of the 2003 and future TA Plans. Because TA was of primary importance to her Government and a necessary tool for developing country Members, her delegation welcomed the possibility of increased use of outside consultants. Her delegation recognized the challenges of having consultants from outside the WTO deliver a message from the WTO. Nevertheless, it was important to attempt to respond to as many TA needs as possible. She therefore encouraged the Secretariat to elaborate ways to source competent experts. Her delegation was interested in having a closer look at the guidelines that the Secretariat was elaborating. Whatever criteria used for the identification of consultants, it should include the consideration of regional experts. There was an interesting linkage between identification of regional consultants and the initiative carried out by the WTO Training Institute to create relationships with regional academic institutions. The WTO Secretariat would become more familiar with regional experts through a strengthening of those relationships. She urged the Secretariat to continue to consider experts outside the ambit of former staff members and former Ambassadors as Members who had not had their nationals serve as regular WTO Secretariat staff would otherwise be at a disadvantage. Her delegation believed that the trade policy clinics seemed to be useful. It was necessary to maintain the flexible nature of the initiative. Concerns had previously been expressed from within the Secretariat and by some Members about the number of ad hoc activities. Her delegation had nevertheless expressed the view that there was a need for a certain amount of flexibility. She said that she looked forward to more information about the trade policy clinics, and especially on how they would be requested and to what extent they would influence the Secretariat's assessment of Member's TA requests. She asked whether there would be a formal linkage between the trade policy clinics and Member's TA requests and said that, if that was the case, there should be a more widespread use of the trade policy clinics. She welcomed the Secretariat's decision to accommodate the request made by the delegations of Australia and New Zealand for a recognition of the small island states of the Pacific as a region with special challenges. The Caribbean had also rightly been recognized as such a region. That recognition for the small island states of the Pacific was welcome as small island developing states had special needs and specific vulnerabilities which required focussed responses. Such sensitisation among the Secretariat and Members was necessary.

"4745",4745,"42","42.      The representative of Canada said that the her delegation was pleased to see that the Secretariat had been able to deliver on 92 per cent of the planned activities. That was an impressive percentage given that the delivery of TA was additional to other roles the Secretariat had to play. Her delegation was awaiting the document on trade policy clinics in order to review that initiative more closely before commenting on it. She asked what percentage of requests for TA the Secretariat had fulfilled in 2002. Her delegation regretted that the report had neither provided the costing nor an indication of the human resource requirements for the delivery of the activities. She therefore asked whether that information would be included in the evaluation by the Technical Cooperation Audit which her delegation was eager to receive. She asked how many of the ad hoc activities delivered in 2002 that had been identified as needs by the developing country Members. She noted that some countries and regions had received ad hoc activities although all their planned activities had been delivered. That was true for certain categories of TA. Her delegation therefore hoped that the Secretariat could ensure a proper balance when accepting ad hoc requests in the future. With respect to outsourcing her delegation recognized that the additional stress on the Secretariat's human resources and encouraged the Secretariat to continue to actively seek alternatives in the delivery of future TA in order for it to better concentrate on its own mandate and in order for Secretariat staff not to face undue hardship with respect to their workload. In order to properly track the fulfilment of the Doha Ministerial commitments on TA and capacity building, her delegation encouraged the use of the categories used in the trade-related TA and capacity building database in the TA reports.","WTCOMTDM44.pdf","Canada, Secretariat, Secretariat, Secretariat, Members, Secretariat, Secretariat, Secretariat, TA, Secretariat"
"4744",4744,"41","41.      The representative of Senegal said that his delegation continued to believe that TA was at the heart of the Doha Development Agenda. The issue of TA therefore merited Members' attention. The had presented new ideas for TA which his delegation hoped would be put into practice. He said that he had a question with respect to the trade policy clinics and their relationship to the Trade Policy Reviews. He asked if the idea was that the trade policy clinics would complement the Trade Policy Reviews if the Trade Policy Reviews revealed deficiencies in the trade policies of developing countries, or, whether the trade policy clinics were something distinct from, but parallel to, the Trade Policy Reviews. If so, he asked if developing countries Members would have to request trade policy clinics in particular sectors. All Members were concerned that duplication had to be avoided and that the available resources were concentrated in the most important areas. There had been needs assessments in areas such as technical barriers to trade and almost all developing countries had responded. If the idea of trade policy clinics was to be upheld, he suggested that it would make operational sense to begin in an area such as technical barriers to trade where practically every developing country Member encountered difficulties. He asked whether it would be possible to consider the needs assessment of each developing country Government and attempt to respond to the needs expressed. He had been told that the WTO Secretariat would attempt to guide Members                                                                                     WT/COMTD/M/44                                                                                            Page 13 towards different other international organizations depending on the types of needs Governments identified. However, Members knew that there were coordination and follow-up problems in developing countries.","WTCOMTDM44.pdf","Senegal, Doha, Development, Agenda, Members, Members, Members, Member, WTO, Secretariat, Members, Members"
"4743",4743,"40","40.      The representative of Djibouti said that his Government had benefited from TA since 1998/1999 when the first French regional seminars had been held. Since then, one or two seminars had been organized each year. His Government had thus benefited from both regional and national events. A seminar had been held a few weeks earlier on trade and investment in cooperation with UNCTAD. That seminar had been a real success and the Minister of Trade of Djibouti had addressed a letter of congratulations to the Director-General. The two organizations had complemented each other well and the participants in that activity had written a joint communiqué requesting that that type of seminar be held on a regular basis. The Government of Djibouti had both attempted to evaluate its needs and follow-up to the training provided. He asked what new elements Members were looking for in terms of follow-up and evaluation. He asked whether there would be new methods or a new team of staff. It became increasingly difficult to provide technical assistance as the themes discussed within the WTO broadened. When the WTO had come into existence a certain number of activities had been carried out per year. However, the number of activities had increased many times since then. There had to be realistic expectations on WTO TA activities. Many of the WTO staff Members knew the problems and needs of the developing country WTO Members. It was nevertheless important that the WTO Secretariat collaborated with other organisations which had more experience than the WTO in certain areas. Collaboration with other agencies would complement the knowledge of WTO staff. He knew of successful collaboration between the WTO and ITC, UNCTAD and the World Customs Organization. If the Secretariat considered changes to its delivery of technical assistance, such changes would therefore have to be well thought through.","WTCOMTDM44.pdf","Djibouti, UNCTAD, Djibouti, Director-General, Djibouti, Members, WTO, WTO, WTO, WTO, Members, WTO, Members, WTO, Secretariat, WTO, WTO, WTO, ITC, UNCTAD, World, Customs, Organization, Secretariat"

"4741",4741,"39","39.     The Secretariat went on to the seventh and final commitment made by the Secretariat in connection with the 2003 TA Plan which was to accommodate the suggestion for small island countries in the Pacific to also be considered as countries from a region constituting a special challenge along with other countries already referred to as such in the draft 2003 TA Plan (WT/COMTD/W/104/Rev.1). That request had been made by the delegations of Australia and New Zealand. The Secretariat had accommodated that request in the second revision of the 2003 TA Plan, dated 10 December 2002 (WT/COMTD/W/104/Rev.2). The specific revision was contained in Chapter X, Section D, paragraph 42 on page 17 of the English version.","WTCOMTDM44.pdf","Secretariat, Secretariat, Pacific, Australia, New, Zealand, Secretariat"
"4740",4740,"383","383. Furthermore, a total of 134 ad hoc activities had been carried out in 2002, which, in terms of the number of activities undertaken, represented 27 per cent of the 488 activities undertaken in 2002. In terms of cost however, those activities represented less than half that percentage since, in most instances, the only costs incurred were those related to the participation of WTO staff. Table I of document WT/COMTD/W/101/Add.4 contained a breakdown of activities by region and table II a breakdown of activities by subject matter. In that context, he said that the Secretariat had made every effort to implement the priorities set by Members, both in terms of regions and in terms of subjects, without prejudice to the global coverage of its TA activities. With respect to the implementation of Members' commitments on technical cooperation and capacity building contained in the Doha Ministerial Declaration, he recalled the Director-General's interim report (WT/GC/W/484) to the General Council in December 2002, in pursuance of the mandate contained in paragraph 41 of the Doha Ministerial Declaration.","WTCOMTDM44.pdf","WTO, Secretariat, Members, Members, Director-General, General, Council"
"4739",4739,"38","38.      Fourth, he said that the clinics would be light in administrative design, flexible and quick to react to the needs of Members. The Secretariat did not intend to create another layer of technical assistance. Existing Secretariat mechanisms should be used, to the extent possible, to coordinate, administer and deliver trade policy clinics. Fifth, the clinics would mainly be about diagnosis and prescription. Upon request, a trade policy clinic would study the problem/s identified by the Member and provide a diagnosis of what needed to be done. In other words, trade policy clinics would be an important preliminary component of a technical assistance programme. In that regard, the trade policy clinics should not be viewed as a stand-alone product but as an integral part of the WTO technical assistance and capacity building programme. Sixth, the Secretariat expected trade policy clinics to involve, not only the WTO Secretariat, but also other international organisations which might have particular expertise relevant to the needs of the Member in question. For example, if a Member requested expertise on customs or intellectual property-related matters, the delegation to address such concerns could comprise staff from the World Customs Organization (WCO) or the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) or related bodies. That would be an important opportunity to build coherence with other international organisations and mobilise their resources and knowledge. Seventh, in light of the constraints on Secretariat resources some prioritisation of the beneficiaries of the trade policy clinics would be required. The Secretariat would be guided by the Members in that respect. In addition, the Secretariat could only respond positively to a request to WT/COMTD/M/44 Page 12 establish a trade policy clinic, if it had the resources to do so. In that regard, it might be productive to consider a regional approach to the clinics, particularly in cases where several countries in a region shared similar problems or concerns. There were clearly a number of practical and operational questions that would need to be answered. The Secretariat hoped to be able to circulate an information note on the trade policy clinics in the near future. He said that it would be useful at that stage to hear Members' preliminary views on those ideas, as that input would help the Secretariat shape the initiative and ensure that it effectively met the needs of the Members.","WTCOMTDM44.pdf","Members, Secretariat, Secretariat, Member, WTO, Secretariat, WTO, Secretariat, Member, Member, World, Customs, Organization, WCO, World, Intellectual, Property, Organization, WIPO, Secretariat, Secretariat, Members, Secretariat, Secretariat, Members, Secretariat, Members"
"4738",4738,"37","37.      He continued by saying that the sixth commitment made by the Secretariat in connection with the 2003 TA Plan was to circulate an information note on ""Trade Clinics"" and further consult with Members on their modalities. The Secretariat was in the process of elaborating the concept of ""trade clinics"". The Director-General had introduced the idea of establishing ""trade clinics"" to assist Members address particular problems. The Director-General had a precise idea of the direction he wished the initiative to take. First, the Secretariat had refined the scope of the initiative from ""trade clinics"" to ""trade policy clinics"". The purpose of the trade policy clinics was to provide Members with a one-stop service to answer urgent questions concerning their trade policies and practices. A Member seeking that service would receive a diagnosis of the trade issues of concern to it and practical recommendations on how they might be addressed. It was envisaged that the clinics would help fill in any gap in planned TA activities, and help answer the types of questions that were not covered by present WTO activities. It would also provide the Secretariat with a mechanism to respond quickly and flexibly to urgent TA needs over the course of the year. Second, there would be a coherent link between the trade policy clinics and the existing technical assistance and capacity building activities. There were already numerous activities that addressed some of the concerns. The clinics would help avoid duplication and optimise the use of scarce Secretariat resources. In addition, as part of a coherent framework for technical cooperation and capacity building, the results of the trade policy clinics would feed back into the regular WTO technical assistance programme and help ensure that WTO activities were well targeted and meaningful. Third, related to the point on coherence, the Secretariat already had experience in evaluating trade policies and practises, particularly through Trade Policy Reviews. The trade policy clinics would utilise that expertise and, as far as possible, build synergies with the Trade Policy Reviews. That was already happening in some cases. The Trade Policy Review Division continued to receive requests from Members to discuss the results of their TPRs. The clinics could help coordinate, systematize and extend that growing demand for Secretariat expertise in diagnostic and prescriptive trade policy work.","WTCOMTDM44.pdf","Secretariat, Members, Secretariat, Director-General, Members, Director-General, Secretariat, Members, Member, WTO, Secretariat, Secretariat, WTO, WTO, Secretariat, Trade, Policy, Review, Division, Members, Secretariat"
"4737",4737,"36","36.      The Secretariat further provided Members with some elements for an initial discussion in the Committee on the fifth commitment, which was to review, together with Members, the underlying terms of reference of the DDAGTF, including issues of access to the Fund and its management. He started by referring to Annex B of document WT/BFA/56 of 18 December 2001 of the Committee on Budget, Finance and Administration (the Budget Committee). That Annex reported on the deliberations of Members in the Budget Committee and provided some guidance on the operation of the DDAGTF. The Secretariat was guided by what Members had asked it to do. He recalled that it was clearly stated in that document that the purpose of the DDAGTF was to finance technical assistance to developing countries and/or economies in transition, and especially LDCs, in accordance with the commitments made in the Doha Ministerial Declaration and the agreed Co-ordinated WTO Secretariat Annual TA Plan, or responding to the criteria specified in the New WTO Strategy for Technical Cooperation. Access to the Fund should be provided to: LDCs, developing countries, and economies in transition, and to non-residents. Areas and activities to be funded included:                                                                                      WT/COMTD/M/44                                                                                             Page 11 commitments made in the Doha Declaration, activities contained in the TA Plan, activities identified in the Strategy for Technical Cooperation, ""trade policy clinics"" and other activities requested by Members, Geneva based activities, including the Geneva week, or TA activities that were held in Geneva back to back with regular WTO meetings. With respect to cost, the DDAGTF was used to cover all costs related to the effective functioning of the activity, including local administrative costs and costs for simultaneous interpretation for regional seminars, if deemed necessary. The DDAGTF was presently managed by the Technical Co-operation Division (TCD) and the Administration and General Services Division (AGSD), who reported to the Budget Committee in accordance with established financial rules and regulations.","WTCOMTDM44.pdf","Secretariat, Members, Committee, Members, Committee, on, Budget, ,, Finance, and, Administration, Budget, Committee, Members, Budget, Committee, Secretariat, Members, WTO, Secretariat, WTO, Strategy, for, Technical, Cooperation, Members, Geneva, Geneva, Geneva, WTO, Technical, Co-operation, Division, General, Services, Division, AGSD, Budget, Committee"
"4736",4736,"35","35.      He further said that one focus in the work on outsourcing had been on the WTO's relationship with partner institutions. The Secretariat's current policy was reflected in a note on ""Inter-Agency Cooperation: State-of-Play"" dated July 2002 (WT/COMTD/W/102) and in the 2003 Coordinated WTO Secretariat Annual TA Plan (WT/COMTD/W/104/Rev.2). The Secretariat's policy underlined that inter-agency arrangements and strategic partnerships were essential in order to respond fully to the significant technical cooperation mandates in the Doha Ministerial Declaration. Those arrangements were also necessary in areas outside the strict competence of the WTO. The Secretariat had endeavoured over the past 18 months to develop and formalize its cooperation with different partners at the regional and international level in order to respond adequately to the Doha Development Agenda Mandates. That cooperation was generally embodied in MoUs. The Secretariat had also engaged in reformulating existing MoUs to render them relevant to the Doha Development Agenda. In negotiating MoUs or other such arrangements, financing arrangements and cost-sharing ratios had always been a sensitive issue. To date, the Secretariat had insisted on negotiating appropriate cost-sharing arrangements with partners to finance jointly organized activities. The Secretariat was also attentive to the need to preserve the integrity of WTO Members’ negotiating positions. When policy differences arose in negotiations with other institutions, partnerships for capacity building activities were limited to areas of agreement. However, there was need for a clearer policy on the issue, as the MoUs signed with that large network of organisations, agencies and banks were still far from being harmonized. The Secretariat was in the process of preparing a set of guidelines to allow for a more coherent approach to WTO partnerships, whether in terms of financing, capacity building, or sharing of expertise. That would allow the WTO to present its potential partners with one or two standard agreements to serve as a basis for negotiations. The Secretariat had developed standard DDAGTF agreements for Members' funding. The most recent MoUs signed with other organisations fell mainly into two categories. The first was texts where the two parties merely expressed their wish to cooperate in general or on specific matters, but where it was clear that there was no intention to enter into concrete engagements immediately. Such MoUs generally left it to future ""implementing agreements"" to define the precise areas of cooperation and the nature of that cooperation on a case-by-case basis. The second category of MoUs were ""Framework agreements"", where the two parties expressed their wish to co-operate in general or on specific matters and set out the terms of their cooperation in such a way that most of the issues that would be recurrent in the course of the implementation of the framework agreements (e.g., financial arrangements, administrative issues, etc.) were dealt with, leaving only a limited number of questions specific to an activity, to be addressed in each particular case. There was actually a third category of MoUs signed by the WTO earlier, including with the IMF, the World Bank and the World Customs Organization. Those were mandated by the provisions of the WTO agreements, and their negotiation and approval involved WTO Members directly. They each had a format of their own as a result.","WTCOMTDM44.pdf","WTO, Secretariat, WTO, Secretariat, Secretariat, WTO, Secretariat, Doha, Development, Agenda, Mandates, Secretariat, Doha, Development, Agenda, Secretariat, Secretariat, WTO, Members, MoUs, Secretariat, WTO, WTO, Secretariat, Members, MoUs, MoUs, MoUs, MoUs, WTO, IMF, World, Bank, World, Customs, Organization, WTO, WTO, Members"
"4735",4735,"34","34.      The Secretariat went on to provide some statistics regarding the recent practice of outsourcing. The Secretariat had used outside consultants sparingly in the past two years. Nineteen consultants had been used in 2001 for around 40 assignments dealing with 25 technical cooperation and training activities. In 2002, 28 consultants had been used for just over 30 assignments. Those consultants had been drawn from several sources, and included former WTO Secretariat staff, former Ambassadors and academics. Their compensation involved the payment of an honorarium comprising either a fee of CHF 600 per day or a lump sum per assignment negotiated with the WTO division involved. The payment of daily subsistence allowance (DSA) was not automatic, and travel expenses were paid when appropriate. In some cases, only DSA and travel expenses were paid, and the honorarium was waived. As part of the consideration of outsourcing, the Secretariat had drawn up a roster of experts in 2002 on the basis of indications provided by the Membership of names of individuals and their areas of expertise. That roster was being updated and expanded by the Training Institute, with contributions from all divisions, to take account of recent WTO experience in outsourcing to outside consultants. One way to improve the current procedure for hiring outside consultants would be to devise a more elaborate, open and transparent process. Guidelines might be required for establishing a roster of experts and procedures for selecting resource persons, as well as for the proper management of such a roster. The guidelines would also govern overall legal and administrative provisions with regard to the use of outside experts as well as related financial aspects, including consultancy fees, DSA, insurance coverage and travel expenses. The guidelines could also contain provisions regarding an overall assessment of experiences with regard to outsourcing and a related cost/benefit assessment. Such an assessment would also allow for a further refinement of WT/COMTD/M/44 Page 10 relevant provisions, where required. Experts to be considered for inclusion in the roster could include former trade policy officials, former GATT/WTO staff Members, academics, recognised experts in a specific field, trainers, and officials from other international organizations and recognised bodies.","WTCOMTDM44.pdf","Secretariat, Secretariat, WTO, Secretariat, WTO, DSA, DSA, Secretariat, Training, Institute, WTO, DSA, GATT/WTO, Members"
"4734",4734,"33","33.      The Secretariat (DDG Dr. Ali Rana) said that the second commitment also related to the implementation of the 2002 activities. However, in addition to the figures on the activities implemented, Members had also requested the Secretariat to provide a full evaluation of the activities carried out in 2002, by March 2003. In keeping with that undertaking, the Secretariat was preparing the Technical Cooperation Audit Report for 2002, which would be circulated to Members before the end of March 2003. That paper could then be considered at the next meeting of the Committee. Regarding the third commitment, to produce quarterly reports on activities to be carried out in 2003, it was the Secretariat's intention to circulate the first such report by mid-April to cover the first quarter in its entirety. The fourth commitment was to produce a structured plan on how to increase outsourcing to other multilateral institutions. The Secretariat would provide a progress report on the ongoing work undertaken by the Secretariat to consider the possibility of outsourcing technical cooperation activities and to consider preliminary elements of a structured plan on how to increase outsourcing by the use of outside consultants and cooperation with other multilateral institutions. With the ever-increasing demand for technical cooperation activities and the limited resources available during the Doha Development Agenda negotiations, the WTO Secretariat would have to find an adequate balance between time spent on technical cooperation as compared to time devoted to other core activities, such as servicing committees and negotiations in particular. The reports prepared by the Secretariat's 1998 Task Force on Enhanced WTO Technical Cooperation and the 2000 Task Force on Technical Cooperation and Training respectively, were useful starting points for that process which would also build on consultations with interested parties (IGO, academics, former staff and former trade diplomats), before being submitted for Members' consideration in the CTD. As a resource base, outside consultants would constitute a reservoir to which the WTO Secretariat could have recourse to supplement its own limited human resources for technical cooperation/training activities. They would all have to fit carefully constructed profiles in order to be useful in complementing in-house human resources for technical cooperation activities. At the same time, increasing recourse to outside consultants was probably inevitable since the Director-General's recent proposal on increased human resources had met with limited success in the budget process. While the Secretariat had requested 46 new posts in 2003, Members had only agreed to six. The terms of reference of the establishment for the DDAGTF clearly indicated that the Fund could be used for TA activities to be conducted by outside experts if it was deemed necessary. That implied that the Secretariat was fully responsible for the co-ordination and execution of all subcontracted activities.","WTCOMTDM44.pdf","Secretariat, Ali, Rana, Members, Secretariat, Secretariat, Members, Committee, Secretariat, Secretariat, Secretariat, WTO, Secretariat, Secretariat, WTO, Technical, Cooperation, Task, Force, on, Technical, Cooperation, IGO, Members, CTD, WTO, Secretariat, Director-General, Secretariat, Members, Secretariat"
"4733",4733,"32","32.      The Chairman said that the Secretariat had made seven commitments. The first was to provide detailed information on activities carried out in 2002 before the end of February 2003. Document WT/COMTD/W/101/Add.4, which had just been presented to Members, aimed at responding to that commitment. The second commitment was to provide a full evaluation of the activities carried out in 2002, by March 2003. The third commitment was to produce quarterly reports on activities during 2003. The fourth commitment was to produce a structured plan on how to increase outsourcing to other multilateral institutions. The fifth commitment was to review, together with Members, the underlying terms of reference of the Doha Development Agenda Global Trust Fund (DDAGTF), including issues of access to the Fund and its management. The sixth commitment was to circulate an information note on the Trade Clinics and further consult with Members on their modalities. The final commitment was to accommodate the suggestion for small island countries in the Pacific to also be considered as countries from a region constituting a special challenge along with those countries already referred to as such in the draft 2003 TA Plan (WT/COMTD/W/104/Rev.1). As there was an overlap between some of those commitments he suggested that the Secretariat might wish to report on the other commitments as well.

"4732",4732,"31","31.      The representative of the United States said that her delegation noted that the Secretariat planned to provide Members with an evaluation of the 2002 TA Plan in late March 2003. She asked if that was the evaluation referred to in the commitments made by the Secretariat. Her delegation was deeply interested in that evaluation. In the preparations for the 2003 TA Plan there had been a growing sense that Members needed to consider the quality of the activities from the perspective of the beneficiaries, rather than exclusively concentrate on quantity.                        Document WT/COMTD/W/101/Add.4 was useful in terms of defining the scope of the activities, where activities had taken place, and the type of activity delivered. However, she requested the Secretariat to comment on how Members could get a policy assessment of where the greatest utility was found by the beneficiaries and where the beneficiaries thought that there were deficiencies. That type of information would be useful as Members began to consider guidelines for 2004. Her delegation would appreciate if some information on the lessons learned could be included in the periodic reporting on the implementation of the 2003 TA Plan so that those lessons could be incorporated when Members considered the 2004 TA Plan.","WTCOMTDM44.pdf","United, States, Secretariat, Members, Secretariat, Members, Secretariat, Members, Members, Members"
"4731",4731,"30","30.     The Secretariat (Mr. Paul Rolian, Director, Technical Cooperation Division) said that document WT/COMTD/W/101/Add.4 summarized the implementation of TA in 2002. The Secretariat had delivered the largest number of TA activities ever in 2002, i.e. 488 activities, of which 481 had been executed in 2002 and seven in 2003 as roll-over activities. Considerable progress had, WT/COMTD/M/44 Page 8 at the same time, been made in the planning and programming process of the executed activities, since the Secretariat could report an average of 92 per cent implementation of the 2002 TA Plan (90 per cent for national activities and 95 per cent for regional activities). That implementation rate was also the result of the natural evolution of the 2002 TA Plan throughout the year, since, as reported at the 43rd Session of the Committee held in November 2002, 122 activities provided for in the 2002 TA Plan had to be cancelled for a variety of reasons, including cancellation by recipient countries; problems in joint delivery with other Agencies (in particular with respect to the Integrated Framework (IF) and mainstreaming activities); not enough progress to justify the execution of the planned activity (which concerned in particular accessions, negotiating groups, trade negotiation skills); and civil unrest/insecurity. After deducting those activities and the nine entries in the 2002 TA Plan related to the development of tools for TA, the total number of activities in the 2002 TA Plan was","WTCOMTDM44.pdf","Secretariat, Paul, Rolian, Director, Technical, Cooperation, Division, Secretariat, Secretariat, Committee"

"4729",4729,"29","29.     The Secretariat (DDG Dr. Ali Rana) said that, as the Chairman had pointed out, the Secretariat had been asked to make a number of commitments during the discussions on the 2003 TA Plan. Some of those commitments were to be delivered within specific time-frames while no time- frame had been given with respect to the others. He was pleased to report that the Secretariat was working on all of the commitments and that, in that respect, he intended to inform Members about progress on all of them. He said that the Secretariat had actually already delivered on two of them and that he would deal with them in order. The first commitment the Secretariat had fulfilled was to provide detailed information on TA activities carried out in 2002 before the end of February 2003. That commitment, as far as the Secretariat had understood it, related to a desire to get a full picture of the implementation of technical TA activities carried out in 2002. That information had been compiled in document WT/COMTD/W/101/Add.4, which had been circulated to Members prior to the meeting.","WTCOMTDM44.pdf","Secretariat, Ali, Rana, Chairman, Secretariat, Secretariat, Members, Secretariat, Secretariat, Secretariat, Members"

The Committee had, at its 41st session, forwarded notifications from Japan and Switzerland to the Sub-Committee for substantive consideration and reporting back. He noted that the Sub-Committee had reported back on its discussions on the two notifications, in so far as they pertained to LDCs.

"4724",4724,"24","24.      The representative of Canada said that Members' interventions had encouraged his delegation to believe that the initiative was a step in the right direction on what was a long road for all Members. The Government of Canada had been inspired by the initiatives taken by the Governments of the European Communities, the United States and other members' Governments. The Government of Canada had attempted to go even further than those initiatives. Although an initiative could not be judged by only two months of existence, he said that the import statistics of the apparel sector in Canada showed that, in the first two months of 2003 since the initiative came into effect, imports from the LDCs had increased by 16 per cent. That was a positive growth rate. The overall rise in apparel imports into the Canadian market was less than 4 per cent. LDC exports were thus growing four times that rate. That was a sign that the new initiative had the potential to produce good results. The representative of Ethiopia had raised the important point of safeguarding margins of preferences. That had to be carefully considered from a trade-policy perspective. If WTO Members always had to ensure that the current margins of preferences were kept they would never be able to put their tariffs at zero. What had to be done was to find other ways to encourage economic development, and that was exactly what the Government of Canada had attempted to do by introducing the new initiative.                                                                                      WT/COMTD/M/44                                                                                              Page 7 There had been wide public consultations, showing a lot of opposition in Canada, before the Government had taken the initiative. There had even been suggestions to limit the initiative to African beneficiaries following the G8 initiatives for Africa. The proponents of that view had said that there was very little trade between Canada and Africa. Other opponents had claimed that there was no point in taking such an initiative as the quotas would be removed in 2005 as a result of the conclusion of the Doha Round of negotiations. The Government of Canada had nevertheless decided that it was better to take the initiative before the quotas were removed to see if any country could benefit from the initiative in the meantime and possibly even establish itself in the Canadian market. The Government of Canada had also decided to keep the initiative in the WTO context, consistent with the Enabling Clause. However, what was even more important were stable environments in the LDCs, which would encourage investment and open markets, consistent with their own economic needs and social development. The Doha Development Agenda was a fundamental agenda for all Members. All Members needed to work hard to ensure that the Cancún Ministerial Conference became a success.","WTCOMTDM44.pdf","Canada, Members, Members, Canada, European, Communities, United, States, Canada, Canada, LDCs, Ethiopia, WTO, Members, Canada, Canada, Africa, Canada, Africa, Canada, Canada, WTO, Doha, Development, Agenda, Members, Members, Cancún, Ministerial, Conference"

All Members were struggling to find ways to bring more coherence and practical benefits to the LDCs. One of the most important elements that the Government of Canada had decided to grapple with in its new initiative was the South-South component. That component was critical to the success of the Doha Development Round of negotiations, and the work done by the Government of Canada was important in that respect. She also welcomed the signal it sent of political will to move forward.","WTCOMTDM44.pdf","United, States, Canada, Members, Canada, Canada"

His delegation hoped that other Members would take similar initiatives. Nevertheless, his delegation was worried about the inevitable erosion of preferences following the tariff reductions currently being negotiated under the Doha Round of negotiations. His delegation hoped that Members having provided LDC preferences would consider ways of safeguarding preference margins and securing the benefits of the initiatives when the negotiated tariff reductions came into force.","WTCOMTDM44.pdf","Ethiopia, Canada, Members, United, States, Members, Members"

That initiative was important as it included agricultural, textiles, clothing and foot-ware products. Haiti was an LDC in which the processing industry was important. The initiative by the Government of Canada seemed to follow the ""Everything-but-arms"" initiative of the European Communities, but might even go beyond that initiative. He hoped that other members would follow those initiatives to increase duty and quota-free market access for LDC exports, including agricultural, textiles, clothing and foot-ware products. That would enhance the integration of LDCs into the Multilateral Trading System as those products were of primary interest to LDCs.","WTCOMTDM44.pdf","Haiti, Canada, Haiti, LDC, Canada"

Such measures could for example include information sessions in the LDC capitals with the Canadian commercial missions to further explain the new measures. It could also include, within one or two years, an evaluation of the real impact of the initiative on bilateral trade.

"4713",4713,"14","14.      The representative of Bangladesh, speaking on behalf of the LDCs, said that his delegation subscribed to the view that enhanced trade contributed to poverty reduction. On behalf of the LDC Group of countries he extended his gratitude to the Government of Canada for its initiative to provide duty and quota-free access to essentially all imports from LDCs. The new initiative, which had actually been effective from 1 January 2003, added 903 tariff lines to the duty-free tariff items for LDCs. The improved preferential scheme included a wide range of agricultural, textiles, apparel and footwear products. Those products were of critical importance to the LDCs and accounted for a major share of their export earnings. LDCs had been requesting duty and quota-free treatment for their products with relaxed and flexible rules of origin. In fact, enhanced market access through reduced or zero-tariffs was meaningless if access was denied because of non-tariff barriers. He was particularly happy to see that the new measure was accompanied by relaxed rules of origin requirements. The initiative taken by the Canadian Authorities clearly demonstrated the Canadian Government's commitment to the Doha Ministerial Declaration in which Ministers had committed themselves to consider additional measures for progressive market access improvements for LDCs. Meaningful integration of LDCs into the Multilateral Trading System required efforts by all WTO Members. The measures taken by the Government of Canada would encourage other Members to make further improvements to their preferential schemes for LDCs, and thereby fulfill the mandate of the Doha Ministerial Declaration. Measures such as that of the Government of Canada could help arrest the increasing marginalization of the LDCs in international trade. Trade with the Quad countries accounted for more than two-thirds of LDC trade. Canada was thus an important destination for LDC exports. He said that he hoped that the opportunities provided through the new initiative would further boost LDCs' exports to Canada and accelerate economic growth in LDCs. The LDCs looked forward to enhanced cooperation with the Government of Canada.","WTCOMTDM44.pdf","Bangladesh, LDCs, LDC, Group, Canada, LDCs, LDCs, WTO, Members, Canada, Members, Canada, LDC, Canada, Canada, LDCs, Canada"

He finally said that, as the new initiative touched the two sensitive sectors of textiles and apparel, the Government of Canada had to ensure that domestic Canadian interests were adequately taken into account. One other condition for eligibility for duty and quota-free treatment in textiles and apparel was therefore that each LDC sign a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with the Government of Canada. That MoU only required that LDC authorities enable the Canada Customs and Revenue Agency to verify that a product actually qualifies as originating under the LDC initiative when the Canada Customs and Revenue Agency wished to carry out such a verification. The LDC Governments were not required to do anything else than cooperate by allowing Canadian inspectors to visit the LDCs to verify that countries claiming benefits were entitled to them. The Government of Canada intended to enforce that verification strictly as there was scope for false claiming. Any shipment identified as not qualified would immediately be stopped. It was therefore in the interests of all LDC Governments to ensure that their manufacturers were aware of that rule and would cooperate with the Canadian authorities.","WTCOMTDM44.pdf","Canada, LDC, Canada, Canada, Customs, and, Revenue, Agency, Canada, Customs, and, Revenue, Agency, Canada"

The Chairman recalled that, when the issue had been discussed in 2002 at the 43rd Session of the CTD, the Secretariat had provided a clarification regarding the notification obligations for RTAs among developing countries. What the Secretariat had said was that Members had to indicate under which legal cover they notified their RTAs. The WTO body receiving such notifications would then decide where it would go, i.e. whether it should be referred to the CRTA or not. There were two elements to the issues raised by delegations. The first related to the procedure the CTD should follow for RTAs notified under the Enabling Clause. The other element related to specific RTAs that had already been notified. His personal inclination with respect to the second element was that, once an RTA had been taken note of in the CTD, Members should be careful in going back to the matter. With respect to the first element regarding the procedure for dealing with RTAs, he suggested that the CTD seek a legal opinion from the Secretariat and keep the item on the agenda and revert to it at the next meeting.","WTCOMTDM44.pdf","Chairman, CTD, Secretariat, Secretariat, Members, WTO, CRTA, CTD, RTA, CTD, Members, CTD, Secretariat"
"4702",4702,"11","11.      He went on to speak about the manufacture of apparel. If yarns and fabric made in any of the more than 100 countries eligible for Canadian GSP treatment were sent to an LDC and manufactured into an apparel product, the Government of Canada only required that 25 per cent of the value added be produced in the LDC for the product to receive duty and quota-free treatment into Canada. A number of other GSP schemes had 50 per cent value-added requirements for similar imports. The Government of Canada was of the view that a requirement of 50 per cent was too high and might not generate sufficient trade amongst the LDCs. The Government of Canada had, along with its own analysis, used work carried out by UNCTAD when examining the value added in apparel. It had found that the lowest value-added producer identified, which was Senegal, produced a value-added of 27 per cent while some countries produced up to 40 per cent of the value added. The Government of Canada had thus decided to use 25 per cent as a threshold in order to ensure that it was below the lowest value added of any LDC. That would ensure that all LDCs had a genuine opportunity to benefit from the Canadian initiative. What was required was that the product be sewn or assembled in the LDC. The Government of Canada did not wish to have products produced in other developing countries shipped to LDCs for a label to be sewn on and then shipped to Canada, as that did not generate any real economic activity in the LDC. The intention was to generate real economic growth in the LDCs, while at the same time ensure that other developing countries had the opportunity to benefit from the new initiative. The idea of limiting the beneficiaries to developing countries was to encourage South-South trade and the reduction of barriers between developing countries and LDCs. As the LDCs did not produce textiles, the textiles had to come from other developing countries. All developing countries could thus benefit from the new initiative if they were prepared to trade among themselves.","WTCOMTDM44.pdf","GSP, Canada, LDC, Canada, GSP, Canada, Canada, UNCTAD, Senegal, Canada, LDCs, Canada, Canada, LDCs"

He said that his delegation was of the view that the Enabling Clause should not be treated in the same way as Article XXIV of GATT 1994. The difference was clear in that that Article XXIV required the passage of an RTA through some kind of an examination and WT/COMTD/M/44 Page 32 consultations. The Enabling Clause, recognizing the burden and the cost that such an examination might have on developing countries, did not provide for that type of exercise. All it required, as mentioned by the representative of India, was that the developing country parties to an agreement promptly notify it. No examination should be carried out, either in the CTD or in the CRTA. The CTD should only take note of the agreement, as long as it was consistent with the Enabling Clause.","WTCOMTDM44.pdf","Egypt, India, GATT, RTA, India, CTD, CRTA, CTD"
"4700",4700,"108","108.     The representative of the European Communities said that the delegation of the United States had raised what his delegation also considered to be an important issue that merited further consideration in the CTD. His delegation recognized the value of regional integration for developing countries, whether in the form of agreements between developing countries or between developing and developed countries. His delegation had gained much experience from its own practice of concluding agreements with developing countries. His delegation had also come to recognize that regional integration between developing countries was an important component of that process and a complement to the integration of developing countries into the Multilateral Trading System. It was important to consider the design and content of agreements between developing countries to ensure that they contributed to the development of the countries concerned. All members of the CTD had a strong interest in understanding and receiving information about the many RTAs concluded among developing countries. He therefore supported the call for a discussion of initiatives that Members might take to ensure continued and effective transparency in the area. He also acknowledged the technical skills and knowledge that resided in the CRTA. He was aware that the CTD would not be able to take conclusive decisions on the issue immediately. However, the issue merited further attention in the coming months and at the next meeting of the CTD. He said that the implications that a general debate on notification requirements would have on individual, already concluded RTAs was an aspect that needed to be addressed.","WTCOMTDM44.pdf","European, Communities, United, States, CTD, CTD, Members, CRTA, CTD, CTD"
"4699",4699,"107","107.    He continued by saying that the existing rules dealt with the issue of transparency for RTAs among developing countries in a sufficient manner. There was no need to revisit the issue. It had been mentioned that paragraph 4 of the Enabling Clause provided for some sort of review or examination. His delegation's view was that no examination was foreseen by the Enabling Clause. The practice in the CTD had been that RTAs under the Enabling Clause had been notified and Members had had the chance to comment and make observations. The notification had thereafter been taken note of by the Committee. With respect to the questions and answers mentioned by the representative of the United States he said that the Committee was not currently discussing any particular RTA. It was discussing transparency and notification procedures in general. He would not make any specific response with respect to the RTA between India and Sri Lanka as doing so would raise a more substantive issue in terms of the practice followed in the CTD for RTAs notified under the Enabling Clause. He said that, regarding the suggestion to also notify such agreements to the CRTA, his delegation maintained the view that the existing rules were sufficiently clear and addressed the question of transparency recognized in paragraph 4 of the Enabling Clause. Any additional onerous burden on developing countries, either in relation to notifications of RTAs to the CRTA or any review or examination was not warranted, particularly in view of the relatively small share of world trade covered by those RTAs.","WTCOMTDM44.pdf","CTD, Members, Committee, United, States, Committee, RTA, RTA, India, Sri, Lanka, CTD, CRTA, CRTA"
"4698",4698,"106","106.    The representative of India said that the agenda item under discussion related to notification procedures for RTAs among developing countries and not to any particular RTA notified earlier under the Enabling Clause. At the 43rd Session of the CTD, when the representative of the United States had requested the inclusion of the agenda item, it had been clarified that the intention was to discuss the transparency aspect of RTAs notified under the Enabling Clause, not to discuss any specific RTA. The representative of the United States had raised a number of substantive points. However, since reference had been made to the RTA notified jointly by the Governments of India and Sri Lanka he said that he would reiterate his delegation's position. The India-Sri Lanka RTA had been notified to the CTD in June 2002 under the Enabling Clause. The notification had been put on the agenda of the                                                                                    WT/COMTD/M/44                                                                                           Page 31 CTD for its meeting in July 2002. At the request of some members, it had been kept on the agenda for the October 2002 meeting of the Committee. Members had therefore had ample opportunity to comment and share their observations on that notification. The Committee had thereafter proceeded to take note of the notification at its meeting in October 2002. In fact, the Secretariat had also been asked to provide a clarification regarding the notification procedures for RTAs notified under the Enabling Clause. The Enabling Clause provided for regional or global arrangements among developing countries for the mutual reduction or elimination of tariffs and all non-tariff measures. Such RTAs were notified to the CTD. His delegation did recognize the transparency obligations in paragraph 4(a) of the Enabling Clause. Keeping those transparency obligations in mind, the Governments of India and Sri Lanka had jointly notified their RTA to the CTD. His delegation believed that it had complied with the transparency obligations alluded to by the representative of the United States and fulfilled its obligations according to the practice in the CTD.","WTCOMTDM44.pdf","India, RTA, CTD, United, States, RTA, United, States, RTA, India, Sri, Lanka, India-Sri, Lanka, RTA, CTD, CTD, Committee, Members, Committee, Secretariat, CTD, India, Sri, Lanka, RTA, CTD, United, States, CTD"

"4696",4696,"104","104.      The representative of the United States said that her delegation was of the view that there was no time-limit for asking questions about specific RTAs, nor had her delegation forgone its right to raise it in the context of other committees' activities. She had simply used the example of a recently notified agreement. Her delegation was pleased that that RTA had been notified and was grateful to the parties to that agreement for having done so. However, that the CTD had taken note of the notification was not necessarily the end of the process. Her delegation was not trying to begin a process that was particularly burdensome. The questions her delegation would pose were not overwhelming in number or scope. Nevertheless, the India-Sri Lanka RTA could serve as an example for the Committee to consider a logical way of dealing with notifications of RTAs among developing countries in the future. Such agreements were proliferating. It was therefore an important point of principle to ensure that there was an opportunity for other members to raise questions when such agreements were notified. The Governments of India and Sri Lanka had chosen to notify their RTA to the CTD. That was why her delegation had raised the question in the CTD. There was another appropriate WTO body which had oversight over RTAs. However, she understood that there were differences of view on the appropriate forum. Her delegation did not only wish to discuss a particular agreement but also consider how notifications of RTAs among developing countries would be dealt with in the future. She said that her delegation welcomed any ideas about what an adequate approach for review would be in the CTD. The fact, that an agreement was notified under the Enabling Clause did not mean that other WTO Members did not have the right to raise questions and have them answered. Her delegation would welcome the participation of the CTD in the process.","WTCOMTDM44.pdf","United, States, RTA, CTD, India-Sri, Lanka, RTA, Committee, India, Sri, Lanka, RTA, CTD, CTD, WTO, CTD, WTO, Members, CTD"

The Chairman said that it created a slight problem for the Committee that the delegation of the United States raised one particular RTA as that agreement had already been notified and discussed in the CTD.

"4694",4694,"102","102.    She went on to say that, at the 43rd Session of the CTD in November 2002, her delegation had requested the Committee to include an item on the agenda relating to notification procedures for RTAs among developing countries. The aim of that request was to consider positive steps the CTD could take to improve the review process for the purposes of greater transparency in RTAs. Paragraph 4 of the Enabling Clause specified that an opportunity for review and discussion had to be provided if interested WTO Members so requested. Her delegation was interested in a discussion and review of all such agreements. To begin the process, her delegation was finalizing a set of questions concerning the India-Sri Lanka RTA and looked forward to receiving responses to them. She hoped to provide both delegations with the questions within the next couple of days. The questions her delegation had developed requested some additional information of interest to all traders. Her delegation sought a better understanding of the basic nature and scope of the RTA and how it had WT/COMTD/M/44 Page 30 operated since its entry into force. As a practical matter, and in keeping with the various mandates of the respective WTO committees and councils, she said that it would be appropriate to consider questions and answers and any other follow-up in the Committee on Regional Trade Agreements (CRTA) rather than in the CTD, as highly technical questions were involved. The CRTA would therefore be a more appropriate forum given the expertise it had developed over time. A review in the CRTA did not in itself prejudge whether an agreement was subject to the Enabling Clause, Article XXIV of the GATT or Article V of the GATS. She noted that the CRTA had been notified of agreements under the Enabling Clause in the past as well as agreements under the GATT and the GATS and that the CRTA was in the process of reviewing a great number of such agreements. Her delegation wished to begin the process by raising questions and get an opportunity to consult, preferably in the CRTA. However, the CTD could also be involved if Members found that helpful as it had a mandate in that area. Her delegation was prepared to have a joint exercise of the CRTA and the CTD if there was such a desire. What her delegation considered necessary was a public discussion in order for all Members to be kept informed.","WTCOMTDM44.pdf","CTD, Committee, CTD, WTO, Members, India-Sri, Lanka, RTA, RTA, WTO, Committee, CRTA, CTD, CRTA, CRTA, GATT, CRTA, GATT, GATS, CRTA, CRTA, CTD, Members, CRTA, CTD, Members"

The representative of the United States began by stating her delegation's support for the efforts made by developing countries to enhance regional trade integration through RTAs, such as the India-Sri Lanka RTA notified to the CTD. Her delegation noted the rising interest among developing countries in RTAs and regional liberalization. That was a positive development which her delegation encouraged, and which her delegation believed that other WTO Members should encourage. Her Government was also pursuing bilateral and regional trade integration as well as multilateral efforts to promote more open trade among nations. She said that her delegation was pleased that other Members saw the value of more open markets with their neighbours. At the same, time her delegation had always believed that those agreements had to be consistent with WTO rules and that there should be a forum to allow Members to better understand them. Transparency in the trading system was a fundamental obligation and right in the WTO.","WTCOMTDM44.pdf","United, States, India-Sri, Lanka, RTA, CTD, WTO, Members, Members, WTO, Members, WTO"

"4691",4691,"10","10.       He continued by saying that the existing rules of origin, applicable to the 90 per cent of the tariff lines which already entered duty and quota-free, had been extended to the products under the new initiative for LDCs with one exception. That exception related to textiles and apparel. The rules of origin originally established did not deal with textiles and apparel. Some textile products had already been granted duty-free access under the previous regime. However, the rules of origin did not take account of the current structure of world trade in textiles and apparel. The Government of Canada had therefore established new liberal rules of origin to cover textiles and apparel. There were two ways that an apparel product could qualify for the Canadian GSP scheme for LDCs. First, if the WT/COMTD/M/44 Page 4 product was entirely produced amongst any LDC and Canada. However, few products were currently produced that way because most LDCs did not have the capacity and the investment necessary to produce the fabric required for apparel. In order to ensure that the new initiative for LDCs was a genuine trade initiative, the Government of Canada had thus introduced a second means by which a product could qualify for the GSP scheme for LDCs. The new initiative permitted that accumulation of up to 75 per cent of the value of a product might originate in any country eligible for Canada's preferential tariff under the GSP scheme. More than 100 countries were eligible for Canada's preferential tariff under the GSP scheme. The intention was to make the new initiative a genuine development assistance program and keep entirely to the spirit of the Enabling Clause. That meant, with respect to textiles, that if the yarns had been made in any of those 100 countries or Canada, those yarns could be sent to any LDC and be turned into fabric. That fabric could then be sold to Canada and be considered as originating in the LDC and therefore receive duty and quota-free treatment.","WTCOMTDM44.pdf","LDCs, Canada, GSP, LDCs, Canada, LDCs, Canada, GSP, Canada, GSP, Canada, GSP, Canada, Canada, LDC"

However, in light of the recent developments in the TNC, it was his WT/COMTD/M/44 Page 2 understanding that there was no need for the CTD to consider the matter further at that stage. He therefore proposed that item F be deleted from the agenda and that he would brief the incoming Chairperson of the CTD of the work carried out in the Committee and advise him to consult with the TNC Chairperson regarding further steps, if any, the CTD should take with respect to Article XVIII as an outstanding implementation issue.","WTCOMTDM44.pdf","Chairman, GATT, Committee, on, Trade, and, Development, CTD, Trade, Negotiations, Committee, TNC, TNC, CTD, Chairperson, CTD, Committee, TNC, Chairperson, CTD"

The Chairman said that Members had expressed their views on the draft 2003 TA Plan and he believed that activities requested by members in general should be included in the 2003 TA Plan, not as outreach activities but possibly as capacity building activities. He sought Members' guidance with respect to the trade and environment symposium for NGOs as he was not certain that there was a common understanding among Members about how to deal with it. He said that, after the clarification that had been provided, Members might be able to accept the regional workshops that would be held in cooperation with the Commonwealth Secretariat, the International Development Bank (IDB), and the Institute for the Integration of Latin America and the Caribbean (INTAL). With respect to the procedure for accepting requests from individual Members, he said that the representative of China had made the point that the requests should go through the national channel dealing with WTO issues, which was the channel that Members used for paying the WTO.","WTCOMTDM43.pdf","Chairman, Members, Members, Members, Members, Commonwealth, Secretariat, International, Development, Bank, IDB, Institute, for, the, Integration, of, Latin, America, Caribbean, Members, China, WTO, Members, WTO"

"4677",4677,"93","93.      The representative of the European Communities said that there had been extensive informal consultations on whether and how to organise symposia in the past. The last was consultation in 1999 had ended in a general agreement that the Secretariat should go ahead and organise such symposia on the implicit understanding that they be organised on a regular basis. He said that Members could again have a fundamental debate on those issues. However, it would probably lead to the same conclusion that the Secretariat had a certain flexibility to organise such activities and that Members should trust the Secretariat to organise them in a way which would make sense. That included having a list of invitees which were in line with the mandate of the Secretariat. That meant to invite participants who possessed the relevant expertise and who were relevant for the discussions. He did believe that there was a danger of getting participants from human rights groups or other non trade- related NGOs. That had not happened in the past as far as he knew. With respect to the funding of the symposia, he said that their funding had been taken out of the regular budget in 2001 and that Members, as a compromise, had decided that it be financed from the Trust Fund as a capacity building activities. One reason was that most of the money was used to finance the participation of representatives from developing country NGOs to attend the symposia. That was also the purpose of having a separate budget line for such activities. It was a way of helping those who would not otherwise be able to attend a symposia in Geneva. He felt that it therefore was logical to keep those activities under capacity building. In that context Members needed to consider what capacity building was and it would be difficult to argue that the trade and environment symposium was not a capacity building activity. In addition, Members had agreed that it was important to synergise and make best use of the budget by holding more regional activities and less national activities. If the symposium was removed as a regional activity from the 2003 TA Plan some Members would probably request such a symposium as a national activity and Members would find themselves where they currently were. He agreed with the representative of Lesotho that it was difficult to refuse well founded national activities. That led him to pledged that members with doubts overcome them and not begin to consider each individual of the over four hundred activities, in order to allow for a smooth passage of the 2003 TA Plan in a time frame that would enable the Secretariat to start organising the activities in a timely manner.

With respect to discussions held pre-Doha and post-Doha, there was an understanding that there was a rational for improving communications, transparency and relations, not just with civil society, but with the international public.","WTCOMTDM43.pdf","Osakwe, Director, Technical, Cooperation, Division, NGO"

"4664",4664,"81","81.      Deputy Director-General Dr. Rana said that, although Members were currently considering the 2003 TA Plan, the Secretariat worked towards long term institutional capacity building. The regional trade policy courses held in Africa was one way in which the Secretariat aimed to build institutional capacity by working with local universities. The Training Institute had similar programmes and the three-week training-of-trainers courses enhanced the training capacity of those who would lecture at the regional courses. The Secretariat would not depend exclusively on its own human resources. Part of the technical assistance delivery could be outsourced. The Secretariat had already opened a roster for which it was identifying university professors as well as retired WTO Ambassadors and retired Secretariat staff who could supplement the scarce resources of the Secretariat. He assured Members that the Secretariat would consult more and would begin early to plan the 2004 TA Plan. It was important for the Secretariat to consult Members on all aspects of technical assistance and capacity building and not only with respect to the yearly TA plans. For example, it was important to discuss the regional trade policy courses as they were meant to fulfil the DDA plan of developing trade negotiation skills in developing countries and as the they were geared towards institutional capacity building. In that context he thanked the representative of Canada for mentioning that her Government was prepared to sponsor a regional trade policy course for Caribbean countries. The implementation of the 2003 TA Plan would be dynamic and the issues of coherence would be taken on board.","WTCOMTDM43.pdf","Director-General, Rana, Members, Secretariat, Africa, Secretariat, Training, Institute, Secretariat, Secretariat, WTO, Secretariat, Secretariat, Members, Secretariat, Secretariat, Members, DDA, Canada, Caribbean"
"4663",4663,"80","80.      The representative of the European Communities said that Members generally agreed that they wished to arrive at the best possible TA plan, given the budget available. They also seemed to agree that the question of accountability had to be addressed. His delegation supported the point made by the representative of Norway with respect to the outreach programmes. He said that Members had attempted to include some of those activities in the normal budget. Some developing country members had then said that they did not wish to pay for those activities. It was suggested that those activities be part of the Trust Fund which had an important element to ensure that capacity was being built for integration of trade in national policies. Such programmes would not work unless parliaments and civil societies supported them. The outreach activities were an important element of TA and his delegation hoped to see them included in the draft 2003 TA Plan. There were only 12 outreach activities and his delegation did not feel that it was an issue that Members should spend too much time arguing about. His delegation was in a position to enable the Secretariat to go ahead and implement the 2003 TA Plan as long as there was a clear commitment from the Secretariat to follow up on the issues that Members had raised. He asked whether the Secretariat would be willing to commit to being guided by what Members had said indicate when it would provide some of the information Members had requested. In particular, he asked whether the Secretariat would provide the standard accounting, as recommended by the representative of Canada, by the time of the evaluation and provide account auditing by March 2003. The Secretariat needed to commit itself to prepare quarterly reports on replacement activities and activities carried out as well as commit itself to provide a full evaluation in March 2003 that would be discussed in the CTD with the aim of reviewing the then ongoing 2003 TA Plan and adapt it accordingly as was foreseen in the terms of reference. The Secretariat needed to also commit itself to consider more closely the terms of reference and all documentation which governed the access to the TA funds and replacement activities. That would include, among other things, a consideration of a possible continuation of the more interesting programmes such as the regional trade policy courses held in Africa. In addition, the Secretariat needed to commit itself to present a plan on increased outsourcing by March 2003, or earlier. It was important for delegations to be assured that nothing had been decided on the trade clinics, because they might be a way of falling back into the trap of ad hoc activities. There had to be clear terms of reference and a for any trade clinic. Any agreement on the draft 2003 TA Plan would not mean an unconditional acceptance of the trade clinics.

"4661",4661,"79","79.      The representative of Uganda said that his delegation agreed that TA/CB could play a critical role in helping developing countries, in particular the LDCs, to integrate into the multilateral trading system. He said that any assistance to enable developing countries to understand their rights and implement obligations, or to train their trade negotiators meant very little, if those countries did not have anything to trade, or if what they had to trade, was already covered under existing trade preference schemes. That was why his delegation believed that, when TA activities were elaborated, the emphasis had to be placed on section XIII of document WT/COMTD/W/104.Rev.1 which related to strategic partnerships between the WTO Secretariat and other international agencies, regional development banks and the Development Assistance Committee of the Organisation for Economic Co-Operation and Development (OECD-DAC). In that regard, he suggested that the Secretariat brief Members on the outcome of such initiatives already undertaken. He said that TA/CB were only part of the single undertaking agreed upon by Ministers at the Doha Ministerial Conference. Therefore TA/CB was just one of the aspects of integrating developing countries particularly LDCs, into the multilateral trading system. Other ways included helping those countries to address their supply side constraints. The best TA/CB that the WTO could offer to those countries was to take on board their concerns, especially in the areas of S&D and in relation to implementation related problems and concerns.","WTCOMTDM43.pdf","Uganda, WTO, Secretariat, Development, Assistance, Committee, of, the, Organisation, for, Economic, Co-Operation, and, Development, Secretariat, Members, Doha, Ministerial, Conference, WTO"
"4660",4660,"78","78.     The representative of Kenya said that the only way that institutional capacity could be built in developing countries, especially in Africa, was through regional courses such as the ones that had been held in Nairobi and Casablanca. He said that the Nairobi courses had been successful and some of those who had attended those courses were participating in the current negotiations on agriculture. If the regional trade policy courses would be included in the 2003 TA Plan as promised by the Secretariat, he said that Members needed to know when those courses would be held so that preparations could begin given that the Training Institute had previously not had sufficient time to prepare them. His delegation was surprised at the suggestion made by the representative of the United States on the creation of a trade and advisory body. He assumed that the idea was to consider all trade WT/COMTD/M/43 Page 30 policy courses and not just the regional courses held in Nairobi and Casablanca. Those regional courses had already undergone a sufficient evaluation and did not require another body to evaluate them.","WTCOMTDM43.pdf","Kenya, Africa, Nairobi, Casablanca, Nairobi, Secretariat, Members, Training, Institute, United, States, Nairobi, Casablanca"

However, his delegation was still not convinced that the Secretariat possessed sufficient human resources to carry out such an extensive Plan. Nevertheless, his delegation was in favour of the thrust of the revised 2003 TA Plan. His delegation believed that the creation of an advisory organ, as suggested by the representative of the United States, could be useful but Members needed to be careful not to fall into the pitfall of micro- management. He was puzzled by the concerns expressed, particularly by the representative of India, with respect to the outreach activities because it was difficult to understand how national consensus could be built for the advantages of WTO membership if parliamentarians and civil society were not well informed. Evaluation of the effectiveness and cost efficiency of WTO TA was important to enhance the effectiveness of future projects and his delegation looked forward to receiving such information in the future.

"4655",4655,"73","73.     The representative of Mexico said that in principle his delegation could accept the 2003 TA Plan, but had two comments to make. First, he said that the 2003 TA Plan did not contain certain aspects and it was important that those be included in future TA plans. His delegation had submitted a proposal in the Committee on Technical Barriers to Trade (G/TBT/W/189) on the creation of                                                                                      WT/COMTD/M/43                                                                                             Page 29 institutional capacity building in developing countries. His delegation noted with concern that there was still a focus on traditional TA activities which had the disadvantage of privileging the manpower in many government offices who would, after receiving the training, go to work in the private sector. That meant starting over with the training of new officials. That was a critical point that needed to be taken into account. Second, it was important to evaluate TA activities, not just in terms of whether the planned activities had been completed, but more importantly form the perspective of whether the activities carried out had been of use to the beneficiary country and with a view to making them more effective over time. Members would need guidelines and manuals relating to the quality of TA so that once an activity had been delivered, it could be evaluated at any given time.","WTCOMTDM43.pdf","Mexico, Committee, on, Technical, Barriers, to, Trade, Members"

The representative of Argentina said that his delegation was generally satisfied with the 2003 TA Plan and particularly with the methodology followed to develop it based on consultations and dialogue with Members. He was also satisfied with the principles and criteria which shaped the draft 2003 TA Plan prepared by the Secretariat. His delegation appreciated the priority given to LDCs, which it found important and the fact that the draft 2003 TA Plan included activities for countries in accession. However, his delegation also shared the concern expressed by the delegation of India and other Members, about the relevance of including outreach activities in the 2003 TA Plan. His delegation agreed that those activities were important, but wondered whether it was appropriate to include them as a chapter of the 2003 TA Plan, or whether they could be considered in other areas of the WTO. The trade policy courses in Nairobi and Casablanca, constituted a good experience and were worthwhile continuing. In that respect he shared what the delegation of Paraguay had indicated on behalf of the GRULAC the previous week, and what the representative of Venezuela had just recalled, that the possibility of holding such courses in other developing country regions including the GRULAC, should be explored.","WTCOMTDM43.pdf","Argentina, Members, Secretariat, India, Members, WTO, Nairobi, Casablanca, Paraguay, Venezuela"
"4653",4653,"71","71.     The representative of Malaysia said that, as the 2003 TA Plan had been prepared much earlier than the 2002 TA Plan implementation could proceed in the beginning of 2003. Considering the large number of activities planned for 2003, her delegation was concerned that the quality of the activities could be affected by competing demands in the run up to the Fifth Ministerial Conference. Efforts needed to be maximised as early as possible so that Members would not experience any slippage in the implementation of the 2003 TA Plan at the end of 2003. She noted that the highest number of planned activities was in the area of capacity building. Although that seemed rather impressive, she noted that many of those activities were technical missions for trade policy reviews as well as national trade policy courses. Her delegation looked forward to see the inclusion of more technical capacity building programmes to build capacity in the area of negotiations, trade policy development, and the training-of-trainers in cooperation with other agencies if relevant. She said that there was a need to continuously upgrade the quality of TA activities and her delegation hoped that the Secretariat, Member Governments and partner agencies would work together to design programmes that would better meet members' needs. In that respect her delegation hoped that national skills could be improved through a series of well planned TA programmes designed to progressively take Members through a whole range of subject matters and result in broad and more comprehensive capacity building and training programmes. She agreed that Members would benefit from an evaluation of previous TA activities, not only in terms of financial accountability but also in terms of the performance levels, the difficulties encountered, onsite evaluations and feedback from beneficiaries. That would help to improve future TA plans. She concluded by saying that her delegation shared the concerns raised by some delegations in relation to the inclusion of the outreach activities in the 2003 TA Plan as it was not clear how those activities related to TA.","WTCOMTDM43.pdf","Malaysia, Members, Secretariat, Member, Members, Members"

The representative of the Republic of Korea said that he was pleased to note that there had been a reduction in the cost of the 2003 TA Plan through cost sharing with other development agencies and an effort to streamline programmes. Nevertheless, his delegation shared the concerns expressed by other delegations regarding the funding of the 2003 TA Plan. In that regard he suggested that the Secretariat consider more cost effective ways of delivering TA, including greater collaboration with other development agencies, outsourcing some programmes and the use of information technologies for online education for example. His delegation believed that a certain degree of flexibility with respect to the ad hoc activities should be permitted in order to respond to WT/COMTD/M/43 Page 28 members' needs based on the process of the DDA negotiations and initiatives from donor countries. His delegation believed that seminars and workshops that had been carried out for specific negotiation skills in 2002 had been appreciated because they had been helpful in facilitating the discussions in the negotiation groups. Some flexibility for hosting such activities should therefore be incorporated in the 2003 TA Plan. At the same time, flexibility was required to facilitate that initiatives in donor countries' own TA plans be carried out in cooperation with the WTO Secretariat so as to contribute to the DDA negotiations. His delegation was concerned with the pressure on the Secretariat to both assist DDA negotiations and carry out WTO TA activities. Considering the number of activities in the 2003 TA Plan, Members needed to think of possible ways to reduce the Secretariat's load to a manageable level. Outsourcing was one way to address that concern, but Members needed to consider other options which his delegation believed existed.","WTCOMTDM43.pdf","Republic, of, Korea, Secretariat, DDA, WTO, Secretariat, DDA, Secretariat, DDA, WTO, Members, Secretariat, Members"

Those member countries were not represented in Geneva and could therefore not make that request themselves. She said that Members might have been aware that her Government currently earmarked its Global Trust Fund contributions for those countries in order to ensure that they would not be overlooked in the 2003 TA Plan. Her delegation appreciated that the practice of earmarking was unfashionable and her Government was therefore trying to review that practice. Any assurance that the special challenges of the countries in the Pacific Islands were being incorporated into the 2003 TA Plan would therefore be helpful to the review of her Government's tagging practice.","WTCOMTDM43.pdf","New, Zealand, Australia, Pacific, Islands, Geneva, Members, Global, Trust, Fund, Pacific, Islands"

The representative of China said that the TA activities carried out in 2002 played an important role in helping the developing countries better understand the issues relating to the implementation of the existing WTO Agreements and the DDA and enhance their participation in the multilateral trading system, particularly in the new negotiations. Members had experienced the first year of the negotiations within the framework of the DDA and there were at least another two years to go if Members were optimistic enough to believe that the negotiations could be concluded within the time frame fixed by Ministers at the Doha Ministerial Conference. A lot of work remained to be done by the Members, and the Secretariat in the area of capacity building and technical cooperation. His delegation endorsed the draft 2003 TA Plan and had taken note of its new characteristic. His delegation believed that capacity building and technical cooperation should be member and needs driven and specifically designed to meet different members' needs. In that regard he agreed with the representative of Canada that sufficient flexibility needed to be given to the Secretariat with respect to responding to ad hoc requests from members, as long as those requests were within the financial and human resource constraints of the Secretariat.","WTCOMTDM43.pdf","China, WTO, DDA, Members, DDA, Members, Doha, Ministerial, Conference, Members, Secretariat, Canada, Secretariat, Secretariat"

The meeting held on 4 November 2002 had been attended by a group of developing and least-developed countries. A number of points had emerged from those discussions. First, it was important to ensure that TA/CB activities scheduled in the 2003 TA Plan were directed at increasing institutional capacity in developing countries. Second transparency in the preparation of the TA plans was essential. The Secretariat would therefore need to                                                                                      WT/COMTD/M/43                                                                                             Page 27 work in close cooperation with the beneficiary countries, who were to a large extent aware of their own training requirements. Third TA was a multidisciplinary process, and TA activities should therefore take account of the specificities of each country or region. It was important to take the disparities in countries' economies and levels of development into account. TA activities needed to be dynamic and flexible so as to adjust to the needs and expectations of the beneficiary countries. Fourth, it was important to achieve better coherence and coordination with other TA providers. That would ensure ever-increasing efficiency and effectiveness and enable the use of the specific know- how of other international agencies. Fifth, the development of a TA activities menu should be further explored. Such a menu should offer the beneficiary countries a broad range of options encompassing different types of programmes in a variety of areas and sectors, adapted to different levels of knowledge and which could be adjusted to the needs of each recipient. Sixth, it was important to improve the process of evaluation and follow-up of the TA activities delivered by the Secretariat in developing countries. She said that her delegation believed that it would be interesting to have a few pre-defined criteria that would enhance the efficiency of such evaluations. Seventh, she said that it would be interesting for the beneficiary countries to maintain an ongoing dialogue with the donors and the Secretariat on the evaluation of TA, so as to achieve an overall improvement in WTO TA and be able to implement the commitments in the Doha Ministerial Declaration.","WTCOMTDM43.pdf","Secretariat, Secretariat, Secretariat, WTO"
"4647",4647,"66","66.      The representative of Colombia said that she would pose some questions relating to document WT/COMTD/W/104/Rev.1 in order to get a better understanding of the draft 2003 TA Plan. Section VI on ""Systematic, Cumulative and Sustainable Capacity Building: new products"", contained regional training-of-trainers workshops, the implementation of which would take place through the reference centres. The creation of those workshops was positive because they seemed to be geared towards building capacity over the medium and long term while at the same time expand the institutional capacity that was so important to countries such as Colombia. In that connection, she asked how the courses would be implemented and how they differed from the training-for-trainers programmes being developed by the Training Institute. Her delegation believed that it was important to ensure high quality delivery of those activities and consider the experiences and knowledge available in other divisions of the Secretariat in order to avoid a duplication of efforts. She asked whether that activity would be developed in countries that did not have reference centres but which regarded it as an important activity. A series of activities relating to trade policy reviews were also included in section VI of the Secretariat document. Her delegation understood that to be part of the dynamics of the Trade Policy Review Body. She asked whether that was an additional activity to the three activities assigned to each country, or whether they formed part of the TA activities under the DDA.","WTCOMTDM43.pdf","Colombia, Colombia, Training, Institute, Secretariat, Secretariat, DDA"
"4646",4646,"65","65.      The representative of Switzerland said that his delegation could agree with the draft 2003 TA Plan with the condition that there be future improvements and consolidation of the TA plan. He said that he would make two points, the first related to the instruments of the 2003 TA Plan and the second related to the scope of the 2003 TA Plan. First, in relation to the instruments of the 2003 TA Plan he WT/COMTD/M/43 Page 26 said that the planning of the programme of WTO TA should rely on past experience and evaluation of previous activities. That was not yet the case and that was why the technical cooperation audit was so important. His delegation believed that the Technical Cooperation Audit Unit should be strengthened. The draft 2003 TA Plan included a number of untested instruments such as the regional seminars for WTO reference centres. He asked how the Secretariat saw the future of those centres in relation to the regional seminars and the build up of partner institutions under those regional seminars. Many delegations had mentioned trade clinics and he noted many possible synergies between the trade clinics and the goal of monitoring S&D. Trade clinics could be a means for direct contact with member countries on the difficulties they experienced with TA and in implementing trade rules. That needed to be explored as that was what the monitoring system was meant for. With respect to a future activity mix he said that distance learning was something the Secretariat needed to explore. The workshops and seminars, which currently were the most important instruments, were untested instruments. However, his delegation doubted whether they should be the main instruments. There was no clear evaluation showing what instruments to use in the future. There needed to be a well justified mix of complimentary instruments. There was also a need for specific goals and benchmarks and an evaluated programme which Members could base the next stage on. Second, in relation to the scope of the 2003 TA Plan, he said that there was a clear problem of capacity. The draft 2003 TA Plan (WT/COMTD/W/104/Add.1/Rev.1) contained 443 activities. However, the number would depend on the modes and instruments of delivery of the programme. It was difficult to justify the resource implications of such a threshold. His delegation believed that that was a maximum. Contrary to what the representative of Tanzania had said, his delegation did not believe that the Secretariat should go back to a bigger programme. That was not because his delegation did not understand the need. However, over time the Secretariat needed to undertake more training for trainers programmes and outsource more. In three to four years time there should be a WTO TA programme with four components. The first should be coordination, and the Secretariat had already showed that it had those links; the second should be quality control of TA programmes in the trade field; the third might involve having part of the financing for outsourced programmes going through the WTO; and fourth a small core WTO TA programme, much smaller than the present programme, related to the operations of the WTO.","WTCOMTDM43.pdf","Switzerland, WTO, WTO, Secretariat, S&D, Secretariat, Members, Tanzania, Secretariat, Secretariat, WTO, Secretariat, WTO, WTO, WTO"
"4645",4645,"64","64.      She went on to say that it was good that the revised draft 203 TA Plan had been rationalised. Her delegation realised the importance of limiting the delivery of TA to a manageable set of activities within the Secretariat's area of expertise. At the same time, the WTO had to act as a coordinator for activities that were best executed by other agencies with appropriate experience. She said that if beneficiaries and other members could agree in principle to the draft 2003 TA Plan, then her delegation was prepared to do the same but with a number of conditions, some of which had been stated by other members. The representative of Kenya had at the previous meeting of the CTD, suggested that requests in future plans should be costed so that Members could determine the opportunity costs and benefits of what was being suggested before they made any decisions. Her delegation requested that Members receive a clear accounting of how much of the Global Trust Fund would be available for roll-over into 2003, including Window 2 funds, and how the Secretariat proposed to use those funds. Though it was impossible at that time, she requested that the Secretariat develop guidelines for the use of Global Trust Fund funds in the future. In considering future funding commitments, donors needed to be reassured that the Secretariat had a solid and defendable framework in place for prioritising the large number of TA/CB requests it received from developing countries. Such guidelines were also needed for transparency and sound fiscal management. As far as reporting was concerned, she agreed with the representative of India that there needed to be a report that included information on where new ad hoc activities replaced planned activities, what activities they replaced, what activities had been cancelled, the reasons for that and what activities had been completed. That could be provided on a quarterly basis as the representative of the United States had suggested. Members needed to know how the 2003 TA Plan was implemented as the year progressed. She recommended another revision of the draft 2003 TA Plan which would align it more with the structure of the database because Members needed to know that what they were doing in the WTO was manageable within the context of the database. With respect to the regional trade policy course held in Nairobi and Casablanca, she said that her Government was willing to consider providing some funding for a similar course in the Caribbean. However, before confirming that funding her delegation needed to get assurances that it would be possible to carry out such a course given the limited resources in the Secretariat. Her delegation supported the idea of the representative of the Unites States of having an advisory body to monitor the TA plan.","WTCOMTDM43.pdf","Secretariat, WTO, Kenya, CTD, Members, Members, Secretariat, Secretariat, Global, Trust, Fund, Secretariat, India, United, States, Members, Members, WTO, Nairobi, Casablanca, Caribbean, Secretariat, Unites, States"
"4644",4644,"63","63.      The representative of Canada said that the information that the Secretariat had provided was critical for ensuring accountability. To ensure full accountability Members needed to receive complete information regarding the 2002 TA Plan, including information on the number of person- days, including travel days and out of office days, involved in delivering the Plan. Her delegation had requested that information and understood that it would be provided to Members when available. Full                                                                                       WT/COMTD/M/43                                                                                              Page 25 and complete accounting of that nature was consistent with standard accounting procedures. She also asked the Secretariat to provide further details on its standard costs as they were refined. With respect to the ad hoc activities she said that her delegation appreciated the Secretariat's transparency and requested that at the end of the year, the Secretariat provide Members with a full and costed account of all ad hoc activities that had taken place in 2002. she further requested the Secretariat to include, in the evaluation of the 2002 TA Plan, a section on the ad hoc activities since they constituted such a large proportion of the activities that had been delivered in 2002. While it was important to plan as much as possible in advance, some flexibility had to be built into the 2003 TA Plan. Her delegation recognised that the Secretariat had built in a 5 per cent flexibility for ad hoc activities and wondered whether that was sufficient. There was a large gap between the aim of 5 per cent for 2003 and the 29 per cent ad hoc activities carried out in 2002. While there would always be a need for flexibility her delegation suggested that the Secretariat consider whether 5 per cent was sufficient. Her delegation was pleased to see that the Secretariat had included guidelines governing ad hoc activities in the 2003 TA Plan and hoped that those guidelines would assist in the decision making process. She said that the representative of Japan had requested more details on the trade clinics. Her delegation understood there to be a close relationship between the managing of the ad hoc activities and the trade clinics. She requested that the Secretariat considered guidelines for the trade clinics as well.","WTCOMTDM43.pdf","Canada, Secretariat, Members, Members, Secretariat, Secretariat, Secretariat, Members, Secretariat, Secretariat, Secretariat, Secretariat, Japan, Secretariat"
"4643",4643,"62","62.      He went on to say that his delegation had observed that WTO technical cooperation focused on promoting courses that explained the WTO Agreements. Given the negotiating process that Members were facing, his delegation considered that as a good opportunity to rethink the nature of technical cooperation and take a step towards developing more direct forms of cooperation, including institutional capacity building, for example by preparing specialized manuals, establishing infrastructure, promoting a better understanding of negotiating processes, and enhancing skills to draft proposals. Member the GRULAC region needed to gain a clearer understanding of the effect and impact of agreements in the different areas of negotiations. That was where efforts needed to be focused. That was the time to consider close relationships with other organizations such as UNCTAD and how WTO resources could promote capacity building programmes in UNCTAD. He understood that many other organisations had experience in capacity building but that they in many cases they lacked the resources to develop large-scale programmes. His delegation understood that the Secretariat was under-staffed and could not devote itself exclusively to delivering TA. The Secretariat was at a stage where courses such as those that explained the Agreements, could be delivered electronically as a form of distance learning. The focus could then be on technical cooperation for infrastructure and technology. His delegation was concerned that the activities for his country's region had not been divided into different groups as had previously been the case. That could result in language problems.","WTCOMTDM43.pdf","WTO, WTO, Members, Member, UNCTAD, WTO, UNCTAD, Secretariat, Secretariat"
"4642",4642,"61","61.      The representative of Venezuela said that his delegation hoped that the 2003 TA Plan would be successfully implemented and that budget cuts would be offset by the effective delivery of the scheduled activities, which he believed could meet Members needs and expectations. His delegation agreed with the comments made by the representative of Paraguay at the last meeting of the CTD on behalf of the GRULAC, especially with respect to the need to extend trade policy courses to other regions. An activity designed for a regional group of participants could be more focused on regional issues than the courses held in Geneva where training was given to a fairly heterogeneous group of participants. He believed the regional trade policy courses could respond to the specific needs particular to his region. He agreed with the suggestions made by the representatives of Barbados and the United States, that it would be ideal to take advantage of a region's academic and institutional potential and to work jointly with those institutions in the preparation and implementation of regional activities. That would help tailor the activities and make them more responsive to specific scenari and perhaps even lead to a reduction in costs for the Secretariat without jeopardizing the quality or professional level of the activities. His delegation believed that TA and training needed to go beyond the provision of information on complying with obligations to commitments and understanding implementation issues. Instead, the focus needed to be on capacity building for national institutions to implement productive development policies that were in line with WTO obligations. At the previous meeting of the CTD, his delegation had indicated that a process of consultations had taken place to reflect Members' priorities. He noted that the Secretariat had collaborated with regional donors in order to optimize the use of resources for TA. It was important to pursue the efforts made in identifying focus areas for such activities in order to enhance TA delivered by the WTO and to translate that into effective capacity building.","WTCOMTDM43.pdf","Venezuela, Members, Paraguay, CTD, Geneva, Barbados, United, States, Secretariat, WTO, CTD, Members, Secretariat, WTO"
"4641",4641,"60","60.      She went on to say that the Secretariat's evaluation of the regional trade policy courses held in Nairobi and Casablanca suggested that it was worthwhile to continue those programmes but that they could benefit from greater guidance. Her delegation continued to be concerned about the impact of those courses on the use of the Secretariat's resources. She suggested that it might be useful to try to augment the Secretariat's resources by creating an advisory body that would help identify areas for future expansion and determine what universities or associates the Secretariat might work with. She knew of a number of individuals from the university community in the United States who were experts in managing programmes at the university level who might be willing to participate and she suspected that other member countries processed a similar type of expertise. She did not think that that would be difficult to set up but felt that it might help Members to turn the courses into a sustainable projects for the future. She noted that Members had still not received the precise accounting of the regional trade policy courses held in Casablanca. Her authorities wished to receive those figures. Her delegation was pleased that progress had been made with respect to the draft 2003 TA Plan. Members needed to take careful note of the lessons learnt in terms of cost, implementation problems and feedback regarding course modules. More important, Members needed to ensure that cost effective programmes were being developed within the agreed budget. She asked the Secretariat how the critical assessment and quality evaluations would be built into the draft 2003 TA Plan. Her delegation wondered whether Members and the Secretariat could work with the beneficiary countries to get discounts for those travelling from the national airlines or receive the assistance of beneficiary Governments to ask for reduced rates at hotels or establishing budgetary guidelines such as the use of economy class only for all travel. Those were issues that her delegation felt that donors, recipients, WT/COMTD/M/43 Page 24 and the Secretariat could work on together to ensure that the funds available were being used in the most efficient way. Her delegation remained concerned about the overlap of the regional trade policy courses in Africa and the work of the Training Institute. Her delegation hoped to see more coordination within the Secretariat on the TA Plan, the training programmes, and the regional training courses. Her delegation wished to get answers to its questions before proceeding with the action on the draft 2003 TA Plan.","WTCOMTDM43.pdf","Secretariat, Nairobi, Casablanca, Secretariat, Secretariat, Secretariat, United, States, Members, Members, Casablanca, Members, Members, Secretariat, Members, Secretariat, Secretariat, Africa, Training, Institute, Secretariat"
"4640",4640,"6","6.       The representative of the United States sought the guidance of the Chairman on the way forward. Her delegation had simply sought to indicate that while notification to the CTD was an acceptable and important part of the process, there was a transparency obligation with respect to the notifications RTAs process. Her delegation did not believe that that process in total had been concluded by a notification to the CTD although that was the first step.","WTCOMTDM43.pdf","United, States, Chairman, CTD, CTD"
"4639",4639,"59","59.      The representative of the United States said that her delegation was willing to work expeditiously to ensure that the best possible TA would be delivered in the critical year of 2003. She had noted improvements to the revised 2003 TA Plan, not just in terms of the revised cost which represented a more realistic figure given the fact that many members were already at the end of their budget cycles. She hoped that the concerns raised by her delegation at the previous meeting of the CTD would be answered. She also had some additional questions. The cost analysis carried out for the draft 2003 TA Plan had been carefully reviewed by her authorities. She highlighted her delegation's concerns with respect to redundant activities. Her delegation wished Members to consider the 2002 TA Plan and learn lessons for the future. Progressive graduated programmes should be provided in order for the participants to the various activities to move up the skills chain. Getting more clarity regarding the level at which the different courses were being offered would help Members assess whether the needs of beneficiary countries were actually being met. Her delegation shared the view that providing Members with an evaluation as the plan progressed would provide greater accountability and account of the costs throughout the year. That would prevent Members from approving a plan without having all the data and the time needed to consider that data on activities implemented during the course of the previous year. It would therefore be useful to build in a periodic reporting process, possibly in the form of quarterly reports on the delivery of the 2003 TA Plan, both in terms of the quality, the number and the cost of the activities implemented. If money needed to be redirected because of shortfalls in the budget or cancelled activities, Members would discuss how that could be done and be actively engaged in the process throughout the year.","WTCOMTDM43.pdf","United, States, CTD, Members, Members, Members, Members, Members"
"4638",4638,"58","58.      The representative of Australia said that his delegation could support the broad thrust of the draft 2003 TA Plan, particularly its focus on effective participation in trade negotiations and the pursuit of trade integration activities. His delegation, like many others, was still interested in a proper audit and evaluation of the 2002 TA Plan which would be important in fine tuning the 2003 TA Plan and asked what the status of the 2002 audit was. He said that his delegation was interested in the possibility of outsourcing as an option for the delivery of some of the WTO TA activities. His delegation was also interested in the criteria that the Secretariat was currently using for outsourcing. His delegation looked forward to further discussions on outsourcing as it was an important option to consider, particularly in light of the pressure that the Secretariat was facing and which would increase in the period before the Fifth Ministerial Conference. His delegation appreciated the efforts that had been made to reduce the cost of the 2003 TA Plan. The new figure was more realistic and would help secure the appropriate support for the draft 2003 TA Plan from members' treasuries. His delegation was surprised that no reference had been made to the Pacific Islands, particularly in sections II and X of the draft 2003 TA Plan which identified regions that faced particular challenges. He was certain that Members were aware that the Asia and Pacific region was a key beneficiary of the Australian Government's development related activities, including TRTA. Within that region the South Pacific was an area in particular need which received special attention. Pacific island countries faced particular difficulties in adapting their economies to take advantage of increased global trade and economic integration. Three Pacific island countries were Members of the WTO which might not be evident as their officials rarely participated in WTO meetings. That underscored the difficulties that                                                                                      WT/COMTD/M/43                                                                                             Page 23 they, and other many small member countries, faced. In the Pacific there were particular problems relating to distance and the fact that the economies were small and remote from markets and vulnerable to natural disasters and economic forces. Having recognised the lack of any mention in the draft 2003 TA Plan of the Pacific islands, his delegation had used the period since the previous meeting to propose some language to the Secretariat which would rectify the situation and which his delegation was willing to circulate to all interested members. The Pacific islands needed to be included in the draft 2003 TA Plan because of their relevance to the work that his Government hoped to achieve through TRTA. Their inclusion was also important for his Government's support of the draft 2003 TA Plan.","WTCOMTDM43.pdf","Australia, WTO, Secretariat, Secretariat, Pacific, Islands, Members, Asia, South, Pacific, Members, WTO, WTO, Pacific, Pacific, Secretariat, Pacific, TRTA"
"4637",4637,"57","57.     He went on to say that his delegation supported the statement made by the representative of India regarding the proposed outreach activities in the draft 2002 TA Plan. He was not certain what the outreach activities implied but assumed that they involved familiarising parliamentarians and representatives of the civil society with WTO matters. Document WT/COMTD/W/104/Add.1/Rev.1 contained a total of twelve national and regional outreach activities, but his delegation was not aware of the amount of money that would be spent for that purpose. While his delegation appreciated the Secretariat's good intentions, he said that bringing a few parliamentarians attend a course for a few days in Geneva would not develop an understanding of WTO matters. It might rather create confusion about the negotiating process and the work of WTO. He therefore requested the Secretariat to exclude those types of awareness activities from the draft 2003 TA Plan and allocate the funds to areas which would contribute to the capacity building of LDCs. He said that it was clear from the evaluation report that the regional trade policy course held in Nairobi was regarded as highly effective. He requested the Secretariat to conduct a regional trade policy course in Bangladesh to allow the trade practitioners of the Asian region could better understand WTO matters.","WTCOMTDM43.pdf","India, WTO, Secretariat, Geneva, WTO, WTO, Secretariat, Nairobi, Secretariat, Bangladesh, WTO"
"4636",4636,"56","56.     The representative of Bangladesh said that his delegation realised that the revised 2003 TA Plan contained some adjustments to the national and regional activities. With the inclusion of two regional activities in the revised draft 2003 TA Plan the total number of activities had been increased from 441 to 443. In that sense his delegation did not see any major change in the revised 2003 TA Plan. His delegation had always emphasized that it was the quality rather than the quantity in the delivery of TA which would build true capacity. To develop real capacity the WTO Secretariat WT/COMTD/M/43 Page 22 needed to provide country specific support to LDCs. He hoped that the Secretariat would pay attention to that aspect when organising the courses listed in the draft 2003 TA Plan. His delegation was aware that the Secretariat had reduced the overall budget for the draft 2003 TA Plan from the original estimate of CHF 37 million to approximately CHF 24 million. Some activities that had been considered less valuable had surely been excluded. However, those could not be identified from the list that the Secretariat had provided. His delegation could not support the exclusion of activities that were important to LDCs, particularly in the context of the ongoing negotiations. He asked the Secretariat to identify the activities that had been excluded. He said that the Doha Ministerial Declaration repeatedly underscored the need for increased capacity building for LDCs and his delegation expected that more funds would be allocated for activities that helped develop the negotiating capacity of LDCs. He realised that the demand for TA was high and that it might be impossible for the WTO to meet all the demands due to the lack of human capacity and financial resources. However, his delegation believed that all activities that were useful to LDCs should be implemented and not jeopardized by funding problems. He said that he was particularly referring to the inclusion of institutional capacity building programmes for LDCs. His delegation had submitted a proposal for activities that would contribute to the strengthening of institutions in Bangladesh to deal with WTO issues. The Secretariat had informed his delegation that its proposals for TA would be considered in 2003 TA Plan and that steps had been taken to operationalise them.","WTCOMTDM43.pdf","Bangladesh, WTO, Secretariat, Secretariat, Secretariat, Secretariat, Secretariat, LDCs, WTO, LDCs, Bangladesh, WTO, Secretariat"
"4635",4635,"55","55.      He further said that his delegation was concerned about the outreach activities referred to in pages 28 and 29 of document WT/COMTD/W/104/Add.1/Rev.1. He shared the views expressed by the representative of India. Those activities might be useful to disseminate information on WTO issues to a wider audience and to other stakeholders. The implementation of those programmes was therefore to be undertaken by the External Relations Division, and not by any other division of the WTO. However, no matter how well intentioned those programmes might be, his delegation did not understand why they should form part of the budget for TRTA. TRTA was driven by the DDA which required an in depth understanding of the WTO agreements and rules by actual negotiators. The TA that Members were considering for 2003 should concentrate only on developing the capacity of the member countries in relation to the negotiations and the implementation of the WTO Agreements. As the proposed outreach activities did not target the needs of the relevant participants in that process, he urged that those activities be handled under a different programme and that scarce resources for TA not be spent on them. He said that his delegation was prepared to recommend the CTD to accept the revised 2003 TA Plan so that it could be forwarded to the Budget Committee with the following conditions. First, additional activities for the LDCs would be taken up at a later date and, if necessary, additional funds be sought for that purpose. Second, the target budget for TRTA in 2003 be increased back to CHF 37 million so as to facilitate the inclusion of activities for LDCs that had not been included earlier. Third, the WTO should pay increasing attention to developing institutional capacities in LDCs to enable them to deal with WTO matters. Fourth, the outreach activities should not form part of the 2003 TA Plan. Preferably, the External Relations Division, or any other division could propose those activities to the Budget Committee, but scarce funds for the TRTA programme should not be diverted for such purposes.","WTCOMTDM43.pdf","India, WTO, WTO, TRTA, DDA, WTO, Members, WTO, CTD, Budget, Committee, LDCs, TRTA, LDCs, WTO, WTO, Budget, Committee"
"4634",4634,"54","54.       The representative of Tanzania said that TRTA was vital for the LDCs and his delegation therefore had a vested interest in the activities that were being proposed in the 2003 TA Plan. He said that at the meeting of the CTD held on 11 November 2002, the Ambassador of Zambia, as coordinator of the LDC Group had reminded Members that the Uruguay Round Agreements specifically highlighted the importance that should be attached to TRTA for LDCs. That point had been re- emphasized at every Ministerial Conference and important meeting since the conclusion of the Uruguay Round. At the Doha Ministerial Conference TRTA had again found a place of prominence and the LDCs were viewing the 2003 TA Plan within that framework. Many LDCs had submitted their TA requests for 2003 to the Secretariat. Some had requested traditional seminars and workshops and others had requested activities that were more meaningful and went beyond that. Some Members had requested institutional support to strengthen their institutional capacity to implement the WTO Agreements and to participate effectively in the negotiating process. His delegation was pleased with the presence of Director-General Dr. Supachai when the CTD had first considered the 2003 TA Plan at its meeting on 8 October 2002. Dr. Supachai had outlined his vision for meaningful TRTA for LDCs. His delegation was pleased with Dr. Supachai's address and the fact that he took personal interest in the subject. When the details of the 2003 TA Plan had been put before Members, his delegation had noted that most of the LDC requests had not been taken into account by the Secretariat. Only three activities per LDC had been included in the draft 2003 TA                                                                                      WT/COMTD/M/43                                                                                             Page 21 Plan. Though that was disappointing, his delegation recognized the Secretariat's resource constraints. Given the Secretariat's limited capacity and the concerns expressed by the development partners, the Secretariat would not be able to implement a 2003 TA Plan which exceeded CHF 37 million. Although his delegation would have preferred a higher allocation for TRTA in the 2003 TA Plan, it was prepared to accept that as a compromise. At the meeting of the CTD held on 11 November 2002, DDG Abbott had informed Members that the revised 2003 TA Plan would only require funding amounting to CHF 24 million. His delegation was deeply concerned about that statement. First, it was not clear to his delegation which activities had been deleted to reduce the cost. It appeared that it was mainly the Geneva-based activities that had been removed. His delegation was of the view that some of the Geneva-based activities, for example the WTO internship programme, were effective means of capacity building for LDCs and should not be sacrificed under any circumstances. It was of interest for Members to see the list of deleted activities to ensure that no important activities were being excluded from the 2003 TA Plan in an attempt to reduce the cost. TA was a recurrent theme in the Doha Ministerial Declaration. Many members had emphasized that the rationale for the TRTA in the Doha Ministerial Declaration was to enable developing countries to understand the substance of the negotiations and to meaningfully participate in them. The initial cost estimate of CHF 37 million for the 2003 TA Plan was in reality a meagre amount compared to the large amounts that were being spent elsewhere. He urged that those activities for LDCs that had not been included earlier be included and, if necessary, by recourse to a supplementary budgetary allocation beyond the current request for CHF 24 million. The Secretariat had to clearly state how it planned to handle the question of strengthening institutions in LDCs, to enable them to deal with WTO matters more effectively on a long-term basis.","WTCOMTDM43.pdf","Tanzania, TRTA, LDCs, CTD, Ambassador, Zambia, LDC, Group, Members, Uruguay, Uruguay, Round, Doha, Ministerial, Conference, TRTA, LDCs, Secretariat, Members, WTO, Director-General, Supachai, CTD, Supachai, Supachai, Members, Secretariat, LDC, Secretariat, Secretariat, Secretariat, TRTA, CTD, DDG, Abbott, Members, WTO, LDCs, Members, TRTA, Secretariat, WTO"
"4633",4633,"53","53.      He went on to say that this his delegation welcomed the efforts to limit ad hoc activities to 5 per cent of the total activities. He recognised the need for flexibility but was surprised that as much as 28 per cetn of the activities organised by the Secretariat in 2002 were ad hoc activities. He suggested that when ad hoc requests were received they be consolidated and put forward to the CTD for approval. If for any reason an ad hoc activities had to be organised at short notice, he suggested that the views of the Chairman of the CTD be considered before the activity was organised. His delegation supported the fact that 47 percent of the planned national TA activities for 2002 would be directed to LDCs who required TA more than any other group of countries. He agreed with the statement in document WT/COMTD/W/104/Rev.1 that TA was not a substitute for market access and added that TA was not a substitute for accession. Accession was important for some LDCs and his delegation hoped that a decision could soon be reached in order to facilitate faster accession of LDCs into the WTO. In implementing the 2003 TA Plan reference was made to cooperation with the Bretton Woods Institutions and six Regional Development Banks. He sought clarification as to how that would function in practise and in what way the Secretariat depended on those institutions to assist in the delivery of TA activities.               He said that paragraph 41 of the document (WT/COMTD/W/104/Rev.1) made reference to the role that countries like India and Sri Lanka could play in the delivery of TA and sought clarification as to what the Secretariat had in mind in that respect. His Government had responded positively to suggestions made by the Secretariat about a year earlier but there had been no subsequent follow up. He informed Members that his Government, within its limited means, did extend some TA to other countries. His delegation welcomed the idea of including a module on S&D in WTO training activities and he suggested that the contents of the module be circulated in the Special Session of the CTD. Such a module would be useful in providing an insight into what the principles and objectives of S&D were. With respect to the internship programme for regional coordinators, he said that the document mentioned that regional coordinators would be selected by the regional organisations concerned. There were two slots provided for the South Asia Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC), but since SAARC did not have a coordinator he asked which member state of SAARC Secretariat had been consulted to identify the two countries that had been listed.","WTCOMTDM43.pdf","Secretariat, CTD, Chairman, CTD, WTO, Secretariat, India, Sri, Lanka, Secretariat, Secretariat, Members, WTO, CTD, South, Asia, Association, for, Regional, Cooperation, SAARC, SAARC, SAARC, Secretariat"
"4632",4632,"52","52.      The representative of India thanked donors for their support for the 2002 TA activities, which he hoped would continue in 2003. His delegation had noted that the projected cost for the draft 2003 TA Plan had fallen from CHF 36.5 million to CHF 24.6 million. He said that DDG Abbot had, at the last meeting of the CTD, explained how the cost for the 2003 TA Plan could be reduced. His delegation asked for further details regarding the calculation of those cost estimates as he noted that the costs had fallen by almost a third while the number of activities remained more or less the same. The Secretariat had provided Members with an evaluation of the regional policy courses, but his delegation looked forward to also receiving an evaluation of the remaining activities carried out in 2002. With respect to the costing of TA activities, he said that the 13% overhead charge was supposed to cover the costs incurred by the Secretariat in organising the activities. That would include not only the overheads but also the cost of the time spent by Secretariat officials in organising the activities. In the Budget Committee, Members had been informed that 19 L-posts had been created to assist in the delivery of the TA activities. If the cost of maintaining those posts was charged to the TA budget then he did not see the justification for continuing to charge 13 per cent in overhead costs to the technical cooperation budget. It should be substantially less than that and he sought clarification as to why a 13 per cent overhead cost continued to be charged. He said that the last bullet point on page 13 of document WT/COMTD/W/104/Rev.1 stated that ""a TA/CB Programme Menu is under policy development"" and that ""Country priority preferences will be fit under the Programme Menu, which falls into 7 categories"" the first of which was outreach. The representative of Kenya commented on that at the previous meeting of the CTD and the Secretariat had clarified the situation by drawing upon paragraph 10 of the Doha Ministerial Declaration. At a previous meeting of the CTD, held on 8 October 2002, his delegation, while agreeing with the usefulness of such activities, noted that costs of such programmes should not be included in the budget of the TA plan. Outreach programmes could not be classified as TA. Ministers had clearly defined that ""The delivery of WTO TA shall be designed to assist developing and least-developed countries and low-income countries in transition to adjust to WTO rules and disciplines, implement obligations and exercise the rights of membership, including drawing on the benefits of an open, rules-based multilateral trading system.1"" Paragraph 6 on page 6 of document WT/COMTD/W/104.Rev.1 stated that ""The challenge of the 2003 WTO Annual Plan for TA/CB is to build capacity in the beneficiary countries for effective negotiations, legal implementation of WTO Agreements, and trade integration."" He did not see how outreach activities fitted into that. While his delegation supported the organisation of the suggested outreach activities, they should not be included as part of the 2003 TA Plan. That would result in less money being available for TA activities than would otherwise have been the case. He pointed out that references to TA in paragraph 41 of the Doha Ministerial Declaration did not include 1     WT/MIN(01)/DEC/W/1 WT/COMTD/M/43 Page 20 paragraph 10 that dealt with outreach activities. Ministers therefore had not intended that the outreach activities be part of the TA programme. His delegation therefore sought the deletion of the complete list of the outreach activities from the 2003 TA Plan. He found it surprising that there had been no reference made to TA activities in the index that had been prepared for document WT/COMTD/W/104/Rev.1 despite his delegation's referral to that in the previous meeting of the CTD.","WTCOMTDM43.pdf","India, Abbot, CTD, Secretariat, Members, Secretariat, Secretariat, Budget, Committee, Members, Kenya, CTD, Secretariat, CTD, TA, WTO, WTO, WTO, WTO, CTD"

Discussions on the draft Annual Report had also been suspended and he hoped that the Committee would be in a position to adopt the report at the end of the meeting.

In addition, the Secretariat had provided general information on notifications made under the Enabling Clause. He was therefore not certain how the Committee could proceed further with that issue. 5.      Several references have been made to the allocation of resources for TA activities, and the impact of the planned activities on the Secretariat's capacity to deliver. These considerations are equally valid in terms of the work of TCA. If the kind of evaluation activities Members seem to be WT/COMTD/M/43 Page 46 demanding are to be possible, the monitoring and evaluation function needs to be strengthened, and more resources allocated to it. At the present time there is only one professional staff member assigned to these duties. The limitations this places on the scope of monitoring and evaluation activities are clear. 20 November 2002                                            __________","WTCOMTDM43.pdf","India, RTA, India, Sri, Lanka, CTD, Secretariat, Committee, Secretariat, TCA, Members"

The aim had been to write a simple, factual report on the work of the CTD in regular and dedicated session as well as of the work of the Sub-Committee on LDCs. Delegations were requested to either take the floor or inform him or the Secretariat of any changes they might wish to see before noon, Thursday, 14 November 2002. He said that Members needed to adopt the Annual Report on Monday, 18 November 2002. He said that he did not think that delegations would have much difficulty to adopt the report as it was factual in nature.","WTCOMTDM43.pdf","Chairman, CTD, Secretariat, Members"

The Secretariat would then provide responses to the questions raised by the representative of the European Communities.","WTCOMTDM43.pdf","Chairman, CTD, Secretariat"
"4626",4626,"47","47.      He went on to the question of setting priorities within the 2003 TA Plan and said that although there should be a special focus on LDCs, his delegation had noted many instances where national and regional activities were planned on the same subject. He asked whether that was a prioritisation of activities in view of the scarce resources available. He also sought more information on the human resource implications of the trade clinics. He asked who was going to do what and how they were going to be planned if they constituted a significant part of the work to be carried out in 2003. His delegation hoped that the Secretariat could concentrate more on managing TA than actually delivering it. Issues relating to strategic partnerships and outsourcing had already been addressed by the Secretariat. With respect to ad hoc activities he said that the text in page 9 of document WT/COMTD/W/104/Rev.1 reflected real progress and a serious effort to address the issue WT/COMTD/M/43 Page 18 in a systematic matter. His delegation fully supported the attempt to discipline the number of ad-hoc activities. However, his delegation did not believe that any proposed replacement activity should be automatically accepted because there were other parameters of the TA Plan that still applied. For example, all activities still had to be mainstreamed and be compatible with the priorities of the Plan. Regarding the strategic partnerships, he said that it was a good sign that they were more thoroughly mentioned and that new activities involving the ITC and other organisations had been included. He asked whether the strategic partnerships mentioned had already been transposed into additional activities and enhanced cooperation in the list of activities in document WT/COMTD/W/104/Add.1 and whether they had already had an effect on the cost. He asked what the Secretariat would be doing with respect to the other organisations. With respect to the 2002 TA Plan he said that Members needed to get a better sense of how much had been provided by other organisations in order to be able to judge whether the approach in the draft 2003 TA Plan was realistic. On outsourcing, he said that he had been struck by the fact that the Secretariat felt that it had to be cost efficient. That was only one of the benefits when outsourcing. If an activity could be delivered by another organisation at the same cost then outsourcing would still alleviate the burden falling on the WTO Secretariat, provided the other organisation was one that the Secretariat and the Members were comfortable with. The Secretariat did not necessarily have to save money. However outsourcing should not be more expensive. Outsourcing was also a means to enable the Secretariat to concentrate on what its first priority should be, particularly in 2003. He said that there had to be more than two other organisations to which the Secretariat could outsource and his delegation looked forward to finding additional trustworthy partners. With respect to the regional trade policy courses held in Africa he said that his delegation was still considering the evaluation (WT/COMTD/W/107). He had been struck by the mixed conclusion in paragraph 91 which stated that ""There are no convincing grounds to argue that the African regional trade policy courses did not do what they set out to do."" That was a negative statement but the summary in paragraph 14 was more positive. He said that the report still gave rise to a number of questions. One was how Members could ensure that all tools were ready and all questions answered in order to factor in the experiences from 2002 into the 2003 regional trade policy courses into the 2003 TA Plan which his delegation supported in principle. He asked what the programme for the 2003 courses would look like and whether it would be possible to hold the courses in the Summer of 2003, just before the Fifth Ministerial Conference. He was not certain that government officials would be able to attend and that the Secretariat would be prepared to provide the necessary resources in that period. If the course was held in a different period, it would have different implications for the housing, the institutions available and the willingness of people to participate. He concluded by saying that his delegation was grateful for the attempt that had been made to reduce the cost of the 2003 TA Plan. He said that it was important to get the substance of the 2003 TA Plan right first. The issue of its cost could be considered once the answers to the questions raised had been given.","WTCOMTDM43.pdf","Secretariat, Secretariat, ITC, Secretariat, Members, Secretariat, WTO, Secretariat, Secretariat, Members, Secretariat, Secretariat, Secretariat, Africa, Members, Secretariat"
"4625",4625,"46","46.      The representative of the European Communities said that considerable progress had been made on the 2003 TA Plan following Members' discussions. He said that the Government of Germany had announced a pledge for 2003 and 2004 which would contribute to moving the issue of TA fast and productively. The 2003 TA Plan was a big programme and there were many issues at stake, some of which related to the experiences in 2002 and some which related to how those lessons would be reflected in the 2003 TA Plan. He said that he would pose some questions in order to get a better understanding of the different issues. His delegation agreed with the representative of Switzerland that it was important for Members to base themselves, as mentioned in paragraph 4 of document WT/COMTD/W/104/Rev.1 on the lessons learnt, the facts and information on the delivery of the 2002 TA Plan. He encouraged the Secretariat to provide Members with a report on the implementation of the 2002 TA Plan as soon as possible as basis for further discussions. With respect to the approximately 25 per cent of the activities that had been cancelled, he asked how that would be factored in into the 2003 TA Plan. He said that the reasons given for the cancellation of some of those activities were bound to reproduce themselves. The Fifth Ministerial Conference would put a lot of pressure on Members and there would thus be absorption problems with a risk of less activities being executed than planned. His delegation was still concerned about the capacity within the Secretariat to deliver the 2003 TA Plan. Members needed to realise that there would be a first real intense phase of negotiations before the Fifth Ministerial Conference in Cancun, and that the Secretariat would also have to fully service the negotiations. There was also the issue of quality versus quantity. If the Secretariat intended to focus on the quality of the activities delivered then there would be greater human resource needs for the implementation of the 2003 TA Plan than in the delivery of the 2002 TA Plan. He gave the example of the 50-60 activities in the 2002 TA Plan which only involved the travel to a conference. The Secretariat might find it difficult to replace those by more resource intensive activities.","WTCOMTDM43.pdf","European, Communities, Members, Germany, Switzerland, Members, Secretariat, Members, Members, Secretariat, Members, Cancun, Secretariat, Secretariat, Secretariat"
"4624",4624,"45","45.       The representative of Paraguay said that he was making his statement on behalf of the GRULAC. He referred to the importance of the results of the regional trade policy courses held in Africa and said that document WT/COMTD/W/107 provided a good summary of the evaluation of those courses. His delegation believed that the regional trade policy courses were important because they offered the opportunity to attend trade policy courses in Geneva, to officials who would otherwise not have that opportunity. As had been mentioned by the representative of Barbados it would be important to organise such courses for countries in the GRULAC region. Although there was still a debate as to whether the courses should take place as set out in paragraph 92 of document WT/COMTD/W/107, light had been shed on the proposal made by the GRULAC as reflected in paragraph 4 on page 5 which referred to the ""Lessons from the implementation of the 2002 Annual TA/CB Plan"" and contained important aspects which were in line with the group's proposal. Those aspects included the recognition that the demand for TA was limitless and went beyond supply, and that it therefore was important to rationalise work and collaborate with other institutions. In order to meet the commitments set out by Ministers at the Doha Ministerial Conference, it was essential to establish clearly identified associations with other institutions in coordination with donor countries                                                                                     WT/COMTD/M/43                                                                                            Page 17 and to take advantage of the synergies created. Paragraph 4 also pointed out that recipient countries had already set their priorities and expressed a greater need for capacity building for trade integration (stimulating supply-side responses and export diversification) relative to capacity building for short term TA/CB for WTO negotiations. In that regard, the WTO could not deliver except through co- ordinated arrangements with development agencies and bilateral donors, and the recipient countries themselves. Bullet point 11 in paragraph 4 stated that ""there is a threshold capacity of the WTO Secretariat to deliver TA. This capacity threshold was attained in 2002."" He said that it was important to consider the experiences of those courses of which he had been a participant. He hoped that in 2003, within the framework of the Latin American Association and the Development Bank possibilities of holding courses in the GRULAC region could be discussed and different countries could host the long term courses. The main thrust of the GRULAC's proposal was reflected in paragraph 2 on page 1 of document WT/COMTD/W/107, which called for the increase in the number of government officials who could benefit from the long-term trade policy courses, giving a regional focus to the learning dispensed in those courses and the establishment of partnership arrangements with regionally based institutions of higher learning and local resource persons in order to ensure the transfer of knowledge in a sustainable manner.","WTCOMTDM43.pdf","Paraguay, Africa, Geneva, Barbados, GRULAC, Doha, Ministerial, Conference, WTO, WTO, WTO, Secretariat, Latin, American, Association, Development, Bank, GRULAC"

"4622",4622,"43","43.      Mr. Osakwe, Director, Technical Cooperation Division, thanked the representative of Japan for bringing to Members' attention the commitment made by the Government of Japan to provide resources to UNCTAD for activities on trade and investment carried out jointly with the WTO. He said that he would be pleased to report that to the Director-General and senior management. He said that the activities on trade and investment carried out in 2002 had gone well. UNCTAD had been responsible for and delivered four regional training activities in 2002. The WTO had delivered three of the four regional workshops which it was responsible for. The final one for the Anglophone African countries was to be held in Botswana. However, due to scheduling problems it would only be held in January 2003. He said that the Government of Japan had made the Secretariat's task easier with the trade and investment activities held back to back with the meetings of the Working Group on Trade and Investment that had been held in 2002 and those proposed for 2003. The Secretariat did not foresee any particular difficulties with the activities on investment. The challenge for all activities was posed by the large number of individual country requests for national activities in one particular area, which could not be delivered. In that case the Secretariat would attempt to collapse such demands for national activities into regional activities. He said that the back to back activities mentioned by the representative of Japan would normally be regarded as ad hoc activities, but it would be possible to accommodate them in the planning process by having early contacts on in order to schedule them. The Secretariat could schedule back to back activities with planned activities but that information had to be made available before the implementation year as they otherwise would cause unforeseen pressure. With respect to the regional trade policy courses, he said that two donor countries had approached the Secretariat and were willing to provide institutions in Asia and the Caribbean with the possibility to hold trade policy courses like the ones that had been held in Africa. The Secretariat was responding favourably to that and would report to Members. In response to the question posed with respect to the internal note on the guidelines on trade clinics, he said that that note was an operational document. However, the Secretariat would consult with interested members before putting it before senior management for approval.","WTCOMTDM43.pdf","Osakwe, Director, Technical, Cooperation, Division, Japan, Members, Japan, WTO, Director-General, UNCTAD, WTO, Botswana, Japan, Secretariat, Working, Group, on, Trade, and, Investment, Secretariat, Secretariat, Japan, Secretariat, Secretariat, Asia, Caribbean, Africa, Secretariat, Members, Secretariat"
"4621",4621,"42","42.      The representative of Japan said that his delegation was willing to cooperate with the Secretariat in order to finalise the draft 2003 TA Plan so that activities could begin to be delivered by the start of 2003. He said that he would limit his intervention to six points. First, he said that among the reasons for the slippages from the 2003 TA Plan were the problems of joint delivery with other international organisations. His delegation had emphasised the importance of collaborating with other international agencies and his Government had made a commitment to financially support UNCTAD to jointly implement activities related to trade and investment to the Asia-Pacific member countries. He said that it was his delegation's understanding that that commitment had not been taken advantage of, and asked the Secretariat what the problem was, besides a lack of funding. Second, his delegation appreciated that the Secretariat had made an effort to address its concerns with respect to ad hoc activities. His Government had made an effort to mainstream TRTA in the context in its bilateral technical cooperation. He provided the example of the two day workshops that his Government had organised with the WTO in order to jointly implement certain trade and investment activities in Geneva. Those two-day workshops had caused concerns in terms of cost effectiveness. However he was pleased to mention that his Government bore 65 per cent of the cost of those activities. The workshops would be held back to back with the Working Group on Trade and Investment. His Government would cover the travel costs for participants from Anglophone African countries. He asked whether that type of activity was considered to be an ad hoc activity. Third, with respect to the regional trade policy courses, he said that he agreed with the representative of Switzerland that the selection of partner institutions was crucial and had to be transparent. The selection process had to be strategic because one of the main objectives of regional trade policy courses was to develop partnership arrangements and help in the creation of future institutions which could take over the responsibilities of the WTO in those countries. Fourth, with respect to the training module on S&D, he asked whether that activity related to what was being discussed in the Special Session of the CTD. Fifth, he asked what the nature of the internal note on trade clinics would be. He asked whether the WT/COMTD/M/43 Page 16 guidelines were going to be circulated to Members for comments or whether it was work in progress. Sixth, with respect to CRP(02)41 he said that his delegation had been surprised by the initial high budget figures for the draft 2003 TA Plan but was ready to study the revised figures. He did not agree with the suggestion made by the representative of Switzerland to change the 13 per cent overhead costs to real accounting figures. His experience was that such management would pose administration burdens on the Secretariat. What was required was transparency with respect to the overhead costs.","WTCOMTDM43.pdf","Japan, Secretariat, UNCTAD, Asia-Pacific, Secretariat, Secretariat, TRTA, WTO, Geneva, Working, Group, on, Trade, and, Investment, Switzerland, WTO, S&D, CTD, Members, Switzerland, Secretariat"
"4620",4620,"41","41.     He went on to say that the LDCs were encouraged by the Secretariat's receptiveness to their suggestion to incorporate seven principles that they had devised into the revised 2003 TA Plan. Those principles related to the mandate of other international or regional agencies in the area of development-related issues which transcended the mandate of the WTO. The LDCs believed that making those principles an integral part of the 2003 TA Plan would go a long way in addressing their developmental concerns and interests. The statement regarding those principles had been distributed and was available to Members. He reiterated what those principles were, as the Secretariat had noted in document WT/COMTD/W/104/Rev.1, in terms of where the competency of both the WTO Secretariat and the other agencies lay and the priority which should be given to the needs of developing countries, in particular the LDCs. That meant that any assistance involving development and negotiating issues which went beyond the WTO legal framework should be based on close cooperation between the WTO and other development-oriented agencies. In that regard, the LDCs were of the view that in the future, the WTO TA Plans should always identify which activities required collaboration with other international agencies including the regional ones, and devise ways to implement them. He said that paragraph 2 (v) of the Decision on Measures in Favour of Least-Developed Countries stated that ""Least-developed countries shall be accorded substantially increased TA in the development, strengthening and diversification of their production and export bases including those of services, as well as in trade promotion, to enable them to maximize the benefits from liberalized access to markets."" He added that paragraph 30 on page 15 of WT/COMTD/W/104/Rev.1 stated that ""The 49 Least-Developed Countries have priority focus. They have the most urgent and acute trade development needs."" He mentioned that to encourage the Secretariat to reflect those principles in the activities and distribution of resources in the 2003 TA Plan. He concluded by requesting that the principles be translated into tangible benefits for LDCs.","WTCOMTDM43.pdf","LDCs, Secretariat, WTO, LDCs, Members, Secretariat, WTO, Secretariat, WTO, WTO, LDCs, WTO, Secretariat"
"4619",4619,"40","40.      The representative of Zambia said that his delegation was pleased that the evaluation of the 2002 TA Plan had noted the success of the regional trade policy course that had been held in Nairobi. The fact that the budget figures had been reduced while the TA commitments still would be fulfilled was a success in financial management and planning. He said that it was important to consider the TA principles in relation to the needs of the LDCs. The WTO Plans were part of an evolving process. There had to be a common understanding of what the LDCs should expect before the details were discussed. He drew Members' attention to bullet point 6 of paragraph 4 on page 5 of document WT/COMTD/W/104/Rev.1 which stated that ""recipient countries have re-emphasized their preferred priorities in their TA/CB requests. Greater need has been expressed for capacity building for trade integration (stimulating supply-side responses, export diversification, etc)"". The bullet point went on to acknowledge that the WTO could not, except through co-ordinated arrangements with development agencies, bilateral donors and recipient countries themselves, deliver all of that on its own. He said that the table on page three of the same document indicated where the WTO could provide TA. He wished to discuss some of the principles for the WTO TA in that context. He would also consider the details reflected in the 2003 TA Plan. He informed the Committee that the LDCs had discussed their position at the 30th Session of the Sub-Committee on LDCs held on 7 November 2002. He thanked the Secretariat for its positive responses and comments regarding the statement made and issues raised by the LDCs at that meeting, and in particular for the steps that the WTO would take to ensure that UNCTAD and ITC were included in the 2003 TA Plan as WTO strategic partners, in order to address LDCs' concerns and interests that fell under their respective mandates which were different from the mandate of the WTO. His delegation welcomed the statement that the WTO Secretariat was ready to translate the policy statement made by the heads of the three agencies at their meeting held in Geneva on 30 October 2002, in which the heads of the agencies pledged ""to enhance their relationship across a range of activities including TRTA, research and the sharing of information"". He believed that that statement was broad enough to be incorporated into specific operational steps in the revised 2003 TA Plan. The 2003 TA Plan offered an opportunity for immediate implementation of that policy statement and encouraged the Secretariat to devise                                                                                     WT/COMTD/M/43                                                                                            Page 15 practical ways and means to achieve that objective. He hoped that the Secretariat would inform WTO Members on the arrangements made in that respect.","WTCOMTDM43.pdf","Zambia, Nairobi, WTO, Members, WTO, WTO, TA, WTO, Committee, LDCs, Secretariat, LDCs, WTO, UNCTAD, ITC, WTO, WTO, WTO, Secretariat, Geneva, Secretariat, Secretariat, WTO, Members"

One delegation made reference to the desirability of focusing part of the annual evaluation on ad hoc activities in order to be able to take an informed view of the degree of flexibility with which the TA plan should be allowed to accommodate such activities. This will be difficult to do in respect of the 2002 plan since TCA has been focusing more on the ""regular"" part of the plan than on ad hoc activities. However, if Members desire, more attention can be paid in 2003 to such activities with a view to providing information in the Annual Report for that year. It would indeed be interesting to be able to compare ad hoc activities with planned ones in terms of impact, responsiveness and effectiveness.","WTCOMTDM43.pdf","United, States, RTA, India, Sri, Lanka, CRTA, TCA, Members"

Although they could not be expected to solve the development problems in Africa, they would help African officials familiarise themselves with the WTO rules. The three-month courses, the courses for LDCs and the three-week trade policy courses were all good examples of useful TA with which his delegation was satisfied. He agreed that it was important to involve regional development associations, but also to closely involve the host country in the preparations of the regional trade policy courses in order to avoid any problems. He hoped that the regional trade policy courses would be maintained in order to favour the integration of African country members into the multilateral trading system.","WTCOMTDM43.pdf","Djibouti, Africa, Africa, WTO, LDCs"
"4616",4616,"38","38.      Mr. Osakwe, Director, Technical Cooperation Division, said said that with respect to the outreach activities, Members should recall that WTO TA was member priority driven and that several of the outreach activities had been explicitly requested by members. The activities were also designed on the basis of mandates contained in paragraphs 10 and 38 of the Doha Ministerial Declaration. With respect to the NEPAD, he said that the WTO Secretariat had consulted with several delegates from Africa as well as the NEPAD Secretariat and the wording in the 2003 TA Plan reflected what had been agreed in those consultations. He agreed with the representative of Kenya that there needed to be a balance between the NEPAD continental wide activities and the NEPAD national activities. He said that the NEPAD Secretariat had undertaken to revert to the WTO Secretariat with in-country activities on a country to country basis, on which the Secretariat would report to Members. With respect to the JITAP programme he said that it was still under consultation between the ITC, UNCTAD and WTO Secretariats and the donor community. However, the WTO Secretariat was confident that a satisfactory solution would be found. He thanked the representative of Kenya for endorsing the Secretariat's guiding principle that TA Plans should be an integral part of national development plans.","WTCOMTDM43.pdf","Osakwe, Director, Technical, Cooperation, Division, Members, WTO, WTO, Secretariat, Africa, Secretariat, Kenya, Secretariat, WTO, Secretariat, Secretariat, Members, ITC, UNCTAD, WTO, WTO, Secretariat, Kenya, Secretariat"
"4615",4615,"37","37.     The representative of Kenya said that document WT/COMTD/W/104/Rev.1 reminded Members of the need to integrate TA into national development plans. That document contained other useful information and members needed to go through and familiarise themselves with the points raised in the document. The revised 2003 TA Plan included a second phase of the JITAP programme which was of great importance to Africa. He asked the Secretariat to provide clarification as to what that programme would include. He said that the eight beneficiary countries that had experienced the first phase of the programme had benefited from all the activities in the programme. Each activity played a different role and asking members to choose a few out of the listed activities could pose problems, especially for new beneficiaries entering the programme. He said that his delegation was pleased that NEPAD was included in the draft 2003 TA Plan. He said that the NEPAD went beyond trade and his delegation felt that giving the NEPAD a regional approach such as through regional trading arrangements would have been more appropriate for the WTO than starting at the continental level. He asked the Secretariat to provide more information in that respect. With respect to the report given by Mr. Rolian, he said that his delegation was pleased with the results of the regional trade policy courses held in Nairobi. His delegation did not share the views of the representative of Morocco because the Government of Kenya had been fully involved in the organisation of the course and the selection of the partner institution that had worked together with the WTO Secretariat. Given the constraints faced by the Secretariat, his delegation felt that good work had been done and his Government looked forward to continued cooperation in the future. One of the objectives with the regional courses was institutional capacity building so that the role of the WTO could be reduced as the organisation of those courses progressed. That would ensure that the requisite capacity would be built in those countries to enable them to participate fully in the multilateral trading system. He was therefore pleased that the report contained a recommendation for the continuation of the regional trade policy course in Nairobi and his delegation looked forward to the beginning of the second course. He said that his delegation was pleased that the figures for the 2003 TA budget had been revised from CHF 37,463,415 to CHF 24,611,225 which should also be appreciated by the donors. He suggested adding a column to the 2003 TA Plan containing the cost of each activity so as to give Members an idea of it. His delegation believed that there should be more focus on long-term trade policy courses rather than 2-3 day workshops and seminars. He drew Members' attention to the outreach activities on page 29 of document WT/COMTD/W/104/Add.1/Rev.1. He thought that the limited resources available should not be overstretched. It was his impression that resources were being directed towards national parliaments and civil societies instead of addressing the core problems of building capacity within the relevant economic ministries in developing country members like Kenya. Converting some of the outreach courses into one or two regional trade policy courses would be cost effective in terms of utilising the funds available for TA. He said that the outreach courses might be necessary but he did not see how they fitted in the context of TA to his country. He asked the Secretariat to provide more information on those courses.

"4614",4614,"36","36.     The representative of Barbados said that she, at that time, only wished to comment on the Regional Trade Policy Courses. One positive aspect of the trade policy courses held in Nairobi and Casablanca were the important focus on regional issues. Only that type of regional exercise could bring real regional identification and specialization. Another positive aspect was the obvious usefulness of training the trainers which made the development effort sustainable. A third aspect was the positive returns on institutional partnerships and the obvious outcome of strengthened capacity and resources of academic institutions in Members with regard to WTO-related issues. Finally, it was a useful learning exercise for the WTO itself. Lessons from regional trade policy courses could be brought back to Geneva to broaden the perspectives of people working in Geneva. Past experiences should be used for the future. It was also necessary to extend the courses to other regions in 2003.

There were several reasons for that. First, it was widely acknowledged that the Caribbean region was one which faced specific challenges due to smallness and capacity constraints, particular institutional capacity restraints. Second, the region comprised a fairly homogenous pool of beneficiaries which made it easy to target and fashion the course. Third, there was an established university in the region, the University of the West Indies, which had a network of campuses located throughout the countries of the region. Those campuses would be natural partners to a regional trade policy course. Finally, there were several existing regional institutions such as the Caribbean Development Bank, the Caribbean Community Secretariat, within the region which could help in the needs analysis which would have to be undertaken in the formulation of the course modules. The was already a MOU between the WTO and the latter. It was for those reasons that her delegation wished to see the Secretariat give favourable consideration to the extension of the regional trade policy courses to other regions, including the Caribbean. The regional trade policy courses should be maintained as a training tool as it was a useful one.","WTCOMTDM43.pdf","Barbados, Nairobi, Casablanca, Members, WTO, Geneva, Geneva, Caribbean, Community, Caribbean, University, of, the, West, Indies, Caribbean, Development, Bank, Caribbean, Community, Secretariat, MOU, WTO, Secretariat, Caribbean"
"4613",4613,"35","35.      Mr. Osakwe, Director, Technical Cooperation Division, said that the African Trade Policy Courses constituted a staff burden on the Secretariat staff. What senior management had decided, and which was reflected in the first bullet of paragraph 22 of WT/COMTD/W/104/Add.1, was that those two African Trade Policy Courses would be Secretariat wide activities. The burden of their implementation would not be posed on one division. The implementation of those courses would be directly supervised by the Deputy Director-General Dr. Rana with the assistance of the Technical Cooperation Division and the Training Institute. However, the staff burden would be distributed evenly across the Secretariat staff. Secondly, and related to the proposals that DDG Mr. Abbott had made to the Budget Committee with regard to all WTO Secretariat staffing, was the need to have the 19 L positions renewed as quickly as possible. The second question raised related to the mix of instruments for TA activities. Members had urged the Secretariat early in 2002 to ask Members and Observers to state their needs. The needs identified by Members and Observers were diverse. They did not only relate to three-months courses. Some Members were interested in such courses, whereas others requested five days courses or explicitly insisted on two to three week trade policy courses. As the demands spanned across a wide range of activities and Members had requested the Secretariat to base the activities delivered on the explicit priorities of the Membership, the delivery had to be diverse as well. He finally said that it was up for Members to decide if the future design of activities should be based on evaluation results.","WTCOMTDM43.pdf","Osakwe, Director, Technical, Cooperation, Division, African, Trade, Policy, Courses, Secretariat, Secretariat, Director-General, Rana, Technical, Cooperation, Division, Training, Institute, Secretariat, Abbott, Budget, Committee, WTO, Secretariat, Members, Secretariat, Members, Members, Members, Members, Secretariat, Members"
"4612",4612,"34","34.     Deputy Director-General, Mr. Abbott said that as far as the overheads were concerned he said that he would look into whether they could be accounted for in a different way. Nevertheless, most of the budget involved related to the L posts, as it had been decided that they were to be financed through the overheads. As far is the cost sharing was concerned he said that it might be true that some of WTO's partner institution might use funds from other donors. However, that was nothing the WTO should get involved in. From the WTO perspective, they were contributing to the costs of the WTO and it was therefore a plus for the WTO and the donors and cost-sharing was what Members always asked the Secretariat to do and the Secretariat therefore attempted to do so.","WTCOMTDM43.pdf","Director-General, Abbott, WTO, WTO, WTO, WTO, WTO, Members, Secretariat, Secretariat"
"4611",4611,"33","33.      He went on to say that his first comment with respect to the draft budget related to cost sharing. It was good to have such an important contribution from other institutions as suggested. However, as far as the donors were concerned, it might be a case of double counting, as quite a few of the institutions which might contribute were institutions for which the funds were provided by the same donors. Although it was a reduced cost from a WTO point of view, it might not be a reduction of cost in terms of what single donors had provide. An example was that when some of the regional development banks carried out TA they did it with funds which were provided directly or indirectly provided by donors. In that respect it was important, at least for some of the donors, to get a transparent picture of any cost sharing. His second comment with respect to the draft budget was that of the calculation of overheads. Although it might be a mute point, he said that delegations were used to the overhead calculation of 13 per cent for consulting contracts with international institutions, as a global overhead to a single project. However, considering the WTO TA budget was different. He suggested that, instead of having an overhead of 13 per cent, it would be more helpful to get a real account for the overhead. A real account would show the actual cost for the institution, instead of using a system did not seem to be adapted to the actual budget methods of an institution like WTO.","WTCOMTDM43.pdf","WTO, WTO, WTO"
"4610",4610,"32","32.      The representative of Switzerland said that he preferred to separate the three topics relating to technical cooperation and first talk about the evaluation of the regional trade policy courses and the draft 2003 TA budget and wait with the more important which was the draft 2003 TA Plan. His delegation had found the evaluation the regional trade policy courses to be a good and interesting document because the Committee's decisions in the future would have to be based on evaluations of present activities. In that connection he said that his delegation had hoped to have at least a preliminary evaluation of the implementation of the 2002 TA Plan for the preparation of the draft 2003 TA Plan. However, the evaluation of the regional trade policy courses in Africa did not contain much about the impact of the two seminars and, in that sense, left the question about the use of different TA tools open. He did not share the optimistic view that the evaluation was positive. What it did indicate was that better preparation was be necessary. More time to prepare was necessary. The funding had to be available before the final plans were made. The choice of partner institution was essential. The intervention by the representative of Morocco was a case in point. There seemed to be some relief in terms of the cost and even higher savings might be possible in the future by delegating more activities to the regions. As far as the future was concerned, he said that the evaluation had not, and could not yet answer the questions of whether more, the same number, or fewer regional trade policy courses were needed and over what time period. Neither did the evaluation contain information regarding the opportunity cost of regional trade policy courses and the relative use of those courses in comparison with other technical cooperation tools. He said that his personal conclusion was that the trend should be to increase the number of regional trade policy courses and decrease the number of workshops and short-term activities. In addition, it was important for delegations to get a clear idea from the Secretariat of the resource implications of the regional trade policy courses and how the human resource problems were going to be solved. What had also become clear from the evaluation of the regional trade policy courses was that the choice of partner institution was essential. There was a suggestion in the report that the choice should be made through and open bidding process. It was important that a decision on a transparent process of selecting partner institutions was made, open to scrutiny by Members. Cooperation with local training institutes should be of long term as the transfer of capacity to the trainers in the region was a gradual process until the WTO could somewhat disengage.

"4609",4609,"31","31.      As concerned the imperfections of the Course held in Casablanca, he went on to say that his delegation regretted that the course had not functioned as well as foreseen, at least not in the logistical and administrative respects. Morocco was a major organizer of international events. The success of the Marrakech Ministerial Conference illustrated that. His delegation had been somewhat shocked and saddened to learn about the content of the evaluation report. It had been necessary to look back with a realistic and objective perspective. His delegation had then realized that the responsibility that the Government of Morocco had for the Casablanca Course was one that was shared with the WTO Secretariat. It was shared in the sense that the preparation of the course, the negotiation of the modalities, and the discussions regarding certain arrangements had not followed the normal procedures for the quite simple reason that they had not been managed by the appropriate WTO structures. The Technical Cooperation Division and the Training Institute had not been directly involved in the organization of the Casablanca course. It was a shared responsibility, not necessarily by the appropriate WTO structures but by certain individuals who had managed the Casablanca Course as a personal affair. In the context of the regrettable deficiencies on the part of the ISCAE it had to be recalled that that institute had not been officially selected by his Government. The choice of institute had rather been made on the first floor of the WTO Secretariat. Equally, the MOU had also been drawn up on the first floor of the WTO Secretariat. The problems encountered were, in that sense, foreseeable. His Mission had not been involved in the preparations in order to avoid problems. The involvement of certain Government departments could have avoided the currency exchange problem unfortunately experienced by some participants. However, what was important was to draw lessons from had happened. Nevertheless, his delegation did not believe that the Government of Morocco alone should bare the entire responsibility for the mistakes made in the organization of the Casablanca Course. His delegation had therefore been surprised to notice that the Nairobi course was confirmed for 2003, but that the venue had been left open for French speaking Africa according to page 36 of document WT/COMTD/W/104/Add.1/Rev.1. He asked on which basis the Casablanca                                                                                      WT/COMTD/M/43                                                                                             Page 11 Course had been withdrawn. His delegation had been pleased to hear that Mr. Rolian had mentioned that that the Casablanca Course had met its main objectives. The Government of Morocco was capable of organizing the next course with a firm commitment that the errors of the past would not be repeated in the future, and in the hope that the WTO Secretariat would not repeat the errors it had committed either. His Authorities committed itself to discuss the basic criteria directly with the Heads of the Technical Cooperation Division and the Training Institute in order to agree on the best possible modalities which would ensure the success and continuation of the regional trade policy course for French-speaking Africa in Morocco. However, the Moroccan institution to be selected in full cooperation and coordination with the different ministries in Morocco might be in Rabat and not in Casablanca. He therefore launched an appeal to the WTO Secretariat as well as to his fellow French-speaking African delegations in order to ensure that the regional trade policy course for French-speaking Africa could continue and that the regional basis would be consolidated with Morocco as a basis. However, lessons should be drawn from previous mistakes and efforts should be made in order for this regional trade policy course, in which his Government firmly believed, to become successful. His Government had, even before the launching of last year's regional trade policy course, officially contacted the Technical Cooperation Division in order to organize a third cycle course at the Mohammed V University in Rabat. It was for all those reasons that his Government, if the course were to be confirmed, would not spare any effort to comply with the commitments made by the different departments involved in order to ensure the best possible conditions for the successful implementation of the course.","WTCOMTDM43.pdf","Casablanca, Morocco, Marrakech, Ministerial, Conference, Morocco, Casablanca, Course, WTO, Secretariat, WTO, Technical, Cooperation, Division, Training, Institute, Casablanca, WTO, Casablanca, Course, WTO, Secretariat, MOU, WTO, Secretariat, Morocco, Nairobi, Africa, Rolian, Casablanca, Course, Morocco, WTO, Secretariat, Technical, Cooperation, Division, Training, Institute, Africa, Morocco, Morocco, Rabat, Casablanca, WTO, Secretariat, Africa, Morocco, Mohammed, V, University, Rabat"
"4608",4608,"30","30.     The representative of Morocco said that his statement related to the introduction given by Mr. Rolian relating to document WT/COMTD/W/107 which contained the evaluation of the African Trade Policy Courses held in Nairobi and Casablanca. Those courses had been organized with a short term outlook in the context of the post Doha TA/CB to meet the needs of the African continent. That goal had largely been achieved, in spite of the fact that the courses had been considered as a pilot project. In that context it was first important to draw lessons in a self-critical manner in order to allow for an objective analysis. His delegation noted the problems flagged in the report concerning the Trade Policy Course held in Casablanca. His delegation believed that the relatively short time available for the preparation of the course and the inexperience of the ""Institut Supérieur de Commerce et d'Administration des Enterprises (ISCAE)"" in organizing such courses certainly had contributed to the logistical and administrative problems which had been encountered. It was normal that practical implementation problems arose with a pilot project conceived and implemented in a short period of time. That was especially true when, as in the case of the two Africa courses, it was a question of almost complete delocalisation of a course traditionally held in Geneva.","WTCOMTDM43.pdf","Morocco, Rolian, Nairobi, Casablanca, Doha, Casablanca, Institut, Supérieur, de, Commerce, et, d'Administration, des, Enterprises, Africa, Geneva"

The CTD had considered it and taken note of it. He asked what action the delegation of the United States wished the CTD to take. 3.       All evaluations, including those carried out on site by TCA (about 12 a year) serve as input into the annual report which TCA submits to the Committee in the first part of the year (the report on the activities of 2001 was issued on 11 April 2002). This timing allows for consideration of the totality of activities that have taken place in the reference year. TCA will certainly make every effort to respond to the request that the evaluation of 2002 activities reaches Members by the end of March 2003. More frequent reporting of evaluations such as those carried out by TCA is not customary, nor is it likely to be meaningful in respect of the kind of activities carried out by the WTO (large in number and fragmented) , in the absence of a critical mass of information on which to base an analysis.","WTCOMTDM43.pdf","Chairman, RTA, India, Sri, Lanka, Committee, on, Trade, Development, CTD, United, States, CTD, TCA, TCA, Committee, TCA, Members, TCA, WTO"
"4606",4606,"29","29.      He went on to say that a couple of more elements had been added to the figure of CHF 21.5 million. The activities of the WTO Training Institute were not covered by the regular WTO budget and the small amount of CHF 233,000 therefore had to be added, as had overheads costs of an amount of CHF 2,8 million. The total cost for WTO TA and training then amounted to CHF 24,6 million. However, a number of resources already existed. CHF 1 million was available from the regular budget for TA work. The balance of the Global Trust Fund at the end of 2002 was expected to amount to between CHF 1 and 3 million. That depended on the Secretariat's success in delivering undelivered activities, on whether some of the Members would pay their pledges, and on pledges which had been announced either in March 2002 or more recently for 2003. Those resources amounted to between CHF 7,7 – 9,7 million to be deducted from the figure of CHF 24,6. Taken together, that meant that Members would be asked to pay between CHF 15 and 17 million. That was a substantially lower figure than the one presented at the last meeting. He further described the main elements of the reduction that made. One principal saving came from the fact that financing of capital-based officials participation in Geneva-based activities for the most part had been excluded. The Secretariat had hoped to enhance the participation of capital-based official in activities in Geneva as it was good for institution building. However, it had proved to be an expensive activity. The Secretariat would therefore not pursue it. A second element of the reduction of the total cost was that the Secretariat assumed cost-sharing with its partners such as the regional development banks and UN regional economic commissions. There was reason to believe that they would contribute as they had done so earlier. Some activities had been ""rationalized"" by being cut. For example, only three seminars for the training of trainers were included in the revised draft 2003 Plan instead of the WT/COMTD/M/43 Page 10 originally planned six. On the other hand, the positive evaluation of the first two regional courses in Africa had led the Secretariat to the conclusion that they should be repeated. The revised version of the 2003 TA Plan therefore contained two similar courses costing somewhat over 1 million CHF each. Finally, the Secretariat had decided that all the 19 L posts provided for TA delivery was going to be paid for from the Programme Support Fund. There had been a significant under-spending in 2002 because the Secretariat had not been able to recruit new staff immediately, and some had only began to work in 2002. That had meant that those posts could be financed out of the Programme Support Fund in 2002 and that the Secretariat would be able to do the same for 2003 as well. However, in a year's time Members would have to consider another solution because by then all the available money would have been used and an alternative way of funding would have to be found. The Secretariat would take account of any comments Members might have with respect to the activities in the draft 2003 Plan and any such changes would also be translated into a revised budget estimate which he would then report to the Budget Committee.","WTCOMTDM43.pdf","WTO, Training, Institute, WTO, WTO, Secretariat, Members, Members, Secretariat, Geneva, Secretariat, Secretariat, UN, Africa, Secretariat, Secretariat, Secretariat, Secretariat, Members, Secretariat, Members, Budget, Committee"
"4605",4605,"28","28.      Deputy Director-General, Mr. Abbott said that the estimated cost for the revised draft 2003 TA Plan was lower than that for the initial draft 2003 TA Plan. However, the volume of activities was broadly the same as in 2002. As indicated at the previous meeting, the results of the discussions in the CTD would be taken into consideration by the Committee on Budget, Finance and Administration (Budget Committee) later in 2002 when it was to make a recommendation to the General Council for the target amount for the DDA Global Trust Fund for 2003. The figures that he would present would be adjusted, as necessary, to reflect the results of Members' discussions and he would report back to the     Budget    Committee       accordingly.        Members      had    before     them     document WT/COMTD/W/104/Rev.1, its Addendum WT/COMTD/W/104/Add.1/Rev.1, and document WT/COMTD/W/103 relating to training. Members had also received document CRP(02)/4 which provided some of the basic figures he was to present. The activities had been grouped into three categories: the Geneva-based activities, the regional activities, and the national activities. Geneva- based activities were held at the WTO headquarters and could involve either Geneva-based delegates, as was most often the case or a mixture of Geneva-based and capital-based delegates, as well as some outside speakers. Regional activities were activities which involved several WTO Members or Observers and for which participants’ travelling and subsistence costs had to be financed. National activities were events for one Member for which the WTO financed the travel cost of WTO staff members to go and service such an event. The good news, compared to the figures he had presented at a previous meeting, was that the costing for all the draft 2003 TA Plan was approximately CHF 21.5 million. The total was in actual fact higher and estimated at CHF 28.5 million. However, the figure of CHF 28.5 million had been reduced by CHF 7 million because the Secretariat expected to be able to share costs in a number of cases with partners, so the net total for the technical cooperation activities was that CHF 21.5 million. The figure had been arrived at using standard methodologies, calculating a standard cost per person and day, multiplied by the number of days etc. The figures were therefore average figures.","WTCOMTDM43.pdf","Director-General, Abbott, CTD, Committee, on, Budget, ,, Finance, and, Administration, -LRB-, Budget, Committee, General, Council, DDA, Global, Trust, Fund, Members, Budget, Committee, Members, Members, Geneva, WTO, WTO, Members, Member, WTO, WTO, Secretariat"
"4604",4604,"27","27.      He further said that the paper highlighted a number of practical issues that arose, some of which were linked to the nature of the exercise itself, whatever the venue, and some of which were specific to the venues selected. That was incidentally a point to which attention was drawn, namely the need to select venues on the basis of a clear indication of commitment, a clear list of specifications, and to make a thorough analysis of the real potential of a candidate venue to host a course. In the present case, if more time had been available, that would have allowed more analysis, which in turn might have permitted identification of some of the problems that later emerged. He said that the report concluded by drawing attention to a number of issues that were likely to be central to any discussion on the future of such regional courses. Those include costs, but also the place of the courses in the overall portfolio of WTO TA/CB activities, the trade-offs that might have to be made,                                                                                    WT/COMTD/M/43                                                                                            Page 9 the implications for staff resources and resource allocation, and the number, frequency, and geographical spread of the programme. For its part, and bearing those conclusions in mind, the Secretariat had decided to propose the continuation of the courses in Africa as part of the draft 2003 TA Plan, as had already been stated.","WTCOMTDM43.pdf","WTO, Secretariat, Africa"
"4603",4603,"26","26.      He further said that, after the substance of the courses, another important issue on which the Members would no doubt wish to focus was the cost, in both absolute and relative terms. When the courses were launched, there had been some alarming estimates that the courses would cost far more than those held in Geneva. However, having been budgeted at over one million Swiss francs each, they had been brought in at less. The other piece of good news was that based on an analysis of the Nairobi experience (the Casablanca figures were in the process of being analysed but were not expected to produce very different results), it could be said that the courses were about as expensive, per participant and per day, as the courses in Geneva. However, there were elements that cause difficulty in the comparison, but the Technical Cooperation Audit had done its best to compare like with like. On that basis the regional courses come out with a slight cost advantage overall. Both the regional and the Geneva courses cost considerably less than many other TA/CB activities carried out by the WTO Secretariat. The third issue that had emerged as being particularly critical in the conduct of the courses were the implications for the Secretariat in terms of human resources, and more generally the circumstances surrounding the planning, design and execution of the courses. The courses were add-ons to an already heavy programme of work in the Training Institute, which had been assigned principal responsibility, as well as in operational divisions that provided resource persons. The time frame for getting the courses up and running was perilously tight, and as a result, there had been a good deal of precipitation. There had been no time to assess adequately the human resource implications, much less to do anything about them. Those implications must be taken into account, whatever unit was assigned responsibility, especially since the courses were run far away from the Geneva base, which inevitably engendered additional problems. The courses had a large budget (in this case over CHF 2 million). They were thus not negligible projects in financial terms, nor in terms of the inroads they made on the Secretariat’s capacity to deliver TA with the usual quality. Of course, over time, if those courses work out as we expect in relation to the third objective, local institutional capacity and ownership, then it could be expected that the input from the WTO Secretariat would be a diminishing one.","WTCOMTDM43.pdf","Members, Geneva, Nairobi, Geneva, Technical, Cooperation, Audit, Geneva, WTO, Secretariat, Secretariat, Training, Institute, Geneva, Secretariat, WTO, Secretariat"
"4602",4602,"25","25.      He went on to say that he would concentrate his remarks on the three main conclusions that could be drawn from the experience. First, and most importantly, the courses had done what they were set out to do. Fifty officials (27 in Casablanca and 23 in Nairobi) had been given the opportunity to attend a long trade policy course, which they would not have been able to do at all, or would have had to wait for as opportunities arose in Geneva. There was a clear regional focus, a focus that cannot delivered during the Geneva-based courses because the participants in the Geneva- based courses were from more than one region. The regional focus had been assured in two ways. First, the subjects covered had been illustrated by references to the regional context to the greatest extent possible. Second, regional resource persons had been associated in the delivery of the courses, albeit in different ways in Casablanca and Nairobi. In Nairobi the teaching assignments had been WT/COMTD/M/43 Page 8 most often shared between a WTO resource person and a regional resource person, whereas in Casablanca, there had been no shared teaching, but rather individual modules delivered by local experts. The first two objectives had therefore been entirely achieved. It was clear from the feedback that the participants had significantly enhanced their knowledge and skills, in the same way as they would have, had they been able to attend a Geneva-based trade policy course. The replication of the Geneva courses, which was the basic blueprint for the African courses, had worked. In addition, participants had been able to concentrate on questions on which they had shared concerns, or which were of particular relevance to them. The consolidation of those gains would of course depend, as for all TA activities, on the participants being and remaining in functions related to the Multilateral Trading System. As for the third objective, the creation of an institutional base in the region for taking over responsibility for the courses, a promising beginning had been made, particularly in Nairobi, but that was by definition an issue on which more experience would be needed before it was possible to say that the objective had been fully met. What could be said was that in Nairobi, the foundation for future regionally based capacity to run the courses and ownership of them had been laid through the shared teaching arrangements and a real training of trainers. That was not as evident from the experience in the French-speaking course.","WTCOMTDM43.pdf","Casablanca, Nairobi, Geneva, Geneva, Casablanca, Nairobi, Nairobi, WTO, Casablanca, Nairobi, Nairobi"
"4601",4601,"24","24.      Mr. Paul Rolian, Director, Technical Cooperation Audit, said that Members had before document WT/COMTD/W/107 containing the evaluation of the regional trade policy courses that had been held in Casablanca and Nairobi earlier in 2002, for French-speaking and English-speaking African countries, respectively. Despite the Secretariat's best efforts to get the report to Members quickly after the conclusion of the courses at the beginning of October 2002, it had come out relatively late in relation to the meeting of the CTD, in particular the translations into French and Spanish, and he asked for Members' indulgence on that point. In any case, the message of his report was a rather simple one. He said that, before getting into the subject of the paper, it was worth stressing that the report dealt exclusively with the African Trade Policy Courses. The general annual evaluation report on WTO’s TA activities would be prepared in the first part of 2003, in accordance with the Secretariat's commitment to Members.                  The report contained in document WT/COMTD/W/107 was not a feasibility study on future Regional Trade Policy Courses either. That was a matter on which Members would have to pronounce, in the light of experience with the first two courses. Nevertheless, there were elements in this report that Members might wish to take into account. The starting point for the evaluation, like any evaluations, was the objectives which the courses had been intended to achieve. The efficiency, effectiveness, relevance and sustainability of the courses were examined, and some conclusions and lessons learned were drawn from the experience. The objectives were framed in the context of the undertakings in the Doha Development Agenda, and bearing in mind the need to provide supplementary capacity-building activities for developing and LDCs in the build-up to the Fifth Ministerial meeting, that was to go beyond “business as usual”. There were three objectives for the courses. First, they constituted a means of increasing the number of government officials who could benefit from the long trade policy courses that had traditionally been run in Geneva. Second, they were intended to give a distinct regional focus to the standard Trade Policy Course mode. Third, and perhaps the most ambitious objective, was that the courses were to initiate a process of institutional capacity-building in the African region through partnership arrangements with academic institutions and regional resource persons to whom, over time, ownership of and responsibility for the capacity building instrument would be transferred.","WTCOMTDM43.pdf","Paul, Rolian, Director, Technical, Cooperation, Audit, Members, Casablanca, Nairobi, Secretariat, Members, CTD, Members, WTO, Secretariat, Members, Members, Members, Doha, Development, Agenda, LDCs, Geneva"
"4600",4600,"23","23.     Finally. questions had been asked regarding the delivery of TA under the pressure of the Fifth Ministerial Conference. Mr. Osakwe responded that the Secretariat would distribute work and time the activities as efficiently as possible. However, if the adoption of the 2003 TA Plan was further delayed, the situation would become more complicated. He said that he would not comment on the issues raised with respect to quality and effectiveness as Mr. Paul Rolian, Dierctor of the Technical Cooperation Audit would respond.","WTCOMTDM43.pdf","Osakwe, Secretariat, Paul, Rolian, Dierctor, Technical, Cooperation, Audit"
"4599",4599,"22","22.     Mr. Osakwe responded to questions that had been posed on trade clinics. The Secretariat was in the process of preparing an internal Secretariat note which would provide guidelines for the application of trade clinics. When that had been done and had been approved by the senior management, Members would be informed. An illustrative example of how Trade Clinics would aply was evident in the case of Sierra Leone. The Trade Minister of Sierra Leone had written to the WTO                                                                                    WT/COMTD/M/43                                                                                            Page 7 Director-General to inform him that Sierra Leone had just emerged from a destructive civil war and that no trade policy infrastructure was in place. Sierra Leone was a non-resident, least-developed country and wanted the WTO to assist it in the formulation of trade policy, provide a WTO reference centre and assist its integration into the multilateral trading system. The Government of Sierra Leone had not been in a position to respond to the WTO letter regarding its TA needs. WTO senior management was of the view that Sierra Leone was a perfect case for a trade clinic.","WTCOMTDM43.pdf","Osakwe, Secretariat, Secretariat, Members, Sierra, Leone, Sierra, Leone, WTO, Director-General, Sierra, Leone, Sierra, Leone, WTO, WTO, Sierra, Leone, WTO, WTO, Sierra, Leone"
"4598",4598,"21","21.     The Secretariat had also been asked to clarify how it assessed TA needs. Mr. Osakwe said that needs were primarily assessed through the TA requests from the beneficiary countries. However, they were also assessed through the Trade Policy Reviews, the back-to-office reports written by WTO professional staff, the diagnostic trade integration studies from the Integrated Framework, and the Geneva Weeks for non-resident missions. Another area which the Secretariat had been asked to clarify was its capacity to deliver TA. The Secretariat capacity to deliver TA had never really been measured. Proper counting of activities delivered in a year was begun in 2002. Four hundred and four (404) activities had been delivered by the end of October 2002 even though the 19 L-positions had not been activated until the summer of 2002. He said that he estimated that by the end of 2002 about 450 activities would have been delivered. Using 2002 as a base-year, and not withstanding the pressure of the Ministerial Conference in 2003, he estimated the Secretariat executing capacity to be between 400 and 450 activities per year.","WTCOMTDM43.pdf","Secretariat, Osakwe, Trade, Policy, Reviews, WTO, Integrated, Framework, Secretariat, Secretariat, Secretariat"
"4597",4597,"20","20.      Mr. Osakwe further said that a number of revisions had been requested by the delegation of Zambia, on behalf of the LDCs, at the 8 October 2002 meeting. Those editorial revisions had been incorporated. Members had also asked for clarifications and explanations in several areas. First, the clarification of the overall structure and strategic partnerships had already been provided. There had also been questions regarding negotiation-focused activities. The Secretariat had been able to develop several software tools, principally thanks to the Department for International Development of the United Kingdom which had provided additional resources. The Secretariat had organized a meeting on 18 October 2002 to which UNCTAD and the OECD had been invited to present their programmes and tools to enhance trade negotiations skills. The WTO Secretariat had also developed tools and would be organizing more trade negotiation skills seminars. Trade negotiations were also a key part of the activities of the WTO Training Institute. These trade negotiation skill activities would be organized in cooperation with ITC, UNCTAD, OECD and the World Bank since those agencies had also developed complementary tools. Eight regional training courses for senior government officials on the Doha Development Agenda would be organized. The Secretariat had been asked about its outsourcing initiatives. Some activities had been outsourced to the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) based on a cooperation agreement. The WTO Secretariat was in the process of dialogue with the International Development Law Institute (IDLI), which was an intergovernmental agency with solid experience in the area of training-of-trainers. The Secretariat was further exploring outsourcing possibilities and would be reporting accordingly. The Secretariat applied strict criteria when outsourcing. First, outsourcing was sought for cost-efficiency reasons. Second, the WTO would only outsource to organizations which did not engage in advocacy as the WTO Secretariat had been mandated by Members to maintain the full integrity of their collective positions.","WTCOMTDM43.pdf","Osakwe, Zambia, Members, Secretariat, Department, for, International, Development, United, Kingdom, Secretariat, UNCTAD, OECD, WTO, Secretariat, WTO, Training, Institute, ITC, OECD, World, Bank, Doha, Development, Agenda, Secretariat, World, Intellectual, Property, Organization, WIPO, WTO, Secretariat, International, Development, Law, Institute, Secretariat, Secretariat, WTO, WTO, Secretariat, Members"

The representative of the United States said that her delegation wished to add, under ""Other Business"" an item relating to reporting on the Regional Trade Agreement (RTA) between India and WT/COMTD/M/43 Page 2 Sri Lanka. She said that her delegation wished that that Agreement also be reported to the Committee on Regional Trade Agreements (CRTA). 2.       A new Addendum would 2 be created, entitled ""Outreach activities"". The remaining activities (the first seven listed on Page 28) would be moved to that new Addendum 2. That new Addendum would have the following three footnotes:         (a)    There would be a footnote relating only to the Trade and Environment Symposium,                (the first activity in the new Addendum 2 on ""Outreach Activities"") stating that: ""The                Secretariat will consult with the Committee on Trade and Environment and the                Committee on Trade and Development on modalities, agenda, and participation in                respect of this symposium"".         (b)    The second footnote would relate to the following six regional activities (the six                regional activities in Addendum 2). That footnote would state that: ""The Secretariat                will consult with the members and the organizations involved and the CTD                Chairperson on these activities"".         (c)    That there would be a third footnote relating to the entire Addendum 2 stating that:                ""Within the context of a full review of technical assistance and capacity building, a                decision will be taken on the inclusion of such regional activities in technical                assistance and capacity building for subsequent years."" 2.      The latter issue falls into the competence of TCA. Members will recall that since the beginning of 2002 a new system of evaluation of TA activities has been in place (it was adopted at the end of March 2002). Because of the great number of activities to be evaluated, heavy reliance has been placed on a system of combining internal evaluations by TCA with self evaluation by TA providers in order to ensure maximum coverage of TA activities. This arrangement provides for a comprehensive coverage of all WTO TA activities. Both types of evaluation rely heavily on feedback from the beneficiaries. Based on the analysis of these evaluations, Techncial Cooperation Audit (TCA) can provide immediate feedback to the resource persons/secretariat division(s) concerned.","WTCOMTDM43.pdf","United, States, RTA, India, Sri, Lanka, Committee, CRTA, Secretariat, Committee, on, Trade, and, Environment, Committee, on, Trade, and, Development, Secretariat, CTD, Chairperson, TCA, Members, TCA, WTO, Techncial, Cooperation, Audit, TCA"
"4595",4595,"19","19.      Mr. Osakwe explained the revisions that had been made to the draft 2003 TA Plan, contained in documents WT/COMTD/W/104/Rev.1 and Add.1/Rev.1. The first revision related to strategic partnerships between the WTO and other agencies. Members had been keen on a strategic partnership between the WTO and UNCTAD. That partnership already existed. The WTO Director-General had convened a meeting with UNCTAD Secretary-General Mr. Ricupero and ITC Executive Director Mr. Bélisle on 30 October 2002 at which they had recommitted themselves to that partnership. This Partnership had been reflected in paragraph 46 (b) of document WT/COMTD/W/104/Rev.1. Paragraph 46(a) of that same revision referred to the strategic partnership with the agencies involved in the Integrated Framework. The WTO Director-General would be chairing the Third Meeting of the Integrated Framework Heads of Agencies that Mr. Koehler, IMF Managing Director, had agreed to host.      The regional trade policy courses held in Africa had been included in WT/COMTD/W/104/Add.1/Rev.1. These Regional Trade Policy Courses was a key part of the revision which had been made possible by the positive evaluation of those courses by Mr. Paul Rolian, Technical Cooperation Audit. There was a focus on the least-developed countries in the draft 2003 TA Plan. At the last meeting of the Sub-Committee on Least-Developed Countries, the representative of Zambia, on behalf of the LDCs, had made an encouraging statement saying that the draft 2003 TA Plan was in the right direction. The LDCs' Consultative Group had also made a number of suggestions that the Secretariat would be able to take into account when implementing the 2003 TA Plan. There had been a request for the inclusion of a special module on special and differential treatment (S&D) in the WTO training activities. Such a module had been included and WT/COMTD/M/43 Page 6 would figure in all WTO training activities. He further said that it was necessary to deal with the large amount of ad-hoc activities. The ad-hoc activities had decreased from constituting almost 100 per cent of WTO activities when the 3-Year Plans were in place (and there were no real plans) to 29 per cent in 2002. WTO senior management had supported that ad-hoc activities should not exceed 5 per cent of planned activities in 2003. However, there was still some flexibility as beneficiary countries could always substitute activities. Substituted activities would not be considered as an ad- hoc activity. Criteria for ad-hoc activities had been approved by the senior management and were included in paragraph 17 of document WT/COMTD/W/104/Rev.1. The Secretariat would thus be in a position to take account of unforeseen negotiation dynamics. Ad-hoc activities might also arise in the application of trade clinics but would still not exceed 5 per cent of planned activities in 2003. In addition to the revisions mentioned, he said that there were several editorial revisions to the draft 2003 TA Plan.","WTCOMTDM43.pdf","Osakwe, WTO, Members, WTO, UNCTAD, WTO, Director-General, UNCTAD, Ricupero, ITC, Director, Bélisle, Integrated, Framework, WTO, Director-General, Integrated, Framework, Heads, of, Agencies, Koehler, IMF, Director, Africa, Paul, Rolian, Technical, Cooperation, Audit, Zambia, LDCs, LDCs, ', Consultative, Group, Secretariat, WTO, WTO, WTO, WTO, Secretariat"

However, only six weeks remained in 2002 and according to internal Secretariat procedures, nine weeks were needed to prepare for every activity. That meant that the Secretariat again would start late with the delivery of the coming year's activities. The slippage would not only affect the distribution of activities over the year, in light of the fact that a WTO Ministerial Conference would be held in 2003, but also the implementation rate for 2003.","WTCOMTDM43.pdf","Secretariat, Secretariat, Secretariat, WTO"

At the request of some delegations, the item was kept on the agenda for the October 2002 meeting of the CTD at which the Committee had taken note of the notification. The Secretariat had, at that meeting, also clarified the procedures for notifying RTAs under the Enabling Clause. His Government had fulfilled its legal requirements by jointly notifying the RTA to the CTD. There was no obligation to notify a RTA under the Enabling Clause to any other WTO body. The delegation of the United States had referred to the issue of transparency. His delegation was of the view that it had fulfilled the requirements by notifying the full provisions of the RTA to all Members, through the CTD. A copy of the RTA between India and Sri Lanka was circulated to all Members. In relation to the transparency issue, his delegation wished to reiterate its request to the delegation of the United States, first made at the May 2001 meeting of the CTD and reiterated in July 2002, to provide details of the African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA) besides Annexures.

"4589",4589,"17","17.     Mr. Osakwe provided the reasons for the cancellation of 22 activities. First, the recipient countries had cancelled activities for a variety of reasons. Despite repeated attempts by the Secretariat to contact some of the recipients, the Secretariat had not been able to secure a feed-back that would enable the Secretariat to go ahead with the implementation of the activity. For example the absorptive capacity was limited in certain countries and the date, the time, the venue, and complementary national arrangements etc. had not been agreed. Second, some activities were carried out jointly with other agencies and were not under the exclusive control of the WTO. Joint or coordinated delivery between the WTO and other organizations sometimes complicated the delivery when the other organization was not ready to implement the activity. Yet in other cases, there had been cancellations because there had not been enough progress in related areas to justify delivery. For                                                                                        WT/COMTD/M/43                                                                                                Page 5 instance, in the area of accessions it had not be feasible to carry out the activity if the working party had not met or if the consultations by the Chairman of a Working Party had not been fruitful. For some activities, and particularly for the enhancement of trade negotiations skills, the WTO Secretariat had to wait for tools to be developed before it could deliver. Most of the activities related to trade negotiations skills would be delivered in the last two months of 2002. In addition, certain activities had not been delivered when there was risk to life and security of Secretariat staff and participants. This was so particularly under unstable domestic conditions. He further said that the Secretariat needed the help of the Membership in order to reduce the number of ad-hoc activities. There was an opportunity cost in that if the Secretariat carried out more ad-hoc activities it had to reduce the delivery of planned activities and vice versa. The Secretariat capacity to deliver in terms of number of staff had only been boosted late in the year. The Secretariat had assumed that he would have had the 19 L-posts on 1 January 2002. That had not been the case because of a variety of reasons including late remittances of pledged contributions. The result was that by the end of October 2002, 98 planned activities had not been delivered. The Secretariat was confident that it would be able to deliver 60 per cent of those outstanding activities before the end of the year. The outstanding 40 per cent would be dealt with by including some of them in the planned activities for 2003. In some cases, the roll-over had been requested by Members when activities had been scheduled during the holy Ramadan period. Further, some planned activities had been replaced by ad-hoc activities. The advantages of having annual TA plans were that such plans were flexible and could easily be changed to enhance quality. Annual Plans were also easer to evaluate and the volume of activities could be controlled. Five hundred and fourteen (514) activities had been planned for 2002. This mistake would not be repeated in the planning for 2003 when only 443 activities had been planned, but with an increase in value and efficiency. Figures would be adjusted as implementation evolved.","WTCOMTDM43.pdf","Osakwe, Secretariat, Secretariat, Secretariat, WTO, WTO, Chairman, Working, Party, WTO, Secretariat, Secretariat, Secretariat, Secretariat, Secretariat, Secretariat, Secretariat, Members"

In connection with the discussion of how the CTD handled notifications and its relationship to the process in the CRTA, she said that her delegation believed that agreements notified to the CTD under the Enabling Clause provided an important opportunity to improve transparency by referring them to the CRTA for review. While the issue was not on the regular agenda for the 43rd Session of the CTD, her delegation requested the Committee to consider adding such an item to the agenda for the following meeting of the CTD to consider positive steps that the CTD could take to improve notifications of RTAs and their referral to the CRTA for review.

The first suggested change related to the last sentence of paragraph 14 on page four, in which the date of the creation of the Special Session of the CTD should be corrected to read: ""..on 1 February 2002"". Second, there were two suggestions for deletions in the first sentence of paragraph 24 on page 6. The first suggestion was to delete the two words ""and environmental"" and the second to also delete the words ""at its 40th Session"" at the end of the phrase as there seemed to be unnecessary repetition. The first sentence of paragraph 24 would thus read ""At its 40th Session, the Committee began its consideration of paragraph 51 of the Doha Ministerial Declaration on identifying and debating developmental aspects of the negotiations, in order to help achieve the objective of having sustainable development appropriately reflected. He added that, having taken action on the 2003 Plan, that fact had to be included in the CTD Annual Report.

The Chairman said that what was paramount was not only to approve the draft 2003 TA Plan in its present form, with the changes outlined, but also to indicate that in the future, and sometimes early in 2003, there was a need to consider the issue WTO TA: how it is formulated, what its governing principles were, and the full range of issues related to it. That would not be done with a desire to micro-manage it, but to provide broad guidelines in order to ensure that it meets the needs and demands of the members. He suggested that the Committee take note of the statements made and accept the draft 2003 Plan with the suggested changes.","WTCOMTDM43.pdf","Chairman, WTO, Committee"

"4578",4578,"16","16.      Mr. Osakwe reported on the implementation of the 2002 TA Plan. Members would recall that they had authorized 514 activities on 6 March 2002. However, the rate of implementation was calculated based on 383 activities. The reason for that was that nine activities were not activities to be delivered to Members per se. They were activities authorized to developed tools in the area of trade negotiations and other areas. Another 122 activities had been cancelled. The reasons for cancellation would be provided.        One hundred and twenty-nine (129) planned regional activities had been implemented which constituted 75 per cent of the planned regional activities. One hundred and fifty-six (156) planned national activities had been implemented which constituted 74 per cent of the planned national activities. Then there were the unplanned ad-hoc activities. One hundred and nineteen (119) such activities had been carried out. The situation with ad hoc activities was undesirable, but it had to be put into perspective. The Secretariat had made suggestions in the revised TA plan of what had to be done to improve the situation. By the end of October 2002, a total of 404 activities had been implemented, combining 285 planned activities with 199 unplanned activities.","WTCOMTDM43.pdf","Osakwe, Members, Members, Secretariat, TA"

That activity should therefore be included in the draft 2003 TA Plan. However, should it not be possible to organize such an activity in the course of 2003, he wished that it be considered for the near future.","WTCOMTDM43.pdf","Paraguay, Caribbean, Canada, Caribbean"

"4567",4567,"15","15.     He repeated that WTO TA frequently was judged exclusively by the Annual TA Plans. This was not the totality of WTO TA. There were several key components to a WTO TA plan. One key part was the Joint Integrated Technical Assistance Programme to Selected Least-Developed and Other African Countries (JITAP). The JITAP, which principally was directed towards eight African countries, was in its second phase. There had been requests for the extension of the JITAP and a review of it had been undertaken. He said that the Common Trust Fund – Steering Group (CTF-SG) and the Management Committee had been pleased with the results of the review regarding the implementation of the JITAP as well as the recommendations that had been made for its extension. A possible extension of JITAP to an additional eight African countries was under consideration. The JITAP was a key part of the Secretariat's strategic partnerships with other organisations. He said that another key component to the WTO TA plan was the Integrated Framework (IF) for LDCs. The IF Working Group had been extended from the six-agencies involved to also now include two LDCs' representatives, two donor community representatives as well as the representative of the WT/COMTD/M/43 Page 4 Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD).                      On 3 May 2002, an ""Understanding"" had been reached between the WTO and the regional development banks (RDBs). Cooperation with the RDBs was another component of the WTO Technical Assistance Plan. He expected the Secretariat to shortly be in a position to report on the results of a meeting that had been held with the RDBs on 30 October 2002. At that meeting, an eight point understanding had been reached that would not only help build on the synergies that had been created between the WTO and those RDBs, but which also would enable the WTO achieve significant cost savings to the benefit of the donors. Another component of the WTO TA Plan was the cooperation between the WTO and the Regional Economic Commissions. A meeting had been held with the Regional Economic Commissions at which an agreement had been reached. The Secretariat would shortly report on that and circulate the eight point understanding reached. With respect to the several Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) between the WTO and various organizations, he said that he wished to mention that an MOU was under negotiation with the ACP. On 9 September 2002, the Director-General Dr. Supachai had met with the Mr. Goulongana, the Secretary General of the ACP and both had committed themselves to a Cooperation MOU between the WTO and the ACP. The Secretariat were in the process of working out the details of that MOU. Discussions were also under way with regard to a possible MOU with the World Customs Organisation (WCO) either. This was work in progress. There was thus a large number of MOUs in the making, even if all of them had not yet been put on paper. The Secretariat would shortly be reporting on progress in that respect, as part of the architecture of WTO Technical Cooperation. Finally, managing the never ending requests and match them with the supply was what the Secretariat continuously attempted to do. A joint WTO/OECD database was under development to address several of these issues, including estimating progress that is being made in the implementation of the Doha technical cooperation and capacity building commitments. The database had been finalized and would be available as of 28 November 2002. There would be a report on that Database to the December 2002 meeting of the WTO General Council under the same item as the Director-General would be reporting on his mandate under Paragraph 41 of the Doha Ministerial Declaration. Members should thus judge the implementation of WTO's technical assistance and capacity building (TA/CB) mandate and the adequacy of the implementation on the entire TA architecture.","WTCOMTDM43.pdf","WTO, WTO, WTO, Joint, Integrated, Technical, Assistance, Programme, Management, Committee, JITAP, Secretariat, WTO, IF, Working, Group, LDCs, Organisation, for, Economic, Cooperation, and, Development, OECD, WTO, WTO, Secretariat, WTO, WTO, WTO, WTO, Regional, Economic, Commissions, Secretariat, MOU, WTO, MOU, ACP, Director-General, Supachai, Goulongana, ACP, MOU, WTO, ACP, Secretariat, MOU, MOU, World, Customs, Organisation, WCO, Secretariat, WTO, Technical, Cooperation, Secretariat, Doha, WTO, General, Council, Director-General, Members, WTO"

Furthermore, based on the evaluation of the 2002 Plan in the CTD, and the performance of the initial phase of the 2003 Plan, Members might wish to review the remaining portion of the 2003 Plan. That would be once the evaluation of the implementation of the 2002 Plan was available and Members had a rough idea of the performance of the initial phase of the 2003 Plan. I believed that, with those changes, Members should be in a position to take action on the Plan. I therefore asked if the Committee could authorize the Secretariat to proceed to implement the 2003 TA Plan as presented in documents WT/COMTD/W/104/Rev.1 and WT/COMTD/W/104/Add.1/Rev.1, with the suggested changes and the commitments from the Secretariat, while the Committee would keep its implementation under review. He also asked if the Committee could agree to refer the 2003 TA Plan to the Budget Committee, with those changes for the Budget Committee to make a recommendation to the General Council on a target amount for the Doha Development Agenda Global Trust Fund in 2003.","WTCOMTDM43.pdf","CTD, Members, Members, Members, Committee, Secretariat, Secretariat, Committee, Committee, Budget, Committee, Budget, Committee, General, Council, Doha, Development, Agenda, Global, Trust, Fund"
"4565",4565,"148","148.     That was the solution which emerged from the consultations on the section on ""Outreach activities"". Some concerns had also been expressed with respect to paragraphs 37 and 38 in Section X                                                                                  WT/COMTD/M/43                                                                                         Page 41 (A) on page 16 of document WT/COMTD/W/104/Rev.1. The suggestion emerging from the consultations was to delete the last sentence in paragraph 37 which began by: ""The NEPAD is designed…"". Secondly, it was proposed that the wording of the second sentence in paragraph 38 be changed to read: ""However, the WTO is exploring ways of cooperating with the NEPAD in the future."" Delegations might recall that the delegation of Kenya and others had had some concerns and that proposed wording was intended to take care of those concerns. It did not stop the WTO from cooperating with the NEPAD in the future. That would be explored. Finally, it was proposed that when the Committee take action on the 2003 TA Plan, ""The Secretariat committed itself to:         -       provide detailed information on activities carried out in 2002 before the end of                 February 2003,         -       provide a full evaluation of the activities carried out in 2002, by March 2003,         -       produce quarterly reports on activities during 2003,         -       produce a structured plan on how to increase outsourcing to other multilateral                 institutions,         -       review, together with Members, the underlying terms of reference of the Global Trust                 Fund, including issues of access to the Fund and its management,         -       circulate an information note on the Trade Clinics and further consult with Members                 on their modalities, and         -       accommodate the suggestion for small island countries in the Pacific to be considered                 as countries from a region constituting a special challenge.","WTCOMTDM43.pdf","WTO, Kenya, WTO, Committee, Secretariat, Members, Members, Pacific"

He asked the representative of India what he meant by ""another window"". His delegation believed the 2003 TA Plan could be renamed ""Technical Assistance and Capacity Building Plan"" and some changes might be made in order to classify the symposium as capacity building. His delegation still believed that negotiators did benefit from that type of activity by being confronted by some of the views of NGOs which from his experience could be forceful. However, Members currently needed to consider the technicalities of the situation.","WTCOMTDM43.pdf","European, Communities, Secretariat, India, Members"
"4558",4558,"141","141.     The representative of India said that the representative of the European Communities was correct in saying that the difficulties could not easily be dealt with. Nevertheless, his delegation did not consider the trade and environment symposium to be a TA activity that would benefit negotiators and could not accept it as part of the 2003 TA Plan. He said that the point made by the representative of Norway that the process was meant to be demand-driven was useful. He did not see how the trade and environment symposium could be regarded as a demand-driven activity or how it would increase the capacity of negotiators. He reiterated that if that activity were to be financed form another ""window"", then his delegation would support it.","WTCOMTDM43.pdf","India, Norway"
"4557",4557,"140","140.     The representative of the European Communities said that he preferred the first language but that the basic questions could not be dealt with that easily. His delegation felt that the outreach activities, including the one on sustainable development, responded to demands that had been made in the past, particularly the financing for delegates and NGOs from developing countries to attend that type of activity and that it was justified. His delegation respected the view of those who felt that those activities should not be part of the TA Plan but that meant that the draft 2003 TA Plan would not be adopted at that meeting. His delegation could otherwise mention a number of activities that it did not feel were necessary. The 2003 TA Plan was a package and the symposium should, as a principle, be part of that package. His delegation was willing to address some of the concerns expressed such as consultations with the Government of the country in which the activity would be held and consultations on the participants of the symposium. It was the attempt to exclude those activities from the TA Plan that his delegation could not agree with.","WTCOMTDM43.pdf","European, Communities"
"4556",4556,"14","14.     Mr. Osakwe, Director, Technical Cooperation Division, said that his seven point presentation would deal with the structure of WTO technical cooperation. The structure of WTO technical cooperation was important because the WTO was frequently judged exclusively on the basis of its Annual TA plans. However, he believed that WTO Technical Cooperation needed to be judged in terms of its entire architecture. Members had requested a detailed report on the implementation of the 2002 TA Plan. The Secretariat would be able to give precise feedback with regard to the regional, national and ad hoc activities. He said that the Secretariat had experienced an inability to deliver some activities and that certain activities had been cancelled by the beneficiaries. He would provide further information regarding the reasons why some planned activities had not materialized. In addition, he would provide information on what the Secretariat would do and how it would respond to the balance of undelivered activities in the 2002 TA Plan. He would then make a connection between the 2002 and 2003 TA Plan and through the substantive revisions introduced to the 2003 TA Plan. He would also provide further clarifications regarding some other areas with respect to which Members had requested more detailed information.","WTCOMTDM43.pdf","Osakwe, Director, Technical, Cooperation, Division, WTO, WTO, WTO, WTO, Technical, Cooperation, Members, Secretariat, Secretariat, Secretariat, Members"

The representative of Norway said that it was important to have the element of demand- driven activities in the TA plan and that it was not for the CTD to question individual Members' requests for assistance. It was also important not to micro-manage the activities. It was a difficult question for her delegation as it felt strongly about the issue of the environment while it had some sympathy for the view expressed by the Indian delegation of whether the symposium could be considered as TA for negotiations.

It would be necessary, at a later stage, to fine tune the modalities of the symposium. The suggestion of leaving the issue open after the agreement that had been reached in 1999 meant that the issue would be up for discussion again. If some of the activities were going to be removed from the Plan then his delegation would need more time to think about how to resolve the issue.

The representative of China said that there seemed to be two divergent points of view and suggested putting a footnote that read ""to be decided through further consultations"" to the environment symposium without removing it from the list. How Members would consult would not be referred to because some members felt that the matter should be put before the CTE and others felt that consultations should be carried out by the Director-General. He said that it would be a shame to postpone the adoption of the 2003 TA Plan to a further date.","WTCOMTDM43.pdf","China, Members, CTE, Director-General"

The representative of Lesotho said that it would be unfortunate to delay the adoption of the 2003 TA Plan until the CTD had met in February 2003 or even later as Members were not certain that the contentious issues would be resolved in February given the difficulties in the CTE. Legitimate concerns that had been expressed, particularly by the representative of China, with respect to the NGOs that would benefit from the symposium. The response to that was that Members would get a chance to consider the list of invitees for that seminar. That would give Members the opportunity to ensure that the participants did have a genuine interest in the discussions on environment and sustainable development. It would be unfortunate to delay the adoption of the 2003 TA Plan to February 2003 or even later. His delegation hoped to maximised the benefits from the 2003 TA Plan by holding as many of the activities as possible that his delegation had requested before the Fifth Ministerial Meeting. He urged those Members who had expressed difficulties with the draft 2003 TA Plan to consider allowing the adoption of the Plan on the understanding that Members would have a final say on the participants of the symposium to ensure the necessary focus it was intended to have.","WTCOMTDM43.pdf","Lesotho, CTD, Members, CTE, China, Members, Members, Members, Members"

The representative of Mexico reiterated that his delegation was concerned about setting a precedent indicating that the CTD would need the approval of the other specific committees.

His delegation would not have any problem accepting its inclusion in the 2003 TA Plan once the CTE had taken decision on it. The fact that in 1999 it had to be put to the Director General for a resolution indicated that it was a highly contentious issue. The Committee was considering how to build negotiating capacity in developing country Members and did not see how a symposium for NGOs would contribute to that purpose.","WTCOMTDM43.pdf","India, Chairman, CTE, CTE, Director, Committee, Members"

The representative of the European Communities said that even the inclusion of an asterix stating that a decision would be made at a later time actually meant that the trade and environment symposium would be taken out of the Plan which he did not feel was appropriate. What could be done would be to state that the question of the symposium was left open and handed over to the Director-General for further consultation in the General Council. If a decision was to be made at that meeting then it had to be one that included that activity in the 2003 TA Plan. He did not have the mandate to agree that individual items were taken out of the draft 2003 TA Plan.

The representative of the European Communities said that it seemed that the problem of the symposium went beyond both the CTE and CTD and Members had benefited from a decision being taken Director-General in 1999. If Members could not agree then they would have to turn to the Director-General. His delegation would deplore that as it would mean a delay in the delivery of 2003 TA. The question was not whether the symposium would be held or not but rather whether it would be financed under a separate financing mechanism. However, he said that it was impossible for his delegation to refer every WTO activity to its financial authorities. His delegation had therefore been pleased when the decision to stop separate funds had been made in 2001. He did not understand why the delegation of India had to revert to unravel a delicate agreement that Members had reached in 2001.","WTCOMTDM43.pdf","European, Communities, CTE, CTD, Members, Director-General, Members, Director-General, WTO, India, Members"

The representative of Canada said that she had attended the last trade and environment symposium and recalled that the list of invited NGOs had been circulated to delegations so that any NGO to which Members objected could be removed. That symposium had just as much to do with development as with environment. The symposium suggested was actually a trade and ""sustainable development"" symposium which included a wide range of discussions on development issues and if any WTO body should review the issue it should be the CTD.

The representative of the European Communities said that he had to apologize to the representative of India who was correct in saying that his delegation had raised concerns about financing the outreach activities from the TA budget at a previous meeting of the CTD. However, he said that there were many issues in the draft 2003 TA Plan which his delegation had been concerned about, but which it had been able to overcome and that he therefore hoped that the delegation of India would be able to overcome its reservations as well so that Members could move forward. With respect to the proposal to put the trade and environment symposium before the CTE for consideration, he said that although that could be done it was risky to leave that decision to the CTE because the CTE had difficulty taking any decisions given how difficult the issues were regarded. Members needed to avoid reconsideration of issues on which discussions had already been held and from which conclusions had been drawn.","WTCOMTDM43.pdf","European, Communities, India, CTD, India, Members, CTE, CTE, CTE, Members"

"4519",4519,"106","106.    Mr. Osakwe, Director, Technical Cooperation Division said that, with respect to the two regional workshops which were to be held in India, the first one which was a regional workshop for Asian Parliamentarians was being organised in collaboration with the Commonwealth Secretariat and that the WTO Secretariat would get the information on the contact point for India from the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association who was involved in the organization of the activity and would transmit it to the delegation of India in Geneva. For the second workshop on the ""Doha Development Agenda Issues at Stake for Asian Civil Society"" for which India was the venue he said that he had attempted to get that information from the Secretariat person dealing with that issue but that that person had not been available. However, he said that that information would be made available to the delegation of India on that same day. He said that the question that had been raised by the representative of Mexico was pertinent to Members' consideration on the trade and environment symposium. The WTO Ambassador of Egypt, supported by the delegation of Brazil, had in 1999 proposed that the Secretariat organise a high level symposium on trade and development prior to the Seattle Ministerial Conference. In the discussion that took place in the General Council a group of members had recommended a complimentary high level symposium on trade and environment. The terms of both those symposia had been discussed in the General Council and the conclusion had been that the General Council would give the Director-General complete discretion, within certain guidelines, to organise those two high level symposia. That was the origin of the trade and environment symposia that had been held since 1999. It would be unusual for the CTD to restart discussions on what had been concluded in 1999 by the Membership.","WTCOMTDM43.pdf","Osakwe, Director, Technical, Cooperation, Division, India, Commonwealth, Secretariat, WTO, Secretariat, India, Commonwealth, Parliamentary, Association, India, Geneva, India, Secretariat, India, Mexico, Members, WTO, Ambassador, Egypt, Brazil, Secretariat, Seattle, Ministerial, Conference, General, Council, General, Council, General, Council, Director-General, CTD"

The representative of India said that at the first meeting of the CTD held after the draft 2003 TA Plan in October, (WT/COMTD/W/104/Add.1) his delegation had expressed its reservations with respect to the outreach activities. It was therefore not correct to say that his delegation was expressing its reservations at the last minute. In addition, the Secretariat had still not provided information on the contact point in India as his delegation had requested. It was therefore impossible for his delegation to check with the people concerned. He suggested that, if the donor community were interested in the outreach activities, that list could be removed from the TA Plan and put somewhere else, and that a different window be opened for financing such activities. However, he needed to check with his                                                                                    WT/COMTD/M/43                                                                                           Page 35 Government if it could accept the two documents (WT/COMTD/W/104/Rev.1                               and WT/COMTD/W/104/Add.1) and he needed information on the contact points in India.","WTCOMTDM43.pdf","India, CTD, Secretariat, India, India"

"4516",4516,"103","103.     The representative of the European Communities said that the next meeting of the CTE was scheduled to be held in February 2003 which did not help Members as they needed to adopt the 2003 TA Plan quickly. He said that over the past four years the question of the environment symposium had not been dealt with in the CTE but had been dealt with at the General Council level at the request of the Director-General. That had also happened in 1999 and would practice to follow. Members were called to approve a draft 2003 TA Plan, the content of which had been known to Members since 8 October 2002. His delegation had been working on the basis that as a donor, his delegation would be asked to accept the draft 2003 TA Plan in total and to make money available for the activities in the Plan. It would cause problems to his delegation if two if a number of activities were taken out only days before the adoption of the Plan, because his delegation had considered the possibilities of funding the draft 2003 TA Plan on its entire content. His delegation could not agree to a plan from which a number of activities which were important to some of his delegation's constituencies were taken out at the last minute. That could be compared with the fact that the Committee would not agree to the removal, at the last minute, of some SPS and TBT activities which were important to other delegations. His delegation could therefore not accept a compromise where part of the national activities were moved elsewhere and all the regional workshops were removed. His delegation was willing to ensure that the issues were presented in a way that made sense and accept that they were not labelled as TA. If a delegation wished to question an activity scheduled to be held in its country, as the delegations of India and Costa Rica had indicated, his delegation agreed that they could be given time to consult their capitals. The activity would only be carried out if the capital agreed. It would otherwise be cancelled. He believed that the 2003 TA Plan needed to be adopted in its entirety. If Members could not agree on the issue of the trade and environment symposium, then Members would have to request the Director-General to follow past practice and it would probably end just as the symposium was proposed in the revised plan. However, if Members could not agree on that then the CTD would have to report that due to reservations on a number of activities the 2003 TA Plan could not be adopted at that meeting.","WTCOMTDM43.pdf","European, Communities, CTE, Members, CTE, General, Council, Director-General, Members, Members, Committee, SPS, TBT, India, Costa, Rica, Members, Members, Director-General, Members, CTD"

Although it might be interesting to hear the views of the CTE on the trade and environment symposium he was concerned with the underlying systemic consequences if the CTD would have to consult with other committees before taking a decision.

As indicated by the Airgram, he proposed that that Session be devoted to technical cooperation and training and the draft Annual Report. He said that it had been difficult to circulate the draft annual report in advance of the meeting because the Sub-Committee on Least-Developed Countries (LDCs) had held its final meeting of the year on 7 November 2002.

He said that Members would have an opportunity to comment on the draft Annual Report at the end of that day's meeting. He further said that for those who wished to study it further, comments could also be given to the Secretariat during the course of the week but had to be given on the afternoon of 14 November 2002 at the latest.

In connection with its consideration of the proposed Coordinated WTO Secretariat Annual TA Plan for 2003, several delegations commented on the importance they attach to the monitoring and evaluation of WTO TA activities. Two types of feedback appear to be desired by Members:         (a)     periodic reports on implementation of the agreed plan, including financial                 implications; this is a matter which should be taken up by the Technical Cooperation                 Division in the framework of its established procedures for reporting on the progress                 made in the implementation of the TA Plan;         (b)     qualitative evaluation of the activities, i.e. evaluation of performance.

"4498",4498,"99","99.     The representative of the United States said that her delegation wished to address two points. The first related to the overall Article XVIII review and the second specifically to Section C of Article XVIII. Her delegation had reviewed recent information and records of the CTD discussions over the past year. Her delegation was still not persuaded that a current review was warranted. No compelling arguments or new information had been presented to change that view. Her delegation WT/COMTD/M/42 Page 38 was still prepared to listen to any new ideas and to reflect on them. Much time had been spent on implementation issues of the last few years, including tiret 3. She recalled substantial consideration as part of the Uruguay Round of negotiations as well. That might be an area where there was no consensus to move forward. With regard to Article XVIII:C her delegation continued to believe that it should only be used after recourse to all other WTO mechanisms had been exhausted. Members currently had recourse to the Agreement on Safeguards and Countervailing Duties and the understanding of balance-of-payments. Those provisions had served the needs of the international community well. At the Doha Ministerial Conference, Members had agreed to a rules discussion. However, no consensus had been reached to open negotiations on Article XVIII. She asked Members what had changed.","WTCOMTDM42.pdf","United, States, CTD, Uruguay, WTO, Members, Doha, Ministerial, Conference, Members, Members"
"4497",4497,"98","98.      She further said that developing countries were finding it increasingly difficult to have recourse to the provisions under Article XVIII on account of the almost punitive provisions of compensation which would actually nullify the impact of the development measures taken by them for raising the general standards of living. The ability of a Member, in the process of development of its economy, to offer additional concessions or face suspension of concessions of other measures being taken by the Member to promote industrial development was limited. Thus, where Members were satisfied that all reasonable efforts had been made to consult, by the member seeking to invoke the provisions of Article XVIII, then for the purposes of paragraphs 7.(b) and 18.(b) of Article XVIII, as the case might be, shall be sufficient for WTO Members, acting jointly, to concur in the proposed measure without the member having to offer additional concessions or having to face temporary suspension of concessions. It might be recalled that her delegation had initially made that proposal in document WT/GC/W/363 of 12 October 1999. In addition to making a determination that the economic benefits accruing to the member using Article XVIII far outweighed the adverse impact on global trade of that measure it was important to establish that there was a significant negative impact on the exports of another Member. Suspension of equivalent concessions or demands for additional compensation did otherwise not appear to be justified. Her delegation also felt that there was a need to amend Article XVIII:C, particularly paragraph 13 by adding the words ""development of a particular industry"" to the already existing objective of Section C of ""establishment of a particular industry"". Further, her delegation had earlier indicated that the procedures under paragraphs 14 to 21 of Article XVIII also required reconsideration. Under the present system, the member resorting to Section C of Article XVIII had first to seek the concurrence of the contracting parties which shall, inter alia, consult as to the purpose of the proposed measures, alternative measures available under other provisions, effect of the proposed measure on the economic and commercial interest of other contracting parties. Even after all that had been done, any other contracting party substantially effected could take action to withdraw equivalent concessions. As indicated by her delegation, that would defeat the objective of seeking to initiate the proposed measures. Her delegation therefore urged Members to consider those suggestions in order to further clarify and improve the elements which were currently hampering the effective use of Article XVIII by developing country members.","WTCOMTDM42.pdf","Member, Member, Members, WTO, Members, Member, Members"
"4496",4496,"97","97.       The representative of India said that Ministers at the Doha Ministerial Conference had given a clear mandate for a complete review of Article XVIII with a view to ensure that it served the original objective of facilitating the progressive development of economies in developing countries and to allow them to implement the programmes and policies of economic development designed to raise the general standard of living of their people. Article XVIII was not a new issue. It had been on the agenda since before the Seattle Ministerial Conference. Her delegation had been flagging the issue of a review of Article XVIII as her delegation believed that Article XVIII was the most important S&D provisions, the implementation of which should serve the basic objective of development. Her delegation had also explained at considerable length the rational behind seeking a review of Article XVIII. There was a need to clarify the procedural ambiguities which prevented its effective utilisation. The Secretariat papers noted that Article XVIII had been replaced twice. Once in 1948 and the second time in 1957. The objective underlying the last change was to represent and accord a new and more positive approach to the problem of economic development and to the ways and means of reconciling the requirements of economic development with obligations undertaken under the GATT regarding the conduct of commercial policy. Considering the obligations that Members had on account of a changed and increasingly competitive trading environment and the balance that needed to be struck with developmental imperatives, there was a need to re-examine and reassess Article XVIII so as to make it more user friendly and geared towards integrating developing countries faster into the multilateral trading system.","WTCOMTDM42.pdf","India, Doha, Ministerial, Conference, Seattle, Ministerial, Conference, Secretariat, GATT, Members"
"4495",4495,"96","96.      The Chairman said that the comments made by the representative of Sri Lanka reflected the fact that the philosophy of trade and its relationship with development had been evolving over time. He went on to say that, at the informal meeting in September, the delegation of India had made reference to its submission in document WT/GC/W/363 of 12 October 1999. The delegation of India had also suggested an in-depth analysis of each provision of Article XVIII to identify the elements preventing developing countries from making use of those provisions and that contributions from Members, including experience from Members that had invoked the provisions, would be useful in that respect.                                                                                    WT/COMTD/M/42                                                                                           Page 37","WTCOMTDM42.pdf","Chairman, Sri, Lanka, India, India, Members, Members"
"4494",4494,"95","95.      The representative of Sri Lanka said that his delegation was grateful for the information provided. He said that information regarding the practical experience of the use of Article XVIII:C had to be provided by Members. The Government of Sri Lanka had used Article XVIII:C in a particular situation at a particular time as the economic circumstances and the trade policies being followed at that time were quite different from the current situation of the country. His country had faced balance-of-payments difficulties in the 1940's and 1950's and there had been other economic development constraints. A different trade policy regime had therefore been followed in the 1940's and 1950's. For example, an import licences schemes had been restricting foreign exchange allocations. It was against that background that the Government of Sri Lanka had invoked Article XVIII at that time. From 1977 onwards, as the trade policy context had changed,, the Government of Sri Lanka had followed a more liberal economic policy under which import licence requirements and exchange rate controls had been abolished.","WTCOMTDM42.pdf","Sri, Lanka, Members, Sri, Lanka, Sri, Lanka, Sri, Lanka"
"4493",4493,"94","94.     Mr. Low, Director, Development and Economic Research Division, said that the Secretariat had attempted to search for information with respect to the invocation of the Government of Sri Lanka of Article XVIII. It seemed that Article XVIII had been invoked eight times by the Government of Sri Lanka. The Secretariat had compiled the documents with respect to the invocations by the Government of Sri Lanka, referred to in the footnotes of the Secretariat documents WT/COMTD/W/39 and its Addendum 1, and provided those to the delegation of Sri Lanka. The Secretariat was diffident about attempting to make judgements about what difficulties were associated with the invocations. The Secretariat could compile the documents referred to into some kind of working document if that was helpful. However, he did not believe that the Secretariat was in a position to carry out an analysis of difficulties encountered by Members in the process of invoking different WTO provisions. That would have to be left to the judgement of the Members concerned.","WTCOMTDM42.pdf","Low, Director, Development, and, Economic, Research, Division, Secretariat, Sri, Lanka, Sri, Lanka, Secretariat, Sri, Lanka, Secretariat, Sri, Lanka, Secretariat, Secretariat, Secretariat, Members, WTO, Members"
"4492",4492,"93","93.      The Chairman invited Members to move on to address Agenda Item H relating to GATT Article XVIII as one of the outstanding implementation issues. The Secretariat had been asked to produce background documents relating to how Article XVIII had been applied in the WTO and in the GATT. The result of the Secretariat's analysis was contained in documents WT/COMTD/39 and its Addendum 1 (WT/COMTD/39/Add.1). He said that he believed that the questions before the Committee were how it should deal with Article XVIII, excluding Section B, as an outstanding implementation issue, what delegations wished to get out of the consideration of it, and what the goal of the reporting in December should be. At the informal meeting in September, the delegation of Sri Lanka had noted that the Secretariat documents had indicated that Sri Lanka had invoked Article XVIII in the past. However, the records in the Mission of Sri Lanka did not indicate what difficulties the delegation had faced in invoking the Article. The delegation, therefore, asked the Secretariat for information on traces in WTO records of any difficulties the Government of Sri Lanka might have encountered in invoking Article XVIII.","WTCOMTDM42.pdf","Chairman, Members, GATT, Secretariat, WTO, GATT, Secretariat, Committee, Sri, Lanka, Secretariat, Sri, Lanka, Sri, Lanka, Secretariat, WTO, Sri, Lanka"
"4491",4491,"92","92.     The Committee decided to revert to the item at its next meeting. WT/COMTD/M/42 Page 36","WTCOMTDM42.pdf","Committee"
"4490",4490,"91","91.       The Chairman said that the Committee had decided to keep an item relating to Paragraph 51 of the Doha Ministerial Declaration as a standing item on the agenda. Paragraph 51 related to the identifying and debating developmental and environmental aspects of the negotiations in order to help achieve the objective of having sustainable development appropriately reflected. The issue of sustainable development had also been the subject of the informal consultations held on 10 September 2002, shortly after the Johannesburg World Summit on Sustainable Development (WSSD). At the informal consultation, it had been agreed that, at the CTD Meeting, the Committee might also consider the negotiated documents that emerged from the WSSD. The documents had been circulated in multi-symbol document WT/COMTD/W/106 - WT/CTE/W/220, as the CTE also wished to consider them. He hoped that delegations had been able to consider the contents. One of the issues that the Committee might wish to consider was how the outcome of the WSSD should be treated in the context of the WTO in general, and the CTD in particular. He urged delegations to address both the substantive elements of Paragraph 51 as well as the developmental aspects of the outcome of the WSSD, and to indicate how views that had been expressed in the latter might fit into the work of the CTD. He said that he believed that Members would welcome any new suggestion that delegations might wish to offer. As there were no requests for the floor, the Chairman said that it seemed clear that delegations still required time to consider all aspects of the topic.","WTCOMTDM42.pdf","Chairman, Committee, Johannesburg, Committee, CTE, Committee, WTO, CTD, CTD, Members, Chairman"
"4489",4489,"90","90.     It was so agreed.","WTCOMTDM42.pdf",""
"4488",4488,"9","9.      The Chairman went on to say that there were four sub-items under agenda item C. Dr. Supachai would offer overall introductory comments on the subject of WTO Technical Assistance. Thereafter, the Director of Technical Cooperation, Mr. Osakwe, would inform the CTD of the process of drawing up the 2003 Technical Assistance (TA) Plan, explain the main features of the requests received and, briefly highlight key details of the Plan. DDG Mr. Abbott, would then make a statement on the financial implications of the 2003 TA Plan. Sub-items (i), (ii) and (iii) of the agenda item would thus be covered together and sub-items (iv) and (v) relating to training would be covered after the conclusion of the discussions on the 2003 TA Plan.","WTCOMTDM42.pdf","Chairman, Supachai, WTO, Technical, Assistance, Director, Osakwe, CTD, Abbott"
"4487",4487,"89","89.     The Chairman said that he believed that the suggestion made by the representative of the United States to work with other processes within the WTO and to benefit from possible synergies was an excellent one. He suggested that the Committee take note of that suggestion and attempted to do something about it.","WTCOMTDM42.pdf","Chairman, United, States, WTO, Committee"
"4486",4486,"88","88.     The representative of Paraguay said that his delegation had not had enough time to study the Addendum in detail. However, he realized that it related to a disaggregation of the data that had been provided in the earlier document. His delegation would comments on the paper at the next meeting of the Committee.","WTCOMTDM42.pdf","Paraguay, Committee"
"4485",4485,"87","87.      The representative of the United States said that her delegation believed that the Addendum provided more detailed information on a country-by-country basis. She noted that the well researched report mainly focussed on trade trends which her delegation believed to be an important piece of the picture. However, her delegation wondered whether it would be possible to look into some of the other factors that assisted Members to increase their participation in trade, such as considering the trade-policy review mechanism and extract indicators which would assist Members to get a broader sense of the participation of developing countries in world trade. She was not aware of how much work that would involve. Nevertheless, to look at trends meant to only consider one part of the picture. A broader focus would be of benefit to the Committee.","WTCOMTDM42.pdf","United, States, Members, Members, Committee"
"4484",4484,"86","86.      The Chairman said that agenda item F related to the participation of developing countries in world trade. The CTD had the mandate to keep under continuous review the participation of developing country Members in the multilateral trading system. In order to assist the Committee to fulfill that part of its Mandate, the Secretariat had produced a paper contained in document WT/COMTD/W/100. The item had been kept on the agenda as some delegations had expressed the wish to have more time to study the paper. A request had also been made at the last meeting for the                                                                                        WT/COMTD/M/42                                                                                               Page 35 Secretariat to provide country-specific information of the aggregated regional analysis presented in the paper. Addendum 1 to the document (WT/COMTD/W/100/Add.1.) aimed to respond to that request.","WTCOMTDM42.pdf","Chairman, CTD, Members, Committee, Secretariat, Secretariat"

"4482",4482,"84","84.      The representative of Japan said that his delegation appreciated the interest shown by other delegations in his Government's GSP scheme. At the last meeting, his delegation had not been able to provide comprehensive responses to all questions made. Document WT/COMTD/N/2/Add.11 containing the notification by the Government of Japan consisted of a couple of parts. One related to LDC beneficiaries and the other to ceiling quotas for industrial products. His delegation had understood the questions posed at the last meeting to relate to how the Government of Japan would manage the ceiling quotas for industrial products and to the relation between those quotas and the GSP scheme for the LDCs. The answer was that the industrial products to which the Government of Japan applied the ceiling quotas would not be affected by its GSP scheme for LDCs. As earlier explained, the GSP scheme for LDCs already included tariff and quota-free treatment for 99 per cent of the imports into Japan of industrial products from LDCs. The GSP scheme for LDCs was a separate scheme which did not affect the ceiling quotas for industrial products. With respect to the management of the ceiling quotas for industrial products, he said that the Government of Japan granted preferential tariffs on 81 industrial product groups. The ceilings in the GSP scheme related to the total value or quantity of each product group and was provided at the beginning of each fiscal year. The fiscal year in Japan began on 1 April. The most-favoured nation rate of duty would apply after the ceilings had been exceeded. The preferential treatment would also be suspended for a particular product group with reference to a particular preference receiving country if preferential imports originating in that country exceeded a maximum amount of 20 percent of the total value or quantity of the ceiling. The Government of Japan determined the amount of imports from a particular country based on the customs statistics in Japan. There might therefore be some differences between the reality and the statistics once the statistics were finalized. However, the Government of Japan attempted to apply the maximum 20 per cent country amount as far as possible since it would allow more countries to enjoy the preferences.","WTCOMTDM42.pdf","Japan, GSP, Japan, Japan, GSP, Japan, LDCs, GSP, LDCs, Japan, GSP, LDCs, Japan, GSP, Japan, Japan, Japan, Japan"
"4481",4481,"83","83.      The Chairman said that, at the last meeting, the delegation of Japan had introduced a notification contained in document WT/COMTD/N/2/Add.11. The delegation of Switzerland had also introduced a notification contained in document WT/COMTD/N/7/Add.1. At that meeting, some delegations had posed questions that required detailed answers. It had therefore been decided that the two items be kept on the agenda. To the extent that the two notifications related to measures in favour of LDCs, they had been forwarded to the Sub-Committee on LDCs for substantive consideration and reporting back, according to the reporting procedures agreed to at the 32nd Session of the CTD. However, it had been pointed out at the last meeting that the overall Generalized System of Preferences (GSP) Scheme to which the notifications referred was for the CTD to consider, so the notifications did not exclusively apply to the LDCs.","WTCOMTDM42.pdf","Chairman, Japan, Switzerland, CTD, GSP, CTD"
"4480",4480,"82","82.     The Committee took note of the notification and clarification provided by the Secretariat. WT/COMTD/M/42 Page 34","WTCOMTDM42.pdf","Committee, Secretariat"
"4479",4479,"81","81.      Mr. Low, Director, Development and Economic Research Division, said that the situation, as far as the Secretariat understood, was that any regional trade agreement (RTA) had to be notified to the WTO. Depending on the legal cover sought, Article XVIII, GATS Article V, or the Enabling Clause, the notifications would be sent to the Council for Trade in Goods, the Council for Trade in Services or the CTD. A notification would never be sent directly to the CRTA. The decision to refer the notification to the CRTA remained with the body which had received the notification, and it was up to them to set the terms of any examination by the CRTA. The CRTA in practice only examined what had been referred to it. There was thus no legal requirement to notify the CRTA as such. What had happened in practice was that the process of referring agreements notified under Article XXIV to the CRTA for examination had become more or less automatic, it was a growing practice in the case of RTAs notified under Article V of the GATS, but it was rare for notifications of RTAs under the Enabling Clause to be referred to the CRTA. In fact, the MERCOSUR Agreement was the only one that had been referred to the CRTA.","WTCOMTDM42.pdf","Low, Director, Development, and, Economic, Research, Division, Secretariat, RTA, WTO, Council, for, Trade, in, Goods, Council, for, Trade, in, Services, CTD, CRTA, CRTA, CRTA, CRTA, CRTA, CRTA, CRTA, CRTA"
"4478",4478,"80","80.      The Chairman said that item D related to notifications under the Enabling Clause. At the last meeting of the CTD, some delegations had requested more time to consider the notifications regarding the Free Trade Agreement between India and Sri Lanka contained in document WT/COMTD/N/16. It was, therefore, agreed that the item be kept on the agenda. There had also been a request for a clarification of the notification procedures regarding free trade agreements. More specifically, information had been sought as to whether such notifications under the ""Enabling Clause"" also required notification in the Committee on Regional Trade Agreements (CRTA). He therefore asked the Secretariat to clarify the notification procedures.","WTCOMTDM42.pdf","Chairman, CTD, India, Sri, Lanka, Committee, CRTA, Secretariat"
"4477",4477,"8","8.       The Chairman welcomed Director-General Dr. Supachai to the meeting. He said that in his statements to the General Council, and in other fora including at the High Level Segment Meeting of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) Trade and Development Board, the Director-General had emphasized that technical assistance and capacity building was one of the four priority areas of his administration. His presence in the CTD meeting was an illustration of the importance that he attached to technical assistance within the framework of the WTO. The Chairman also welcomed Deputy Director-General (DDG) Dr. Rana to whom the Director-General had assigned the responsibility for the broad horizontal theme of developing more effective and targeted WTO technical assistance and capacity building. In addition, he welcomed DDG, Mr. Abbott whom, within his thematic responsibility of strengthening the WTO as a Secretariat and as an institution, was responsible for budgetary matters.","WTCOMTDM42.pdf","Chairman, Director-General, Supachai, General, Council, United, Nations, Conference, on, Trade, and, Development, UNCTAD, Trade, and, Development, Board, Director-General, CTD, WTO, Chairman, Director-General, Rana, Director-General, WTO, Abbott, WTO, Secretariat"

The representative of Barbados reiterated her delegation's interest in some of the field-based activities such as the training of trainers programmes, the cooperation with academic communities and institutions which was being carried out through the Training Institute. Her delegation found it interesting that the Training Institute had initiated many new activities. Her delegation looked forward to further development of some of the other initiatives such as the distance learning, video conferencing, and Internet-based courses. She said that the pilot projects for regional trade policy courses that had been held in Casablanca and Nairobi were important exercises, not only because of their capacity building aspects but also because of their linkage to the training of trainers and cooperation with the academic institutions. Her delegation looked forward to considering those further.","WTCOMTDM42.pdf","Barbados, Training, Institute, Training, Institute, Casablanca, Nairobi"

The Chairman said that it was the Technical Cooperation Division's documents relating to the 2003 TA Plan that would be subject to modifications based on the discussions that had taken place and not the proposals that had been made in document WT/COMTD/W/103 and WT/COMTD/W/105. However, the point made by the representative of Kenya that the two documents had to be consistent was important and would be taken into account.","WTCOMTDM42.pdf","Chairman, Technical, Cooperation, Division, Kenya"
"4473",4473,"76","76.     The representative of Kenya asked whether adopting the documents would affect the African Group's proposal with respect to the Nairobi and Casablanca trade policy courses. The Chairman had said that there would be changes to the documents. He said that he therefore assumed that the changes would relate to all the documents so as to retain the equilibrium. If the changes related to just one document, then his delegation would need to study all the documents before accepting them. He asked how much it would cost to turn the three-day, one-week and three-week courses into compact                                                                                    WT/COMTD/M/42                                                                                           Page 33 three-month courses. Some donors had questioned the budget so it was important to consider the most effective way of delivering the courses.","WTCOMTDM42.pdf","Kenya, African, Group, Nairobi, Casablanca, Chairman"
"4472",4472,"75","75.     Mr. Mercier, Director, Training Institute said that the Secretariat was aiming to have a final evaluation of the Nairobi and Casablanca courses by the end of October. The two courses had just been completed. Reports were being received from the resource people that had been used from both within and outside the Secretariat. The Secretariat was awaiting reports from the two institutions with WT/COMTD/M/42 Page 32 which the Secretariat had the partnership agreement. The assessments the Secretariat had received from the participants were in the process of being reviewed. It was an inter-divisional exercise which was being conducted under Mr. Rolian's Audit Unit. The Director-General would provide observations in due course. In response to the second question posed by the representative of Canada, he said that the Secretariat, in the annex to the document WT/COMTD/W/103, had attempted to identify where the funding was available, where there was no need for additional funds and where traditional activities of the Training Institute were normally financed by the regular budget. He said that the 5th Specialized Course on Dispute Settlement shown in row 5 on page 4, was provided for in the costing estimate that had been provided by DDG Abbott. That type of course was traditionally financed by other sources such as Trust Fund type of money, though it existed long before the Trust Fund came into being. Such courses were mandated by the Dispute Settlement Understanding (DSU) and did not constitute ad hoc requests. They were addressed to all Members of the WTO, not just to the developing countries. In each of those courses the participation of up to 10 participants from LDCs was financed. The Secretariat did not fund the participation of other developing or developed country participants. The induction days did not involve any costs as they were one-day activities. The trade policy courses were part of the institutional mandate dating back to 1956. The only caveat would be the courses that would be held in 2003. Due to the Conference 'ITU Telecom World 2003', the Secretariat would not be able to deliver more than one course, if it could even carry out one. That was due to the fact that there would be no rooms available in or around Geneva during the duration of that Conference. Even the traditional lodgers could not be used for the participants because they could charge up to five times the price of a room charged to the WTO. If the Secretariat could not arrange even one course, it would attempt to reallocate the money usually allocated for the three- month trade policy courses to the 2-3 week specialised courses carried out under the same mandate. Those might deal with specialised topics or they could be trade negotiation skills seminars. He said that what he had mentioned about the 5th Specialized Course on Dispute Settlement also applied for those courses. Since the decision of the Committee on BFA in 2001, the two three-week courses for LDCs (one in French and one in English) that used to be financed out of Trust Fund money had become part of the regular budget due to the trade-off in the Budget 2002 exercise between symposia and those courses in terms of financing from the Trust Fund. Where financing was lacking was for the training of trainers programme. That was a separate programme having been put forward in the 2003 TA Plan. The first phase of that programme in 2002 was financed from the Trust Fund. He said that that activity had been put under the regular budget requests for 2003. If the Committee on BFA turned it down then it would have to be considered under the Trust Fund. The distance learning was a continuation of the programme that was agreed in 2001 and the money had already been partly accounted for in the 2002 formulation of the budget over two years. That left the university networking activity for which no funding was available in addition to the constrained human resources. It was hard to develop a network with universities especially when they all wished to set up training institutes or required the WTO to provide other resources, including human resources. In 2002 alone the Secretariat had received several requests for such activities but had not received any funds. The Secretariat had therefore proposed a modest programme in the regular budget for 2003 in the hope that something could be developed, time and resources permitting. The Secretariat had been asked to carry out 16 courses with the same amount of staff because only a few new posts had been provided in 2001 and the recruitment of new staff had not been finalised. He encouraged Members to consider that programme as a best endeavour approach. If the resources were made available, then the Secretariat would do its best to deliver, the programme would otherwise have to be curtailed. He concluded by saying that the budget of the Training Institute was being discussed in detail in the Committee on BFA.","WTCOMTDM42.pdf","Mercier, Director, Training, Institute, Secretariat, Nairobi, Secretariat, Secretariat, Secretariat, Secretariat, Rolian, Director-General, Canada, Secretariat, Training, Institute, DDG, Abbott, Members, WTO, Secretariat, ITU, Secretariat, Geneva, WTO, Secretariat, Committee, BFA, Trust, Fund, Trust, Fund, Committee, BFA, Trust, Fund, WTO, Secretariat, Secretariat, Secretariat, Members, Secretariat, Training, Institute, Committee, BFA"

They related in particular to the courses in Nairobi and Casablanca that were currently under evaluation. She said that many delegations had stated how important those courses had been for the training of their country officials and she asked when the evaluation would be completed. She also asked which elements of that training programme were securely funded. That was a question that also arose with respect to the budget that had been presented earlier which seemed to include elements that were traditionally funded out of the regular budget. In addition, her delegation wondered which activities were to be funded from the Trust Fund and which were to be funded from the regular budget.","WTCOMTDM42.pdf","Canada, Nairobi, Casablanca"

He also proposed that documents of that sort be made available to Members well in advance of the meeting at which they would be considered.","WTCOMTDM42.pdf","Senegal, Members, Members"
"4468",4468,"71","71.      The Chairman said that the two remaining sub-items under agenda item C related to the training activities of the WTO. The Secretariat had prepared two notes, one containing an overview of the training activities of the WTO Secretariat contained in document WT/COMTD/W/105 and one on the planned activities of the WTO Training Institute in 2003 contained in document WT/COMTD/W/103. Those two notes were self-explanatory so unless there was a request for it, he would not ask the Secretariat to make any general introduction to them. He said that the Directors of the two divisions concerned, Mr. Chiedu Osakwe of the Technical Cooperation Division and Mr. Claude Mercier, Director of the Training Institute, were willing to respond to any queries Members might have or listen to any comments Members might wish to make.","WTCOMTDM42.pdf","Chairman, WTO, Secretariat, WTO, Secretariat, WTO, Training, Institute, Secretariat, Chiedu, Osakwe, Technical, Cooperation, Division, Claude, Mercier, Director, Training, Institute, Members, Members"

"4465",4465,"69","69.    The Chairman said that the 2003 TA Plan submitted by the Technical Cooperation Division was in many ways unique. It had been drafted well before its commencement date of January 2003.

Its early circulation gave Members time to review it. He said that, keeping in mind that Members had not had sufficient time to study the 2003 TA Plan and that several changes had been proposed, he suggested that the Secretariat should revise the 2003 TA Plan according to the comments made. The Committee would meet again to consider it. He noted that several delegations had asked for an account of the performance of the 2002 TA Plan and he believed that a brief performance report could be provided. He proposed that Members meet again on Monday, 11 November at 3 p.m. to discuss the 2003 TA Plan. A suggestion had been made for the CTD and the Committee on BFA to meet jointly and that was something that would be taken up with the Committee on BFA. There were some technical problems in having a joint meeting. He said that he was aware that the Committee on BFA would be meeting on 11 and 12 November but he was not aware what the agenda contained and whether they would be willing to discuss the 2003 TA Plan. An Airgram inviting Members to a meeting on 11 November would be circulated.","WTCOMTDM42.pdf","Chairman, Members, Members, Secretariat, Committee, Members, CTD, Committee, BFA, Committee, BFA, Committee, BFA, Members"

Her delegation welcomed the initiatives that had been taken by the Director-General and the innovative new activities that had been highlighted by the staff of the Technical Cooperation Division. Her delegation hoped for enhanced cooperation between the WTO and regional institutions in the African region. She also hoped that supply side constraints would be addressed. There should be some flexibility in addressing ad hoc requests for technical assistance.","WTCOMTDM42.pdf","Zimbabwe, Kenya, African, Group, Director-General, WTO"
"4463",4463,"67","67.     The representative of Ecuador said that the 2003 TA Plan was an improvement over the 2002 TA Plan. He said that his delegation would appreciate if future agendas included the possibility of commenting on the 2003 TA Plan in light of the 2002 TA Plan. That would ensure consistency and efficiency. It would be beneficial if some flexibility was applied to the requests presented by Members.","WTCOMTDM42.pdf","Ecuador, Members"
"4462",4462,"66","66.     The representative of Oman said that, as a recently acceded country with extensive market access commitments, her delegation was surprised to find that it had only been granted two technical assistance activities for 2003. That would not assist her Government's efforts to implement the commitments that it had undertaken in its accession negotiations, especially as her Government had not been granted any transitional periods for implementing the WTO Agreements. Her delegation believed that the assistance given to recently acceded Members should be increased. Her Government would only be able to implement its commitments if the Secretariat increased the number of activities. She was aware that some Members were concerned with the cost of the 2003 Plan and might try to reduce it. However, that would also mean reducing Members' implementation efforts.","WTCOMTDM42.pdf","Oman, WTO, Members, Secretariat, Members, Members"
"4461",4461,"65","65.      The representative of Indonesia said that the Director-General had mentioned his commitment to make the 2003 TA Plan a success and to ensure that it would benefit the recipient countries, especially the developing and least-developed countries. Technical assistance was a core element of the WTO's work to develop the capacity of developing and least-developed countries to participate in the global market. That was one way of increasing the level playing field of developing and least-developed countries vis à vis their developed training partners. His Government was one of those that had received WTO technical assistance for capacity building. However, bearing in mind the broad scope of the WTO agreements, his delegation was of the view that the WTO technical assistance programmes should not be limited to only a few agreements. Due to the lack of capacity and a limited understanding of the costs and benefits of the current negotiations, it was difficult for developing country governments like his own to limit their requests for technical assistance. He was aware of the Secretariat's limited human resources to meet Members' requests for technical assistance. He highlighted the urgent need for increased collaboration between the WTO and other relevant international organisations and having bilateral donor countries working together with the Secretariat. Such collaboration would be important in light of the limited resources that the Secretariat possessed. It was his delegation's view that to increase the quality and effectiveness of the technical assistance plans, the Secretariat should evaluate the 2002 TA Plan and report to Members.","WTCOMTDM42.pdf","Indonesia, Director-General, WTO, WTO, WTO, WTO, Secretariat, Members, WTO, Secretariat, Secretariat, Secretariat, Members"
"4460",4460,"64","64.      The representative of Romania said that, as a developing country in Eastern Europe, her Government attached great importance to technical assistance as a tool for economic development through improved participation in the multilateral trading system. The draft 2003 TA Plan was an important step in the direction of making technical assistance more focused and tailored to the needs of different groups of Members. It appeared to be well structured and included the contribution of other institutions. Her delegation found the 2003 TA Plan to be in accordance with the Doha Ministerial Declaration. She was pleased that several technical assistance activities would benefit WT/COMTD/M/42 Page 30 officials from her country even if not all the activities her delegation had requested had been included. Several delegations had mentioned that the cost of the 2003 TA Plan was too high. She said that her delegation was of the view that no amount was too large when spent on that form of education if the overall budget so allowed. At the same time, she said that her delegation supported the idea of having an accurate account of the cost of each technical assistance project. When working with the Secretariat on technical assistance matters, her Government had supported the inclusion of a project proposal received from an academic institution in Romania for a network of regional WTO centres. She asked for more information on that proposal. Involving academia in all WTO matters was one of the best ways to ensure a stable country and region.","WTCOMTDM42.pdf","Romania, Eastern, Europe, Members, Secretariat, Romania, WTO, WTO"
"4459",4459,"63","63.       The representative of China said that her delegation was aware that the drawing up of the 2003 TA Plan had involved a lot of work and that it had been necessary to take many elements into consideration to complete the effort. She noted that the Plan had been improved by learning from experiences from the 2002 TA Plan and that the 2003 TA Plan therefore presented more practical and flexible TRTA in favour of developing countries. As a newly acceded Member, her Government had conducted a series of seminars, workshops and training courses to improve the public awareness of the WTO and its rules. Since there were numerous domestic demands in that regard, the technical assistance that had been delivered by the WTO had played an important role to contribute to institutional and legal capacity building in her Government. An aspect worth highlighting was the delivery mode of technical assistance. She agreed that it was the quality and not the quantity of TA that counted. Her delegation regarded the content of the technical assistance delivered to be the critical issue. Seminars which presented general ideas or broad WTO rules were normally ineffective since such knowledge was not easily put into practice in specific economic environments. Therefore, her delegation suggested that future technical assistance activities be more focused.","WTCOMTDM42.pdf","China, Member, WTO, WTO, WTO"
"4458",4458,"62","62.     The representative of Mexico said that following what had been said by the representative of Sri Lanka he wished to clarify that the comments that had been made by his delegation were intended for the Secretariat to review. While he believed that institutional capacity was most important there were clearly situations where human capacity building was necessary as well.","WTCOMTDM42.pdf","Mexico, Sri, Lanka, Secretariat"
"4457",4457,"61","61.      The representative of El Salvador said that she also spoke on behalf of the delegation of Guatemala. She said that it was comforting to find a 2003 TA Plan that aimed to meet the specific needs of all countries in order to strengthen their negotiating capacity. She understood that the work of compiling the requests had not been easy. Her delegation had observed that amongst the activities scheduled for the Latin American region, there was no activity in the area of trade facilitation, which would help Latin American countries to remove the technical barriers that hampered trade. Taking into account the above, she was aware that UNIDO had approached the Latin American region to provide support and had a programme aimed at meeting the needs of those countries in the area of trade facilitation. She asked the Secretariat if the revised 2003 TA Plan would include the UNIDO programme or if there was another activity in conjunction with UNIDO that was in the process of being evaluated and that if for that reason had not been included in the programme. As an example of the urgent need she cited the results of a study which showed that 50 per cent of the problems occurring in intra-regional trade were related to the issue of trade facilitation, such as procedures, customs valuation, and transparency. She said that the Central American Vice-Presidents had attended a UNIDO Meeting in Vienna the previous week to support the programme that seemed to be generating increased competitiveness in the area. She emphasised the fact that other programmes existed in other organisations such as the World Trade Net in the ITC which could also play a role in the negotiations of WTO agreements, such programmes could be a good compliment to the work carried out by the WTO.","WTCOMTDM42.pdf","El, Salvador, Guatemala, UNIDO, Secretariat, UNIDO, UNIDO, UNIDO, Vienna, ITC, WTO, WTO"
"4456",4456,"60","60.      She went on to say that her delegation shared the concerns expressed by other donors regarding the costing of the 2003 TA Plan. It was reasonable for Members to expect that the cost would have remained roughly the same for approximately the same number of projects. The high estimated cost of the 2003 TA Plan presented donor delegations with a serious challenge to convince their budget authorities to be forthcoming. Donors would, in that light have to carefully consider the 2003 TA Plan. Her Government, like others would have to justify budgetary requests and demonstrate that money was spent effectively. The amounts spent through September on the projects in the 2002 TA Plan seemed surprisingly low to her Government and that made it even more difficult to argue for an increase in the WTO budget. Her delegation joined the delegation of Canada and others in calling for a full account of the spending on the 2002 TA Plan, including information on short term costs, long term projects and how to justify that some short term programmes were more expensive than long term ones. That was particularly important when delegations approached their budgetary authorities with such a large increase in expenditures. Her Government was a large bilateral donor in the area of trade-related technical assistance and capacity building and had contributed approximately US$620 million in that area in fiscal year 2002. It remained committed to trade-related technical assistance and capacity building and wished to keep contributing. However, a                                                                                    WT/COMTD/M/42                                                                                           Page 29 demonstrated effective management of the funds contributed was critical in that respect. Her delegation welcomed the effort on the part of Members to look into how future TRTA in the WTO could be made effective. It also welcomed the opportunity to work with the delegation of South Africa and other interested Members to ensure that the quality of TRTA would be constantly improved. Her delegation supported the proposal made by the representative of Canada that the 2003 TA Plan be reviewed in conjunction with the Committee on BFA.","WTCOMTDM42.pdf","Members, WTO, Canada, Members, TRTA, WTO, South, Africa, Members, Canada, Committee, BFA"
"4455",4455,"6","6.      The Chairman said that at previous meetings the Committee had had before it a number of outstanding requests for observer status. Those came from the League of Arab States, OPEC, the Gulf Organization for Industrial Consulting, the Organisation Internationale de la Francophonie and the Common Fund for Commodities. The positions of delegations were well known and on the record. He proposed that, unless there had been any recent change of position, Members revert to those requests at the next formal meeting of the CTD.","WTCOMTDM42.pdf","Chairman, Committee, League, of, Arab, States, OPEC, Gulf, Organization, for, Industrial, Consulting, Organisation, Internationale, de, la, Francophonie, Members, CTD"
"4454",4454,"59","59.      The representative of the United States said that her Government was pleased with the demonstrated commitment of the Director-General, the Secretariat staff and the Membership to the critical task of providing TRTA and capacity building. She said that the development and the implementation of the 2002 TA Plan had been a challenge for the WTO. Members had undertaken a complex process and difficult challenges lay ahead. Her delegation was pleased that the Secretariat had noted Members concerns and had attempted to learn lessons from the experiences it had gained in 2002. Her delegation believed that a strategic approach was critical as Members moved forward. It was important that the Secretariat had chosen to focus its 2003 TA Plan on its areas of competence related to trade negotiations as well as implementation and long term integration. It was particularly important that the Secretariat would be working with other institutions to improve the quality of the jointly delivered programmes. The 2003 TA Plan represented an effort to rationalise Members' work. The effort to blend bilateral and regional programmes was important as was the effort to reduce the number of ad hoc activities although Members knew that flexibility was required in the area of TRTA. There was an attempt to have a range of shorter and longer-term projects to meet developing country needs and there was an effort to incorporate different approaches and new tools. Her delegation shared the views of others that Members had to find a way to make progress on technical assistance and capacity building while not undermining WTO's central task. There was a need to deliver real liberalisation for the whole trading system to benefit the global economy. She agreed with other delegations that it was important to consider how the Secretariat might cooperate with other organisations to deliver projects even in its core areas of competence. There was a lot of work to be done as technical assistance had to be delivered effectively while not undermining the servicing of negotiations.","WTCOMTDM42.pdf","United, States, Director-General, Secretariat, TRTA, WTO, Members, Secretariat, Members, Members, Secretariat, Secretariat, Members, Members, Members, WTO, Secretariat"
"4453",4453,"58","58.      The representative of Hong Kong, China said that his delegation found the new ideas in the draft 2003 TA Plan interesting. Comments had been made on the concept of trade clinics. His delegation wished to hear in more detail how the concept of trade clinics would be implemented in practice and especially what the mechanism would be for making requests and what type of assistance the clinics would provide. His delegation appreciated the efforts to further cooperation with the international standard setting organisations on the issue of standards. That initiative was particularly welcomed as it related to one of the implementation issues that developing countries were concerned about. Some of them were of the view that technical standards could become an increasing barrier to trade when tariffs were lowered. He requested more information on how the WTO intended to increase cooperation with international standard setting organisations. His delegation welcomed the ideas of training trainers, involving academia and using WTO reference centres. In that regard, his delegation requested the Secretariat to provide updated information on the WTO reference centres, so that Members would get a better idea of the people involved and whether involvement in the reference centres could be enhanced. He said that he had noticed that the 2003 TA Plan covered many areas and that many of the requests submitted by Members might not be met. The fact that the draft 2003 WT/COMTD/M/42 Page 28 TA Plan had been produced in advance gave Members an overview of the global shape of it and enabled them to compare it with the overall objective of the DDA and to consider whether the 2003 TA Plan could fully meet the needs of developing countries. He noticed that a range of activities were already organised in some negotiating areas. However, in other areas relating to negotiations, such as trade facilitation, no global activity seemed to be planned. He asked Members whether that suited their needs from a negotiations point of view. His delegation agreed with the points raised by the representatives of the Philippines and Uganda regarding the supply side constraints of the Secretariat in providing technical assistance. In that regard he echoed the delegations which had called for a review of the implementation of the 2002 TA Plan. He said that it seemed that only a portion of the 2002 activities had been implemented. That was a reflection of the fact that the number of technical assistance activities had increased since 2001 and that Members needed to review the situation in order to ensure that the implementation of the 2003 TA Plan would not put unrealistic demands on the Secretariat which also had to service the negotiations. The Trade Negotiations Committee (TNC) had recently stated that those negotiations were going to intensify.","WTCOMTDM42.pdf","Hong, Kong, China, WTO, WTO, Secretariat, WTO, Members, Members, Members, DDA, Members, Philippines, Uganda, Secretariat, Members, Secretariat, Trade, Negotiations, Committee, TNC"
"4452",4452,"57","57.      The representative of the Slovak Republic said that the draft 2003 TA Plan was a good basis for further discussion. He thanked the Director-General for his focus on the issue of technical assistance and capacity building for the implementation of the DDA and the training of negotiators in WTO matters. He said that in the 2003 TA Plan priority attention had been paid to the developing and the least-developed countries; however in that regard he pointed out that there were other countries with specific needs and interests resulting from difficult transformation processes and he hoped that the needs of economies in transition had been recognised in the preparation of the 2003 TA Plan. There were some activities on the national and regional level which would take place in Central and Eastern Europe and the geographical balance in terms of benefitting from those activities was well known. He thanked the Secretariat for the possibility of having continued access to WTO technical assistance and capacity building activities. His Government's experience was positive and it showed how essential the national seminars, training courses and other regional activities were. In that regard, he underlined the need for strengthening relations between the WTO Secretariat and agencies that delivered national and regional technical assistance activities. One of his Government's positive experiences was connected with the cooperation between the WTO Secretariat and the Joint Vienna Institute. He hoped that that would continue as both organisations would benefit from their efforts.","WTCOMTDM42.pdf","Slovak, Republic, Director-General, DDA, WTO, Eastern, Europe, Secretariat, WTO, WTO, Secretariat, WTO, Secretariat, Joint, Vienna, Institute"
"4451",4451,"56","56.      The representative of Hungary said that her delegation believed that the technical assistance activities provided by the WTO effectively responded to the needs that emerged from the Mandate in the Doha Ministerial Declaration in order to promote the process for the Fifth Ministerial Conference. Her delegation was pleased that Central and Eastern European Countries were involved in some of the training programmes. Her Government's experiences with the training programmes were positive and the participation of her Government's experts in those programmes had deepened their knowledge in specific matters relating to the WTO. She hoped that similar participation would be possible in future WTO technical assistance activities.","WTCOMTDM42.pdf","Hungary, WTO, Doha, WTO, WTO"
"4450",4450,"55","55.      The representative of Japan said that his delegation shared many of the views expressed by the Director-General in his introductory remarks. His delegation was aware that the Technical Cooperation Division had worked hard to reflect the lessons learnt from ongoing activities and would try to improve those activities in the 2003 TA Plan. He said that the cost estimate had surprised his delegation. His delegation believed, as mentioned by other delegations, that Members needed to be informed in detail of the 2002 activities before examining the cost of the 2003 TA Plan. The 2003 TA Plan could not be endorsed in isolation from its financial implications. Therefore, he agreed with the proposal made by the representative of Canada that there be a joint session between the CTD and the Committee on BFA. The needs of LDCs, developing countries and economies in transition went far beyond the practical responses that could be given by the WTO. His delegation had observed that TRTA was one of the areas where an excellent partnership among developed and developing countries had developed. He said that he appreciated the initiative taken by the delegations of South Africa and Canada to hold constructive discussions on that issue. His delegation was building further cooperative relations with Members on the issue of TRTA. Such a practise should be strengthened through constructive discussions in the CTD, aiming at pragmatic and practical solutions. In that regard his delegation was encouraged by the statement made by the representative of the Philippines. With respect to coordination with other agencies he said that his delegation understood that there were three pillars of activities. He believed that the WTO could be an advocate of the third pillar of technical assistance for the construction of commercial infrastructure while not directly dealing with the issue. Coordination with other international agencies was therefore important for developing countries to be integrated in the multilateral trading system. The Secretariat needed to inform Members of the detailed arrangements of such coordination, including information regarding co-financing arrangements for the joint activities carried out in 2002. During the discussions on the 2002 TA Plan his delegation had raised issues of flexibility. Ad hoc activities should not be allowed to damage the TA Plan. Flexibility had to be within acceptable margins of the 2003 TA Plan. Some delegations had mentioned that bilateral donors had been considering extending their bilateral technical assistance in the field of trade. However, due to the policy issues                                                                                    WT/COMTD/M/42                                                                                           Page 27 involved it was sometimes difficult for bilateral donors to implement that assistance alone. His Government was one such donor that had been working hard to collaborate with the WTO to extend assistance based on its own bilateral scheme to TRTA. That would be implemented with the cooperation of UNCTAD later in 2002. In addition, some developing countries had raised the point that they were willing to host such TRTA activities in their regions and in some cases they had done so. Considering those requests and the mood among the Members, his delegation believed that a certain amount of flexibility and a certain level of ad hoc activities might be permitted in order to respond to such positive action by Member countries. He concluded by saying that his delegation was concerned with some of the proposals made by the Secretariat, including the cost estimates. His delegation was ready to actively participate in the debate on TRTA in the CTD or in the Committee on BFA.","WTCOMTDM42.pdf","Japan, Director-General, Technical, Cooperation, Division, Members, Canada, CTD, Committee, BFA, WTO, South, Africa, Canada, Members, CTD, Philippines, WTO, Secretariat, Members, WTO, UNCTAD, Members, Member, Secretariat, TRTA, CTD, Committee, BFA"
"4449",4449,"54","54.      The representative of Norway said that her delegation was pleased to see that the elements in the 2003 TA Plan had been closely linked to the Doha Ministerial Declaration. That was the right way to move forward. Her delegation found part II on the ""Lessons from the Implementation of the 2002 Annual TA/CB Plan"" on page 5 in document WT/COMTD/W/104 useful, as those lessons could provide useful input to further improving the Plan. She said that bullet point 6 in paragraph 4 stated that recipient countries had expressed further needs for capacity building with a view to trade integration. She agreed with the representative of the European Commission and others that the WTO could not be expected to deliver such assistance, with the exception of coordinating cooperation with development organisations, bilateral donors and the recipient countries themselves. She said that her delegation would appreciate information from the Secretariat on any such additional assistance offered which went beyond the scope of the current work within the IF. It was necessary to anchor TRTA within the recipient countries, and integrate it with their PRSP's and their national development plans. She said that, as mentioned by the representative of Switzerland, her delegation believed that it was important to consider the long term effects of the proposed trade clinics and how to anchor them within the recipient countries themselves to ensure sustainability. Her delegation would appreciate the Secretariat's views as to whether those trade clinics would also cover ad-hoc requests. Concerning the requests for assistance from the 118 countries, her delegation had noted with interest that the Singapore issues ranked top of the list. Page 8 of document WT/COMTD/W/104 contained references to new guidelines that the Secretariat had been following during the drafting of the 2003 TA Plan. On page 19, in paragraph 48, the Secretariat had indicated the need for clearer guidelines with regard to how the DDAGTF might be used. Her delegation would appreciate further information with respect to any problems related to the allocation of the funds, and the reasoning behind the request for clearer guidelines. She concluded by underlining the need to give particular attention to the needs of the LDCs. In that respect, it was appropriate that 47 per cent of the national activities, as mentioned in paragraph 34, would, if adopted, take place in an LDC. Further follow-up of the IF for the TRTA delivered to LDCs would play a key part in the process of meeting the needs of LDCs.","WTCOMTDM42.pdf","Norway, European, Commission, WTO, Secretariat, TRTA, Switzerland, Secretariat, Singapore, Secretariat, Secretariat, TRTA, LDCs"

The representative of Switzerland said that his delegation valued the efforts made by the Secretariat to enhance the quality and impact of its technical assistance in the face of increased requests from beneficiary countries. He agreed with the Secretariat that it was necessary to provide a sharp strategic direction for WTO technical assistance. His delegation welcomed the will to take account of the lessons drawn from the implementation of the 2002 Plan and of the suggestions made by the Membership at the High Level Meeting on Technical Cooperation in July 2002. In that respect, his delegation was of the opinion that special attention should be given to the technical cooperation audit carried out earlier in the year (WT/COMTD/W/97). The Audit had presented sound recommendations concerning inter alia objective setting for major groups of technical assistance projects and the need to give higher priority to the selection of participants of training activities. He said that it had been a deception for his delegation to notice that, in spite of the Secretariat's objective to limit ad hoc activities to a minimum, their level in 2002 continued to undermine the rationality of WTO TA Plans. Stricter and transparent measures had to be taken to bring those activities under control. So far 1038 requests for technical assistance had been communicated to the Secretariat for 2003. His delegation believed that that trend should be viewed positively since it showed a growing interest for TRTA among developing countries. However, it highlighted the necessity of sorting and rationalizing those demands. The idea proposed by the Secretariat to ensure that requests were linked to priorities identified by Members in their development plans and poverty reduction strategies was of utmost importance. His delegation approved of the direction taken by the Secretariat on that matter. At the same time, his delegation was aware that that would not be an easy task, since not all Members had plans that could help them identify the right priorities. For the future, Members might wish to search for solutions that strengthened the link between national plans and the delivery of technical assistance. The high number of demands forced Members to look for innovative solutions. The proposals presented in the 2003 TA Plan were interesting, such as grouping national requests into a regional activity, systematic and cumulative capacity building, and developing partnerships with other multilateral institutions. Partnerships with other multilateral institutions were necessary, especially in the fields beyond the direct competence of the WTO. In that connection, he asked for more information regarding the partnerships the Secretariat intended to be build with bilateral donors. He said that with respect to the delivery modes, his delegation feared that the trade clinics approach for special and immediate needs could end up increasing the number of ad-hoc activities. He said that the three pillars for the 2003 TA Plan, namely capacity building for effective negotiations, the legal implementation of WTO Agreements, and trade integration seemed appropriate. He agreed that the WTO needed to concentrate on its core competencies. He concluded by saying that the costing that had been proposed for the 2003 TA Plan had surprised his delegation. The 2003 TA Plan and its costing needed further consideration. In that sense, his delegation supported the request by the representatives of the European Commission and Canada that the Secretariat provide a detailed report on the implementation and accomplishment of the 2002 TA Plan so that Members would have a better view of what was possible for 2003.

"4447",4447,"52","52.     The representative of the Philippines said that she was pleased with the Director-General's policy statement, in particular that the WTO Secretariat would focus its technical assistance on what it did best, namely on technical assistance to build effective negotiation capacity, explaining the agreements, their implementation and the nuances of those agreements. She agreed with the representative of Canada that the Secretariat should not take on more responsibilities than it could handle. She said that there was a need for the Secretariat to coordinate with other institutions that were in a position to deliver the requested technical assistance. Her delegation was pleased to hear that WTO's technical assistance was not only geared towards the Cancun Ministerial Conference, but beyond it. That showed the commitment of the WTO to enable Members to become effective negotiators in the long run. The policy statement by the Director-General also mentioned coordination, which all Members could agree with. The Director-General had stated that the Secretariat would continue its coordination with other agencies and advocate the role technical assistance could play in the construction of commercial infrastructure if delivered in collaboration with development institutions and bilateral donors. The focus should be on quality and not quantity of WTO's technical assistance activities. She commended the Secretariat for the way in which it had accomplished the process of arriving at the 2003 TA Plan. She said that her delegation could claim ownership of the 2003 TA Plan because it had worked closely with the Secretariat in drawing it up. Like other delegations, her delegation had had to prioritise its requests. She said that the transparency                                                                                        WT/COMTD/M/42                                                                                               Page 25 shown was important. She had been surprised by the transparency shown in Annex 2 of document WT/COMTD/W/104/Add.1. She said that taking on board the lessons that the Secretariat had learnt from the implementation of the 2002 TA Plan was a move in the right direction. It was important to continue to learn from past experiences and find ways of improving TA delivery beyond the implementation of the 2002 TA Plan.                 In that connection, page 3 of document WT/COMTD/W/104/Add.1 provided a good summary of where things stood. She said that she had noticed that the number of national activities exceeded the number of regional activities. She had identified two specific national activities for the Philippines. The Secretariat should feel free to inquire from her delegation if it was prepared to convert those activities to regional activities that would enable more countries to benefit. The multiplier affect of regional activities for WTO Members would be enhanced if the venues of those activities were as dispersed as possible. With respect to the budget, she said that she sympathised with potential donors. She agreed with the suggestion by the representatives of the European Communities and Canada that Members receive information on how much of the 2002 budget had been spent and how much of it could be carried over to 2003.","WTCOMTDM42.pdf","Philippines, Director-General, WTO, Secretariat, Canada, Secretariat, Secretariat, WTO, Cancun, Ministerial, Conference, WTO, Members, Director-General, Members, Director-General, Secretariat, WTO, Secretariat, Secretariat, Secretariat, Philippines, Secretariat, WTO, Members, Canada, Members"
"4446",4446,"51","51.      The representative of the Czech Republic said that he was aware of the complexity involved in drawing up the 2003 TA Plan, given the resource limits Members faced, the large number of requests for technical assistance and the core business of the WTO, which was that of being a negotiating forum. His delegation was impressed by the number of activities proposed by the Secretariat as well as the ability of Members to identify their needs. It was apparent from the 2003 TA Plan that improved coordination and coherence within the Secretariat and with multilateral agencies and donors was more important than ever before. High quality technical assistance delivery and effective use of scarce resources should be the leading principles. The Director-General and others had mentioned that and his delegation shared those sentiments. It was important that technical assistance and capacity building remained focused on activities related to the implementation of the DDA. Equally important was to strike a geographical balance in terms of the Members that benefited from those types of activities. There was no doubt that priority attention would continue to be paid to developing and least-developed countries. However there were other Members who had specific needs and they had every right to claim access to the programmes organized and financed through the 2003 TA Plan. From that perspective, his delegation appreciated that the draft 2003 TA Plan attempted to respond to some of the needs of the countries in Central and Eastern Europe and to their interest in having continued access to the WTO technical assistance and capacity building activities. He said that there was a need to further develop relations between the WTO Secretariat and other regional and multilateral agencies which delivered technical assistance. His Government had experienced how beneficial such relations could be for all involved. An example was the close cooperation between the WTO Secretariat and the Joint Vienna Institute, which was a common destination for his Government's officials who took part in various activities related to trade and WTO.","WTCOMTDM42.pdf","Czech, Republic, Members, WTO, Secretariat, Members, Secretariat, Director-General, DDA, Members, Members, Eastern, Europe, WTO, WTO, Secretariat, WTO, Secretariat, Joint, Vienna, Institute, WTO"
"4445",4445,"50","50.      The representative of India said that in his introductory remarks, the Director-General had underscored the importance of quality over quantity in the delivery of technical assistance as well as the need to have cumulative, systemic, and sustainable capacity building. Many delegations had underscored the importance of those elements in their interventions. In that context, he reiterated that the technical assistance and capacity building efforts should not only be event-based, but lead to effective institutional and human resource development in the recipient countries. The Secretariat had broadly classified technical assistance and capacity building into three categories. Technical assistance for building effective capacity for trade negotiators, technical assistance for the understanding of the rules and their implementation, and technical assistance for the development of commercial infrastructure. As alluded to by a number of delegations, technical assistance in all three categories would be important for many developing countries and LDCs. His Government had submitted its requests for technical assistance and capacity building for 2003. However, it had subsequently been requested to identify two priority national activities, which would be incorporated in the 2003 TA Plan. Cutting down the requests had not been an easy task. It was clear from the documents containing the 2003 TA Plan and the presentation which had been made by Mr. Osakwe, that there was a gap between demand and supply. His delegation noted the new tools and activities included in the 2003 TA Plan such as outreach programmes and internship programmes for regional co-ordinators. The Secretariat documents had been only recently received by delegations and his WT/COMTD/M/42 Page 24 Government was still examining them. His delegation would comment on their substance at a later stage. While his delegation agreed that outreach programmes would be useful, it was not certain that the cost of those programmes should be financed from the technical assistance budget, which was meant for capacity building in developing countries. His delegation welcomed the Director-General's statement that the Secretariat's technical assistance objectives were not only focussed on the next WTO Ministerial Conference but also on establishing an architecture for WTO technical assistance. He said that there should not be a presumption that technical assistance and capacity building on certain issues would necessarily lead to some decisions at the Fifth Ministerial Conference. The purpose was to enable developing country Governments to better evaluate the implications of closer multilateral cooperation for their development policies and objectives, for them to be able to make informed decisions at the Cancun Ministerial Meeting.","WTCOMTDM42.pdf","India, Director-General, Secretariat, Osakwe, Secretariat, Director-General, Secretariat, WTO, WTO, Cancun, Ministerial, Meeting"

"4443",4443,"49","49.      She went on to say that her delegation had taken note of the Secretariat's comments on the issue of ""ad hocism"" and looked forward to a continued flexible delivery of WTO technical assistance both in the remainder of 2002 and in the 2003 TA Plan. She said that her delegation also welcomed the statement made by the Secretariat that technical assistance and market access were complementary not substitutes. The representative of South Africa had mentioned the issue of S&D and she said that Members needed to avoid the tendency of reducing S&D to technical assistance because the two were not substitutes either. She said that her delegation found it positive that the Secretariat recognised special challenges in some regions and welcomed that the Caribbean Community had been identified as a region facing significant trade policy and trade development challenges. In addition to the sub- regional institutions mentioned by the Secretariat, the Caribbean Development Bank was also involved in the developmental efforts of the Caribbean countries. Her delegation was pleased to see a commitment to continue ""Geneva week"". Many Caribbean countries were non-residents and ""Geneva week"" was an important tool for those Members. Her delegation also welcomed the new products in the 2003 TA Plan, which had been elaborated in the Secretariat largely by the Training Institute. Those included the training-of-trainers programme, the training courses for trade negotiators and the internships. Her delegation was interested in receiving more details on those new products. Her delegation was pleased that the decentralised regional trade policy courses in Nairobi and Casablanca had gone well. In those exercises Members could see not just the training of officials but the linkage between the WTO and academic institutions in the field, as well as the opportunity for the training of trainers. Her delegation looked forward to the evaluation of those programmes and to their extension to other regions such as the Caribbean region.","WTCOMTDM42.pdf","Secretariat, WTO, Secretariat, South, Africa, S&D, Members, Secretariat, Caribbean, Community, Secretariat, Caribbean, Development, Bank, Caribbean, Caribbean, Members, Secretariat, Training, Institute, Nairobi, Casablanca, Members, WTO, Caribbean"
"4442",4442,"48","48.     The representative of Barbados said that the presence of the Director-General and the DDGs' at the meeting served to highlight the importance given to technical assistance in the WTO. Her delegation thought that the strategic direction being adopted by the Secretariat in the elaboration of the 2003 Plan seemed well thought out. The strategic focus, in conjunction with the guiding principles that had been outlined, provided a framework within which the delivery of WTO technical assistance might be effectively carried out. She said that she wished to highlight a few issues which her delegation felt were of specific importance. The first was the question of the sustainability of the WTO's technical assistance and capacity building activities. There was no need to recall the importance of ensuring that TRTA and capacity building activities mandated at the Fourth Ministerial Conference received full implementation and follow through. With respect to the warning made not                                                                                     WT/COMTD/M/42                                                                                            Page 23 to allow a situation of donor fatigue to develop, she said that there was no space in the undertaking for donor fatigue. Second, her Government attached importance to coordination between agencies, donors and beneficiaries in the delivery of technical assistance. The aim of such coordination was to ensure that needs were identified and met and that no critical issue remained outside the jurisdiction of one institution or the other. It had to be ensured that nothing fell through the cracks. She had raised that point because the Secretariat had rightly identified what it could not do. Some donors in other fora had indicated the types of assistance that they would prefer to fund, either bilaterally or through other multilateral agencies. Members therefore needed to ensure that no type of assistance became left out in the process such as the issue of the development of commercial infrastructure. On the question of national versus regional activities, she said that while she agreed with the need to seek quality over quantity, technical assistance needed to be properly focused in order to be effective. Therefore, it was clear that a balance had to be struck between regional and national activities. The goal should be that of effective technical assistance delivery rather than ""the greater yield"".","WTCOMTDM42.pdf","Barbados, Director-General, WTO, Secretariat, WTO, WTO, TRTA, Secretariat, Members"
"4441",4441,"47","47.       The representative of Uganda said that his delegation associated itself with the statement made by the representative of Kenya on behalf of the African Group, and the statement made by the representative of Zambia on behalf of the LDCs. His delegation had not had the time to study the 2003 TA Plan and would provide detailed comments on it at a later stage. However, his delegation was in a position to comment on the vision, objectives and approach of the 2003 TA Plan. He thanked the Director-General for having emphasised that technical assistance should be cumulative, sustainable and result in long term benefits. His delegation shared the view that, apart from the day-to-day training programmes, there was a need for the construction of trade infrastructure, which was not within the WTO's competence. However, the WTO had the leverage to coordinate with other organisations such as the World Bank, UNDP, and UNIDO to ensure that activities were sequenced in order to have maximum impact. The issue of collaboration with other institutions was important in implementing the 2003 TA Plan. His delegation had repeatedly said that the WTO was able to explain the rules, the consequences of not complying with them and give advice on how to comply. However, the WTO did not have the competence in all areas of interest to developing countries and there was a need for it to collaborate with other organisations. In some areas, such as the participation in negotiations, it was difficult for the Secretariat to give developing countries negotiating positions, as the WTO was a rule making body and as the Secretariat was servicing the negotiations. The WTO was not completely irrelevant in that respect, but cooperation with other relevant organisations would have positive impact. That was also true for capacity building for the effective participation of developing countries in trade. He said that the 2003 TA Plan should remain principally demand driven in that the beneficiary countries should define the needs. Any attempt to devise other means of needs identification would be a step in the wrong direction. In its PRSP programme, the World Bank emphasised consultation with the stakeholders. He did not know why the question of how to identify the needs had been raised. The needs had to be left to the Members to identify. The demand on the WTO to carry out a number of TA activities and at the same time to service negotiations was a dilemma for the WTO. On the one hand, Members needed technical assistance which involved the participation of a large part of the Secretariat. That might lead to difficulties in servicing the negotiations. On the other hand, without technical assistance, negotiations would be held with unprepared developing country delegations. Developing country Members would then sign agreements which they would not be able to implement because of a lack of capacity to do so. A balance between staff time spent on technical assistance and servicing negotiations was needed if Members were to move forward. The proposal made by the delegation of Canada with respect to the building of partnerships with other organisations was a possible solution.","WTCOMTDM42.pdf","Uganda, Kenya, African, Group, Zambia, LDCs, Director-General, WTO, WTO, World, Bank, UNDP, UNIDO, WTO, WTO, Secretariat, WTO, Secretariat, WTO, World, Bank, Members, WTO, WTO, Members, Secretariat, Members, Members, Canada"
"4440",4440,"46","46.      The representative of Australia said that, like other delegations, her delegation recognised the importance of technical assistance for developing and least-developed countries as a core element of the WTO's work. In that regard her delegation appreciated the comments made by the Director-General. Her delegation welcomed the Secretariat's efforts to draw on lessons from the 2002 TA Plan and recognised that while much work was being done to address issues of concern, Members had ongoing responsibilities to improve the 2003 TA Plan whenever possible. Recent discussions had highlighted the large number of requests for assistance received by the Secretariat. That raised concerns relating to the capacity of the Secretariat to respond to them. Her delegation welcomed efforts to address those issues by the provision of a more focused, sequenced and sustainable programme of assistance. Her delegation also wondered whether a stronger effort to integrate trade into development strategies would allow beneficiary countries to divert some types of requests to alternative responsible agencies, thereby allowing international organisations and donors to collaborate more effectively. Her Government was keen to ensure that the technical assistance mandates from the Doha Ministerial Declaration were met. Her Government supported an increased focus and responsibility for TRTA in other committees and working groups and was working to ensuring that its bilateral assistance was complimentary to the Secretariat's activities. Her delegation recognised the need to work together to analyse the needs of developing country members and the WT/COMTD/M/42 Page 22 need to consider ways of mainstreaming trade into national and regional development strategies. The shared goal was the delivery of effective, high quality assistance to Members. With respect to the Global Trust Fund, her Government was considering issues relating to further contributions and would need to study the document provided on the financial impact of the 2003 technical assistance training activities (CRP(02)/3). Being a donor, her Government had clear requirements for evaluations of activities and monitoring of the expenditures. She said that her delegation appreciated the Secretariat's efforts to ensure transparency in its reporting and evaluation work. Nevertheless, she asked the Secretariat to provide further information on the quality and effectiveness of the activities delivered under the 2002 TA Plan.","WTCOMTDM42.pdf","Australia, WTO, Director-General, Secretariat, Members, Secretariat, Secretariat, TRTA, Secretariat, Members, Secretariat, Secretariat"

The representative of Mauritania said that his delegation associated itself with the statements made by the representative of Kenya on behalf of the African Group and the representative of Zambia on behalf of the LDCs. He said that he was pleased to hear the Director-General confirm that technical assistance would be one of the four pillars of his mandate. The priorities he had set out were clear and consistent with what had already been achieved in the spirit of the DDA. The Director-General had said that the key to successful capacity building was for it to be cumulative, sustainable and of high quality. He hoped that that would provide a new momentum to technical assistance which would be beneficial to developing countries and LDCs. His delegation commended the Director-General for having begun consultations regarding the IF. Before considering the substance of the proposed 2003 TA Plan, he agreed that the basis of the 2003 TA Plan should be the needs of beneficiary countries. In that regard, his delegation was grateful for the activities planned in Mauritania in the areas of capacity building and implementation of agreements. His delegation would cooperate with the Secretariat to achieve the aims that had been set out in the ambitious 2003 TA Plan.","WTCOMTDM42.pdf","Mauritania, Kenya, African, Group, Zambia, LDCs, Director-General, DDA, Director-General, Director-General, Mauritania, Secretariat"
"4438",4438,"44","44.      The representative of Senegal said that it was unnecessary to recall how important technical assistance was for developing countries in general and LDCs in particular. He commended the Director-General for his outlook on technical assistance and on the priority areas he had set. He said that he was pleased to see that the Secretariat had begun work on the 2003 TA Plan earlier than in the previous year as it had taken some time for the CTD to consider the 2002 TA Plan. Although the many national technical assistance requests could not be met, some of them could be met at the regional level. His delegation believed that Member's requests should be approved on an indicative basis as it would be good if some ad hoc requests could be met as well as long as they remained within the overall budget. He said that it was appropriate, as the Director-General had pointed out, that technical assistance be considered for a period extending beyond the Fifth Ministerial Meeting. That was important for the LDCs within the IF. It was a matter of having clear objectives for WTO TA. The third type of technical assistance mentioned, i.e. for commercial infrastructure, was important for the LDCs as, second to market access, it was a question of having effective access. That could only be achieved if supply capacity was improved. However, it was not for the WTO to carry out all assistance alone. Some of it was within the mandate of other international organisations. Nevertheless, the WTO provided the framework for a broad overview of all trade-related questions. The Secretariat could still assist Members on demanding TA not related to its specific area of competence. He mentioned that the technical assistance programme in the TBT and SPS area had to be provided in cooperation with standard setting organisations for developing countries to really benefit. He concluded by saying that his delegation supported the statement made by the representative of Kenya.","WTCOMTDM42.pdf","Senegal, LDCs, Director-General, Secretariat, CTD, Member, Director-General, LDCs, WTO, LDCs, WTO, WTO, Secretariat, Members, TBT, SPS, Kenya"
"4437",4437,"43","43.      The representative of Sri Lanka said that her delegation was pleased to note that the Director-General had identified technical assistance and capacity building as one of the four pillars that he intended to pursue during his term at the WTO. He had provided a broader definition of technical assistance by including programmes pertaining to building trade integration and commercial infrastructure in developing countries. Her delegation shared the comments made by most delegations, particularly those made by the representatives of Kenya and Mauritius on the proposed 2003 TA Plan. She welcomed the Director-General's new initiative that the WTO Secretariat through its 2003 TA Plan intended to respond to the needs of regions such as Africa, South and Central Asia and the Caribbean. Her delegation was pleased to note that priority would also be given to countries in the South Asian Association of Regional Cooperation (SAARC) region. The region consisted of three developing countries and four LDCs, two of which had not yet acceded to the WTO. It was therefore a region with special challenges that required enhanced technical assistance. She said that her delegation was sympathetic towards the Secretariat's situation with respect to delivering the technical assistance and capacity building programmes. As had been stated, the 2003 TA Plan had been designed on the basis of refined requests received from developing countries. The requests varied because of the different levels of development among requesting Members. In that sense, a programme identified by one member might be inadequate from another Member's point of view. She said that her delegation did not agree with what had been said by the representative of Mexico as some developing countries needed human resource development just as much as institutional building. It was not possible for one single programme to suit every developing country. In that regard, her delegation was grateful that the document containing the 2003 TA Plan captured the varying degrees of technical assistance and capacity building needs of developing countries. She believed that Members would be able to approve the proposed 2003 TA Plan which represented the minimal list of technical assistance requirements of developing countries. She had heard other delegations' concerns with respect to having to prioritise their requests and not having all of them included in the 2003 TA Plan. Her delegation shared the views stated by the representative of Uruguay and her Government had also had to prioritise its requests to meet a minimal list of needs. She hoped that the funds necessary to implement the 2003 TA Plan would be secured.

"4436",4436,"42","42.     The representative of Cuba said that her delegation would study the documents in order to comment on the substance at the following meeting. She said that technical assistance provided by the WTO had to have two fundamental objectives to become an effective tool for the integration of developing countries into the multilateral trading system. Those were facilitating the effective participation of developing countries in negotiations and helping to facilitate increased market access. With respect to the participation of developing countries in negotiations, important contributions were made by the seminars, workshops and various courses included in the 2003 TA Plan. However, human infrastructure was not sufficient for the exporters of developing and least-developed countries to become competitive in the international market and have access to their principle market. Material WT/COMTD/M/42 Page 20 infrastructure was necessary to support national efforts to implement the rules conditioning the packaging, labeling and other technical regulations required by industrialized countries or to comply with SPS and environmental measures governing imports in the main markets and to get access to new technological developments that were already part of the new conditions in international trade. Document WT/COMTD/W/100 contained an interesting characteristic of the growth of world exports, namely its correlation with the level of technology. That was missing from the 2003 TA Plan. If Members did not wish developing countries to be condemned to be exporters of commodities whose prices declined by the day it was necessary for WTO's technical assistance to be closely coordinated with that of other institutions. She agreed with the representative of the European Commission that the WTO could not do everything alone. There were other international organisations which had comparative advantages in that respect, for instance the International Chamber of Commerce (ICC), the United Nations Conference of Trade and Development (UNCTAD), the Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO), the International Telecommunications Union (ITU), and the Common Fund for Commodities. In that connection she drew Members' attention to an ICC project connected to poverty alleviation through exports. That was an example of what other institutions were doing and what could be achieved by working in a coordinated fashion. The technical assistance that her Government country had received from the WTO had contributed to improving the awareness of the public and private sectors in her country but it was not sufficient. It was for that reason that her Government had presented its priorities for 2003. Taking into account that the document on the 2003 TA Plan had been recently distributed, she suggested that the item be kept on the agenda for the following meeting of the Committee so that delegations could analyse priorities bilaterally with the Secretariat. Technical assistance and capacity building was a matter that had been given priority by Ministers at the Doha Ministerial Conference and by the Director-General in his statements. Technical assistance together with market access were necessary for Members like Cuba that had an open economy with high export dependency.","WTCOMTDM42.pdf","Cuba, WTO, SPS, Members, WTO, European, Commission, WTO, International, Chamber, of, Commerce, ICC, United, Nations, Conference, of, Trade, and, Development, UNCTAD, Food, and, Agricultural, Organization, FAO, International, Telecommunications, Union, ITU, Members, ICC, WTO, Committee, Secretariat, Doha, Ministerial, Conference, Director-General, Members, Cuba"
"4435",4435,"41","41.     The representative of Morocco said that his delegation supported the statement made by the representative of Kenya on behalf of the African Group. The 2003 TA Plan would be of crucial importance for developing and least-developed countries in the present negotiating context of the WTO. The creation of a real development round as decided at the Doha Ministerial Conference would depend on the technical assistance and capacity building provided in the period before the Cancun Ministerial Conference keeping in mind that important decisions would have to be taken, for example with respect to the Singapore issues. The issue remained complex for developing countries. Only a real strengthening of negotiating techniques would assist developing and least-developed countries to fully integrate into the multilateral trading system. His delegation endorsed the approach presented by the Director-General making negotiating techniques and capacity building a priority. He recalled his delegation's thoughts presented at the high level meeting on technical assistance held in July 2002. The first related to specialisation. In a negotiating context, such as that post-Doha, it was indispensable to focus on the deepening of the WTO agreements rather than for Members to restrict themselves to consider the articles at face value. Such an approach required the identification of well-targeted themes for a specialized audience. Second, such activities should be included in a regional context. That would respond to the dual objective of rationalizing the cost of the training by including more participants and permitting greater interaction between participants with different backgrounds. Third, he agreed with the representative of Kenya that the technical assistance activities should be held over longer periods. Experience had shown that beneficiaries initially required more time to understand certain complex issues. Fourth, the theoretical courses should be complemented by practical experience. Training could be given in the form of internships in the administrations of Members with more developed structures for dealing with WTO issues. That kind of partnership between administrations should enable the recipients to deepen their practical knowledge by working with concrete cases experienced by the host administration. With respect to the 2003 TA Plan, he noted with satisfaction that three activities were foreseen for Morocco relating to investment, SPS and a technical mission to assist in the preparations for the trade policy review for Morocco scheduled for June 2003. His Government had indicated other priority areas such as transparency in government procurement and the upholding of other commercial matters. He said his delegation would revert to the trade policy course held in Casablanca at a later stage. A national evaluation of that course was being undertaken, keeping in mind that it was a pilot project.","WTCOMTDM42.pdf","Morocco, Kenya, African, Group, WTO, Doha, Ministerial, Conference, Cancun, Ministerial, Conference, Singapore, Director-General, WTO, Members, Kenya, Members, WTO, Morocco, SPS, Morocco, Casablanca"

He continued by saying that the representative of Bangladesh had mentioned that many Members focused on holding seminars and workshops without having the capacity to implement provisions. It would be an advantage to optimise technical assistance resources by having a common objective and not delivering 50 courses on the same subject. He said that resources should be geared towards a concrete objective. His delegation's proposal could facilitate for Members to benefit from each other's experiences and optimise resources in Members which might not have the same level of experience in that area. He said that his delegation would soon present that document to the Secretariat. Strengthening the capacities of institutions rather than humans was something that should be taken into account. That would make the allocation of technical assistance resources more effective.","WTCOMTDM42.pdf","Bangladesh, Members, Members, Members, Secretariat"

Those were the Arab Maghreb Union (AMU); the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS); the Economic Cooperation Organisation (ECO); the Inter-Arab Investment Guarantee Corporation; the Islamic Development Bank (IDB); the Organisation of African Unity (OAU); the Organisation of the Islamic Conference (OIC); the South Centre; the South Pacific Forum; the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP); the West African Economic and Monetary Union (WAEMU); and the World Intellectual Property Organisation (WIPO). He proposed that, in accordance with the CTD procedures, those Organizations be invited to the next formal meeting of the Committee.","WTCOMTDM42.pdf","Chairman, CTD, Members, Economic, Community, of, West, African, States, ECOWAS, Economic, Cooperation, Organisation, Inter-Arab, Investment, Guarantee, Corporation, Islamic, Development, Bank, IDB, Organisation, of, African, Unity, OAU, Organisation, Islamic, Conference, OIC, South, Centre, South, Pacific, Forum, United, Nations, Environment, Programme, UNEP, West, African, Economic, and, Monetary, Union, WAEMU, World, Intellectual, Property, Organisation, WIPO, CTD, Committee"
"4432",4432,"39","39.     The representative of Mexico said that technical assistance was a fundamental element to promote the development of developing countries and help them integrate into the multilateral trading system. He said that technical assistance should be directed towards assisting Members to utilise the rights conferred upon them in the multilateral agreements and in that respect assist them to comply with their obligations. A few Members like his own were both donors and recipients of technical assistance and had been able to gain experience on the effects of technical assistance. He said that the Director-General's fourth and fifth point in his introductory comments were fundamental. It was important to build technical capacity in Members. The quality of the various technical assistance programmes was also important. He agreed that quality should be given priority over quantity. A point that had been recently raised was the need to analyse the durability of the effects of technical assistance. What often occurred was that technical assistance to strengthening human capacities had diminishing returns with time. When human resources received training from various organisations, their knowledge became attractive for the private sector and in many instances the Government could not compete with salaries from the private sector. All the technical assistance granted towards human resources and human capacity building did not remain in the institutions. Members needed to focus on that if they wished to avail themselves of the various rights in the agreements. His delegation would be presenting a proposal on technical assistance with respect to TBT. That was an example of how Members could focus more on assistance to institutions rather than assistance to individuals. It was not that human capacity was not important, but institutions represented an essential element for the implementation of WTO agreements. His Government's TBT proposal would seek to ensure that technical assistance was directed to offices on rules, providing documentation and offering quality management services. Regardless of the operations involved, there would be a guide indicating the rights and obligations that existed in the framework of the TBT Agreement. By that example, his                                                                                    WT/COMTD/M/42                                                                                           Page 19 delegation felt that it was providing something that could be useful in other fora because institutions would be strengthened more than human capacities.","WTCOMTDM42.pdf","Mexico, Members, Members, Director-General, Members, Members, TBT, Members, WTO, TBT"
"4431",4431,"38","38.      The representative of Canada said that her delegation realised that when preparing the 2003 TA Plan it was difficult to accommodate the unlimited demands with the constrained ability to deliver. Her delegation appreciated that the 2003 TA Plan was available three months before the end of the year as that enabled delegations to work collectively, comment and have it approved, costed and funded for delivery in January 2003. She cited the informal network chaired by the delegation of South Africa, that had been created to discuss TA and said that it was open to all delegations that wished to participate in it. With respect to the 2003 TA Plan, she said that the Secretariat was attempting to do too much itself. More effort needed to be made to collaborate with bilateral donors, multilateral agencies and the larger developing countries that had indicated their willingness and ability to mentor. Her delegation wished to see a detailed, costed report of what had been accomplished during 2002 with the funds provided for the 2002 TA Plan. That report should also contain information regarding what had not been done due to the ad hoc activities undertaken. That would enable Members to consider what could be delivered in 2003. The 2003 TA Plan was an ambitious plan and considering what had been delivered of the 2002 TA Plan it seemed impossible that all of the activities in the 2003 TA Plan would be delivered. She said that her delegation was surprised by the costing because figures that had been presented at the Committee on BFA meeting were different. Her delegation had concluded from those figures that it would be difficult to spend CHF 25 million during the remainder of the year if only 11 million had been spent in the first nine months of 2002 on the 2002 TA Plan. CHF 5 million had already been committed for the 2003 TA Plan. Her delegation looked forward to the joint discussions of the Committee on BFA and the CTD on the costing of the 2003 TA Plan. Her delegation wished to see a closer relationship between the categories used in the 2003 TA Plan and the database that was being created for tracking all TRTA. That would enable Members to better analyse their collective progress as well as the progress of the WTO TA delivery.","WTCOMTDM42.pdf","Canada, South, Africa, Secretariat, Members, Committee, BFA, Committee, BFA, CTD, Members, WTO"
"4430",4430,"37","37.     The representative of Uruguay said that her delegation acknowledged the Secretariat's effort and attention paid to the priorities suggested by Member delegations. Her Government had requested WT/COMTD/M/42 Page 18 three national activities to be conducted in the areas of trade and the environment, dispute settlement and trade and investment. She noted that only one of those requests, that on trade and environment, had been included in the 2003 TA Plan. The requests her Government had made were of high priority as they were important components of the technical assistance that her country required. She hoped that due attention would be paid to those requests.","WTCOMTDM42.pdf","Uruguay, Secretariat, Member"
"4429",4429,"36","36.      The representative of Thailand said that her delegation was pleased that the Director-General had identified TA as one of his four priority areas. She also supported the focus on the quality of technical assistance. Importance therefore had to be attached to the evaluation system. She agreed with the Director-General that technical assistance should not only focus on the Fifth Ministerial Conference to be held in Cancun but that it should go beyond the Doha Ministerial Conference negotiations. In that regard she echoed the statement made by the representative of South Africa regarding the problems faced by developing countries with respect to non-tariff measures. Her delegation felt that that was a priority issue and it was Members' task to streamline that issue in their technical assistance and capacity building requests so that benefits could accrue to them through the technical assistance programmes. She thanked the Secretariat for the two national seminars on regional trade agreements and on investment granted to her country in 2002. Her delegation did not only attach importance to those negotiation issues but also to human resource development. She said that her delegation found the regional trade policy courses in Nairobi and Casablanca interesting. It would be useful to expand that kind of activity to other regions by making use of the existing facilities in each region. She gave the example of the ESCAP facility and the UNCTAD Trade Related Training Institute. Her delegation looked forward to working closely with the Secretariat on that issue.","WTCOMTDM42.pdf","Thailand, Director-General, Director-General, Cancun, South, Africa, Members, Secretariat, Nairobi, ESCAP, UNCTAD, Trade, Related, Training, Institute, Secretariat"
"4428",4428,"35","35.      He went on to say that he had been surprised by the costing of the 2003 TA Plan. The figures were three times higher than those for the 2002 TA Plan and a lot of the 2002 activities had not yet been implemented. He said that it was ambitious to triple the total amount without having been able to implement the planned activities for 2002. Members would have to consider both the financial side of the implementation of the 2002 activities and the implications of the estimated costs for 2003. When pledging for the 2003 TA Plan Members needed to be certain that the capacity was available to implement a meaningful and operational plan, which would help Members in their endeavours to achieve the objectives of the DDA. Until that was clear a pledging exercise would be difficult and donor fatigue could be expected. He concluded by raising the issue of the Secretariat's capacity to deliver 450 individual activities. When considering the three stage approach presented by the Director-General he acknowledged that the Secretariat had said that the third stage was not core WTO business. The development of infrastructure was more a question for other development cooperation partners. He also acknowledged that in the second stage there would be an attempt to outsource a lot of the activities to specialised development agencies. He said that he was still concerned that the WTO Secretariat alone would deliver the first stage. If it had to deliver 450 activities it was likely that Secretariat staff would spend more time flying around the globe than assisting the negotiating groups with the priority work before the Cancun Ministerial Conference and between the Cancun Ministerial Conference and the end of the negotiating round. He therefore urged the Secretariat to consider whether it would be possible to outsource some of those activities, either to regional public management institutions, university institutes or consultants, or by the way of tendering which would ensure the best value for money. Attempting to do everything on its own would over-stretch the limited human resources that the Secretariat possessed. Carrying out regional activities was also better as it was closer to the source where the capacity should be increased. It should therefore be done by local public or private organisations as far as possible. He said that the European Union had had a good experience in outsourcing those kinds of activities. His delegation looked forward to an in-depth discussion which should result in an effective 2003 TA Plan: a 2003 TA Plan which could be served by the limited resources, which was well-founded, which could be implemented during 2003, which was well linked to the priorities of the DDA and which remained within the reasonable limits of what could be pledged by the donor community in the WTO.","WTCOMTDM42.pdf","Members, Members, Members, DDA, Secretariat, Director-General, Secretariat, WTO, WTO, Secretariat, Secretariat, Cancun, Ministerial, Conference, Secretariat, Secretariat, European, Union, DDA, WTO"
"4427",4427,"34","34.      The representative of the European Communities said that his delegation was pleased to receive the 2003 TA Plan three months before the end of the year. That gave Members time to consider and comment on it. His delegation would discuss it with all member states of the European Communities. They were the major donors of the Trust Fund. Technical assistance was a crucial part of the DDA and it was encouraging that developing country Members had identified needs related to the negotiating agenda, including the Singapore issues, trade policy development, trade and services, rules, agriculture, market access and TRIPS implementation as a matter of priority. His delegation agreed with the three stage approach presented by the Director-General. Those three stages included technical assistance for negotiations, technical assistance for institutional capacity building and implementation, and technical assistance for trade integration and commercial infrastructure. That approach related closely to the European Commissions' objective identified in its recent communication to the Council of Ministers and the European Parliament. The European Commission had, in that communication spelt out how it intended to go about following up on the DDA, the Monterrey Conference on Financing for Development and the WSSD in Johannesburg. It laid down a doctrine for trade and development for the next five years which coincided with the three stage approach. It was important to acknowledge that the WTO could not do everything on its own as it was neither a full time training institute nor a development agency. The work on technical assistance and capacity building was important and related to the DDA but should not be to the detriment of the core work, which was negotiating new rules within a short time period. His delegation felt that some improvements could be made with respect to the implementation of the 2003 TA Plan. He would provide some observations and would further liase with the Secretariat. His delegation welcomed the needs based approach on which the 2003 TA Plan was based. However, he asked for more detailed information regarding the identification of those needs by developing countries and by the Secretariat. His delegation had the impression that the theoretical basis for imbedding technical assistance in the national development policies and in the PRSPs was not necessarily backed by reality and his delegation wished to hear more about the practical implementation of the process. His delegation welcomed the cooperation with the Bretton Woods institutions and the regional development banks and he asked for a detailed explanation as to what the practical arrangements for that cooperation were. He knew that the Director-General was keen to have close cooperation with other agencies. He requested that the Secretariat indicate how far it was responding to the technical assistance needs identified in the diagnostic trade integration studies undertaken by the IF. With respect to regional coverage, he stressed the importance of focusing on LDCs and low-income countries. He said that an issue that needed to be discussed in more detail was the evaluation of the implementation of the 2002 TA Plan. He understood that implementation was behind schedule and that by the end of 2002, a good part of the 2002 TA Plan would not have been implemented. He asked whether the non- implemented activities would be taken up in the following year in parallel with the 2003 TA Plan or whether they would be dropped. It was important to analyse in depth the financial side of the implementation of the 2002 TA Plan, for instance in terms of what had been spent, how procurement had been done and how much was left. That was crucial information to both the Members and the                                                                                     WT/COMTD/M/42                                                                                            Page 17 donors. It was important for donors to be able to make an assessment of the financial implications of the 2002 TA Plan before committing themselves to new pledges. It was a question of accountability towards their constituencies and taxpayers.","WTCOMTDM42.pdf","European, Communities, Members, Trust, Fund, DDA, Members, Singapore, Director-General, Council, of, Ministers, European, Parliament, European, Commission, DDA, Monterrey, WSSD, Johannesburg, WTO, DDA, Secretariat, Secretariat, Director-General, Secretariat, Members"
"4426",4426,"33","33.     On the issue of the nature of the requests submitted by Members he went on to say that it was not surprising to note that, in addition to the requests for the more conventional modes of technical assistance, there was at present a shift towards more resource intensive activities such as internships and national short trade policy courses in an effort to build capacity. As the work programme and the negotiations launched at the Doha Ministerial Conference intensified, Members requests for technical assistance in newer areas would increase as there was greater value added to be gained from such programmes. His delegation was able to speak of the benefits of such programmes as it had been a beneficiary of the WTO mission internship programme which had been introduced on a pilot basis by the WTO in 2001. He noted that in response, the Secretariat had undertaken to develop various modes of technical assistance such as seminars, workshops, training activities, training of trainers, and distance learning programmes. He also noted the development of the two new modes of technical assistance, namely the trade clinics and the use of the WTO references centres as a point for WT/COMTD/M/42 Page 16 establishing training of trainer programmes. Those new modes were interesting and his delegation wished to receive further information on them.                   He said that section IX of document WT/COMTD/W/104 acknowledged that there were certain regions, including the Caribbean, that were in urgent need of enhanced technical assistance and capacity building to adjust to a more open trading environment and to compete and participate more effectively in the multilateral trading system. His delegation appreciated that the Caribbean region had been accorded priority by the WTO and that it would obtain greater levels of assistance from the WTO in cooperation with other regional and international organisations. He hoped that funding for the regional three month trade policy courses would be forthcoming and sustained so that that particular programme could continue and be extended to other regions. He admitted that it was difficult to narrow his Government's requests for technical assistance in 2003 to the required limit, given his country's numerous technical assistance requirements. However, his delegation looked forward to working with the WTO and the relevant regional bodies in staging the activities that had been approved.","WTCOMTDM42.pdf","Members, Doha, Ministerial, Conference, Members, WTO, WTO, Secretariat, WTO, Caribbean, Caribbean, WTO, WTO, WTO"
"4425",4425,"32","32.      The representative of Jamaica said that his delegation welcomed the 2003 TA Plan which listed the range of activities to be conducted at the national and regional levels. The 2003 TA Plan was presented in two separate documents. Document WT/COMTD/W/104 gave an overview of the challenges faced and the Secretariat's thinking in developing the 2003 TA Plan, and document WT/COMTD/W/104/Add.1 contained the activities to be implemented. He noted from section 5 of WT/COMTD/W/104 that 118 countries had submitted a total of 1038 requests with the Singapore issues, capacity building and services being the top three priority areas. The document also stated that there had been a shift in Members' technical assistance requests to greater emphasis being placed on capacity building for trade integration and the need to address supply-side constraints. However, the focus remained on capacity building in the area of the WTO negotiations and understanding and implementing the WTO agreements. His delegation supported the increased emphasis on building what had been described as commercial infrastructure. He noted from document WT/COMTD/W/104 that while the Secretariat acknowledged that that was outside the ambit of the WTO, it would be making greater efforts to enhance coordination between the WTO and other international organisations such as the World Bank, UNIDO and UNDP with a view to meeting Members requirements in that area. His delegation had always held the view that technical assistance should not only be restricted to increase Members' awareness about the rules, but should also consider supply-side constraints which hindered production and Members' ability to compete in the global market-place. While it was obvious that the WTO would increase its efforts in that regard, it was still not clear how, operationally, the greater inter-agency co-ordination and implementation envisaged in the 2003 TA Plan would be achieved. In that context, his delegation hoped that the scope of the standards trade development facility, which Members had been informed about, would be broad enough to encompass not only the traditional technical assistance relating to the WTO agreements but to go beyond that.","WTCOMTDM42.pdf","Jamaica, Secretariat, Singapore, Members, WTO, WTO, Secretariat, WTO, WTO, World, Bank, UNIDO, UNDP, Members, Members, Members, WTO, Members, WTO"
"4424",4424,"31","31.      The representative of Bangladesh said that the 2003 TA Plan mainly focused on seminars and workshops. His delegation had repeatedly mentioned that those types of activities were neither helpful to his Government, nor LDCs in general. Only Members with expertise in WTO agreements could benefit from seminars and workshops by developing their expertise and updating their knowledge. His Government had identified its capacity building needs and realised that there was a need to develop institutional capacity. His Government could not participate effectively in WTO negotiations unless it could develop domestic institutions. It had therefore submitted technical assistance requests to the WTO with the objective of developing endogenous capacity to analyse WTO related issues. With that in mind his Government had proposed the selection of one private university and one government-owned training institute to develop capacity to run training programmes on WTO trade-related issues of interest to his Government. Those training programmes would be directed to government officials, private sector and civil society representatives. They would include the findings of recent research and analysis of WTO-related issues, particularly in areas with a bearing on ongoing negotiations and where negotiations might be required. When requested by either the government or the private sector the institutions would provide policy advice on WTO-related matters to assist the Government and the private sector representatives to implement the WTO agreements. Such assistance would include advice in the submission of periodic notifications and reports and in observing standards. As part of the 2003 TA programme, his delegation had                                                                                     WT/COMTD/M/42                                                                                            Page 15 requested assistance from the WTO to build capacity of such institutions. That included the provision of facilities such as library and a database on WTO related material, the equipment required for teaching and running courses, teaching aids and training modules on subjects of specific interests to LDCs, training of faculty and other resource personnel to fulfil the objective mentioned in paragraph 34 a-d in document WT/COMTD/W/104, i.e. training of trainers and to associate the institutions with seminars and workshops run by the WTO in Geneva, Bangladesh or its region. His delegation had requested the increased participation of candidates from Bangladesh in the Geneva-based training programmes as well as the organisation of regional seminars and workshops in Bangladesh with the participation of LDCs, in the areas of market access for agricultural and non agricultural products, services negotiations and in the area of trade and environment. His delegation had also requested the organisation of national workshops on TRIPS, WTO rules, and agriculture in association with his Government. He said that most of the needs expressed by his Government had unfortunately not been taken into account in the 2003 TA Plan. Although in the 2003 TA Plan there were three national courses for Bangladesh, as for the other LDCs, the key need of institutional building had not been included in the 2003 TA Plan. He hoped that due consideration would be given to the capacity building needs of his Government in the revised 2003 TA Plan.","WTCOMTDM42.pdf","Bangladesh, LDCs, Members, WTO, WTO, WTO, WTO, WTO, WTO, WTO, WTO, WTO, Geneva, Bangladesh, Bangladesh, Bangladesh, WTO, Bangladesh"

He would also defer any detailed comments in his capacity as coordinator of the LDC Group for a later date. He thanked the Director-General for his policy statement which had given Members the feeling that Members and the Secretariat were moving toward some sort of policy convergence in the area of technical assistance and capacity building. He believed that stating policy objectives in advance of doing something always clarified matters. His delegation had always stated that there were parts of TRTA and capacity building that the WTO Secretariat was most suited to deliver and other parts that it was not. It was good that that had been reflected in the documents. Most of the LDCs preferred a certain type of technical assistance. That was the long-term technical assistance and capacity building such as supply-side assistance, trade infrastructure creation and institution building. He recalled that there had been demand for increased cooperation between the WTO and institutions such as UNCTAD. There had also been a request for UNCTAD to be included in the sharing of resources so that it could deliver the assistance that developing countries needed and that the WTO could not supply. He sought clarification with respect to the statement in bullet point 6 on page 5, in document WT/COMTD/W/104 which read ""sixth, recipient countries have shifted priorities in their TA/CB requests "". He said that that was inaccurate as Members priorities had remained consistent. What Members had done was to reclarify their priorities with the realisation of what the WTO could offer. Another statement in bullet point 6 on page 5, read ""As an agency, the WTO cannot deliver, in this regard, except through co-ordinated arrangements with development agencies and bilateral donors, and the recipient countries themselves"". He compared that with the statement in paragraph 6 on page 6, of WT/COMTD/W/104, that read ""The challenge of the 2003 WTO Annual Plan for TA/CB is to build capacity in the beneficiary countries for effective negotiations, legal implementation of WTO Agreements, and trade integration."" He said that the first mentioned quotation stated that the WTO could not deliver ""trade integration"" and yet it was included in paragraph 6. He therefore sought clarification with respect to how the WTO Secretariat would deal with trade integration.","WTCOMTDM42.pdf","Zambia, LDC, Group, Director-General, Members, Members, Secretariat, WTO, Secretariat, WTO, UNCTAD, UNCTAD, WTO, Members, Members, WTO, WTO, WTO, WTO, WTO, WTO, Secretariat"

"4421",4421,"29","29.      He further said that he had made those points because he had been asked to chair an informal group of Members which had met over the past few months and were concerned about those issues. He had chaired three out of four meetings held. The origins of that informal group went back to the discussion that had taken place with the Canadian delegation. The group consisted of all the major developed country donors and a number of beneficiary developing countries. The WTO Secretariat had participated in a number of the discussions. The group had been seized with the need to improve the efficiency and quality of the technical assistance and capacity building programmes that had been implemented and were being implemented. The group had been concerned with the need to ensure that the 2003 TA Plan took into account the lessons and experiences of the previous years. The group had identified four issues for further discussion and with regard to which it hoped to make contributions. The first issue was how the quality of the current technical assistance programmes could be improved and how it could be ensured that the 2003 TA Plan did not suffer from the same difficulties and criticisms that the 2002 TA Plan had. The second issue was how to ensure that a simple and quick needs analysis was carried out. It did not have to be as complex as the IF diagnostic analysis but would still establish which were the needs at the country level. The third issue was how to ensure that there was real coherence notably between the multilateral agencies but also between the bilateral donors and the multilateral institutions. There had been a number of difficulties in the field where bilateral donors had tended to influence the programmes in the direction of their own polices WT/COMTD/M/42 Page 14 and strategies. That was a common concern and there was a desire to reduce that tendency and to make the WTO programme a true multilateral one, but one that still included the contribution of multilateral agencies. The fourth issue related to the need for overall guidance for the WTO TA. He said that the group was keen to discuss with the Director-General how to go forward on that issue. He concluded by saying that the next meeting of developing countries participating in the informal group was going to be coordinated by the delegation of Colombia. Both the delegations of South Africa and Canada were available to discuss any of the issues in more details with any other delegations who were interested in participating in the group.","WTCOMTDM42.pdf","Members, WTO, Secretariat, WTO, WTO, Director-General, Colombia, South, Africa, Canada"
"4420",4420,"28","28.     He continued by saying that the DDA contained a commitment to include technical assistance and capacity building as a term of the agreement to launch the new round of negotiations. Therefore, it was a significant negotiating issue that Ministers would pay a lot of attention to at the next Ministerial Conference. He said that special and differential treatment (S&D) was a key issue as developing countries had not benefited as much as they should have from the processes of globalization and because the benefits had accrued mainly to developed countries. The need for adjustment by developing countries as they continued with the process of integration was something that would cause increased burdens on already marginalized and vulnerable economies. The process by which those economies liberalised and integrated into the world economy had to be managed cautiously. It had to be carried out in a customized and properly sequenced manner. S&D was therefore important, and the way in which capacity building was managed for beneficiaries of S&D required careful discussion. He agreed with the Director-General's broad categorisation of technical assistance and capacity building. The three categories that the Director-General had suggested that Members focus on were the need to assist countries to negotiate effectively, the need to build capacity                                                                                    WT/COMTD/M/42                                                                                           Page 13 for countries to implement rules, and the need to build commercial infrastructure including supply- side support. With respect to the need to negotiate effectively, he said that while the WTO had an important role to play, it was not competent to provide the support that developing countries required. Members required assistance in three broad areas in order to negotiate effectively. First, developing countries needed to develop appropriate trade policies and strategies so that their negotiating strategy was part of a broader set of development and economic policies. Second, Members needed to develop appropriate trade and market access strategies and think about how their bilateral and regional strategies were synchronized with their multilateral strategies. He did not think that the WTO could provide the necessary assistance in that particular area. Third, a more sustainable way of developing the capacity of Members to negotiate was to build appropriate institutions to develop intra-Government cohesion and for consultations and consensus building with other stakeholders - including the private sector and NGOs. That area required more attention and competence than was available within the current mandate and portfolio of resources in the WTO. He would make some proposals regarding how to deal with those issues. He went on to say that there was a need for the WTO to take into account the need to work with other institutions on negotiating skills, on issues relating to implementation and compliance, and to commercial infrastructure and supply-side support. There had to be coherence with other multilateral institutions such as UNCTAD, ITC, and the World Bank, not only in the form of general coordination but also in terms of policy content and substance. One of the questions raised in discussions during the previous months was how Members without capacity would identify their own interests and make demands on the Secretariat. What was required was needs assessments. A deeper process was required in order to establish what developing countries needs were. He said that while the WTO Secretariat was doing a good job with its limited resources, it needed to draw on experiences gained over the years in capacity building, trade negotiations and trade policy development. He referred to the experiences of the more developed developing countries, which were not utilised in the development and implementation of WTO technical assistance programmes. He said that there was a need for some kind of advisory structure to the current WTO Secretariat on technical assistance and capacity building. Another question he wished to raise was how the WTO meaningfully could contribute to the process of implementation of WTO agreements in developing countries, particularly in those that required S&D. He asked how it could be ensured that the development objectives and strategies of those countries were in alignment with the implementation requirements of the WTO agreements and with the implementation difficulties that those countries faced. Proposals to create a monitoring mechanism had been made in that regard. A monitoring mechanism would develop appropriate capacity building programmes which would be in alignment with the implementation problems and development strategies of developing countries.","WTCOMTDM42.pdf","DDA, Director-General, Director-General, Members, WTO, Members, Members, WTO, Members, WTO, WTO, UNCTAD, ITC, World, Bank, Members, Secretariat, WTO, Secretariat, WTO, WTO, Secretariat, WTO, WTO, WTO"
"4419",4419,"27","27.      The representative of South Africa said that the 2003 Technical Assistance Plan showed that WTO TA was moving in the right direction. He expressed his appreciation for the Director-General's interest in the issue of technical assistance because it was one of the pillars of the current negotiations. He said that he would begin by making some broad contextual points before commenting in detail on the 2003 TA Plan and on some of the remarks that the Director-General had made. With respect to the broader context, he said that it was important for Members to recognise that both market access and TRTA and capacity building were among the key issues that Ministers had put on the agenda of many global conferences and committed themselves to supporting as they were critical to the development process. Those conferences included the International Conference on Financing for Development, the World Food Summit and the World Summit for Sustainable Development (WSSD). The WSSD had reaffirmed the commitment of all the leaders who were present, to the DDA with the emphasis on development. The leaders had also committed themselves to increased technical assistance and capacity building, particularly during the negotiations. While discussing the issue of capacity building, Members needed to be aware that genuine, meaningful and substantial technical assistance and capacity building was most effectively provided by genuine market access for developing countries. Genuine market access required significant and substantive changes in the trade policies of developed countries. Although those issues were being discussed in other fora of the WTO, he reminded delegations that the key issues involved were domestic support and export subsidies, some of the rules that increase protection such as trade remedies, and a number of the regulatory issues including Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures (SPS) and Technical Barriers to Trade (TBTs) which could have and had had the effect of increasing protection and increasing the barriers to developed country markets. Recent studies had highlighted the fact that those policies of developed countries had had and continued to have a negative developmental effect on developing countries and estimates of losses ranged anywhere between US$50 billion to US$100 billion per annum. That had to be kept in mind when the 2003 TA Plan was discussed.","WTCOMTDM42.pdf","South, Africa, WTO, Director-General, Director-General, Members, TRTA, WSSD, DDA, Members, WTO, SPS"
"4418",4418,"26","26.      The representative of Venezuela said that WTO's work was high priority for her Government. The presence of the Director-General at the meeting was a sign of WTO's intention to give priority to its technical assistance and training activities. Her delegation had followed the development of technical cooperation and training programmes conducted by the WTO and it had made suggestions with a view to improving those programmes and achieving efficiency. She said that her delegation was pleased that a new impulse had been given to those programmes. She commended the Secretariat for its efforts in drawing up the 2003 TA Plan. She said that the Secretariat had contacted her delegation in order to establish priorities for technical assistance and had taken on board her delegations suggestions. She noted that progress had been made with respect to collaboration with other Geneva-based organisations and hoped that it would continue. Despite those efforts there were still weaknesses in terms of implementation and efficiency in enforcing the provisions of WTO's TA programme. There was a lack of the necessary human resources as well as the fact that the Technical Cooperation Division had other internal priorities. Delegations had made efforts of communicating their priorities to the Secretariat as well as consulting with their capitals and the Technical Cooperation Division. The divisions in charge had continued to inform Members that it took long to prepare documents and that they were not in a position to carry out the activities requested by Members. That had been a bitter experience for her delegation. Her Government had spared no effort in communicating its requests. However, it had so far not received any response. Any response that would be made was bound to be negative. Efforts made towards improving the TA programme had to go hand in hand with a greater awareness in the technical divisions. The better people in her country were trained the better they would cooperate with the WTO and comply with their duties as instructed by Ministers at the Doha Ministerial Conference. The quality of TA programmes was improving. WT/COMTD/M/42 Page 12 However, her delegation was concerned with the fact that approximately 30 activities in Latin America and the Caribbean had been forfeited. On the other had, she was pleased to note that the activities conducted and planned for 2003 by the Training Institute emphasized the training of trainers programmes. She hoped that it would be possible to connect that programme with university networks. She encouraged the Secretariat to continue efforts in that direction and to improve coordination with academic institutions. Her delegation hoped that sufficient means would be given to the Training Institute in order to coordinate with other institutions as part of a high level academic network. The new programme implied new challenges and her Government had applied for 18 activities. Her delegation felt that the number of participants in each course should be increased and that pilot courses be conducted in the Latin American region. She echoed the point made by the Director-General at the High Level Segment of the UNCTAD Trade and Development Board Meeting, that technical assistance was key to improve the understanding of processes, in particular to the understanding of the consequences of negotiations for developing country Members.","WTCOMTDM42.pdf","Venezuela, WTO, Director-General, WTO, WTO, Secretariat, Secretariat, WTO, Technical, Cooperation, Division, Secretariat, Technical, Cooperation, Division, Members, Members, WTO, Doha, Ministerial, Conference, Latin, America, Caribbean, Training, Institute, Secretariat, Training, Institute, Director-General, UNCTAD, Trade, and, Development, Board, Meeting, Members"
"4417",4417,"25","25.      The representative of Haiti said that he agreed with the Director-General that technical assistance and integration into the multilateral trading system was of great importance. The 2003 TA Plan presented a list of activities to assist developing and least-developed countries to integrate further into the multilateral trading system. The Director-General had referred to issues of particular importance to his delegation, for instance quality over quantity in technical assistance delivery and the importance to be accorded to acceding countries. Haiti had been a Member of the WTO since the GATT but the Committee on Trade and Development had to attach importance to the countries in accession. It was important for the credibility of the WTO to enable the accession of LDCs. Coherence with other institutions was also important. The WTO could offer technical assistance in the form of internships, institutional capacity building, and reference centers. However, such assistance was by itself not sufficient. Supply capacities needed to be strengthened and new infrastructures were required. The WTO could not offer that service which was why coordination with other organisations such as the World Bank, IMF and regional banks was essential. He agreed with the representative of Lesotho that Members needed to do their utmost for UNIDO to participate in the discussions. He was aware that a memorandum of understanding was being elaborated between the WTO and UNIDO and he hoped that that cooperation would soon be established. The non- exhaustive list of agencies to cooperate with the WTO had to include the International Telecommunications Union (ITU). Telecommunication was important, and the ITU, which was preparing its World Summit on the Information Society, had to work hand in hand with the WTO to offer developing countries the possibility to derive benefits from the technology that was proliferating throughout the world. His delegation also wished to see the WTO establish links with the International Agency for Atomic Energy (IAEA) as it could assist in strengthening developing and least-developed country infrastructure. It could assist in strengthening those countries' capacities to use energy resources, for instance water, solar, nuclear and wind energy which were needed for those countries to develop. The Common Fund for Commodities, which had requested observer status in the CTD was another organisation of importance to Members. Members' capacities required to be strengthened to become self-sufficient in food. The Common Fund for Commodities could strengthen the WTO's position in agriculture. He said that the discussion on internships was still open and Members would see how they could use technical assistance to make progress. He was certain that many members would make contributions at the pledging conference and he thanked those members who had contributed more than expected.","WTCOMTDM42.pdf","Haiti, Director-General, Director-General, Haiti, Member, WTO, GATT, Committee, on, Trade, and, Development, WTO, WTO, WTO, World, Bank, IMF, Lesotho, Members, UNIDO, WTO, UNIDO, WTO, International, Telecommunications, Union, ITU, ITU, Information, Society, WTO, WTO, International, Agency, for, Atomic, Energy, IAEA, CTD, Members, Members, WTO, Members"
"4416",4416,"24","24.     The representative of Mauritius said that his delegation supported the statement made by the representative of Kenya on behalf of the African Group. He was pleased, as coordinator of the small and vulnerable economies Group in Geneva, to hear the comments that the Director-General had made with respect to small economies. The Director-General had said that, ""we need to be aware that there are several regional challenges to which we need to respond. Countries in these regions have needs as critical as those of the LDCs. These include countries in Africa, South and Central Asia, the Caribbean, and others."" He thanked the Director-General for recognising that the small and vulnerable economies had problems. He was pleased that the three requests that his Government had made on customs valuation, services and the Singapore issues had been included. His delegation would need more time to consider the 2003 TA Plan before commenting in detail on it. He highlighted that no mention had been made of small and vulnerable economies in the Secretariat's presentation of the ""lessons from 2002 implementation"", and he hoped that that would be considered.

"4415",4415,"23","23.      The representative of Lesotho said that his delegation shared the views that had been expressed by the Director-General. There was an urgent need for enhanced cooperation between UNCTAD and the WTO, in implementing the mandate emanating from the Doha Ministerial Conference. When considering the concentration of requests to the WTO for technical assistance, it appeared that there was a significant focus on the Singapore issues. That was where his delegation wished to see enhanced cooperation between the two institutions due to the unique experience that UNCTAD possessed in that area. He agreed with the Director-General that enhanced market access did not necessarily lead to enhanced productive and export capacity in developing and least-developed countries. There was therefore a need to focus, perhaps more than in the past, on addressing supply-side issues. He was pleased with the Director-General's referral to the need for enhanced participation of agencies such as UNIDO, which might have a comparative advantage in certain areas. He encouraged such coordination to be undertaken as soon as possible as other organisations could effectively contribute to the WTO TA programme. He said that the issue of accession was of great importance. Over the past four years the issue of accession had been on the agenda of the Sub-Committee on LDCs as well as on the agenda of the Ministerial Conferences that had been held during that time. What had been lacking were concrete steps to make the TA programmes for acceding countries effective. His delegation hoped to see a more focused and concrete approach to addressing the concerns of acceding countries, particularly LDCs. His delegation was prepared to work with the Secretariat in formulating practical approaches to that issue. He concurred with the Director-General that there was a need to improve the quality of the TA programmes undertaken by the WTO. Over the past four years his Government had been receiving technical assistance and capacity building. However, there was little difference in the content of the courses between then and at present and that pointed to a need to concentrate on the quality of the courses. The capacity in Members and observers requesting assistance was improving and there had to be a parallel process to enhance the quality of the assistance provided. The WTO had to appreciate that countries had moved forward from where they were four years ago. Rehearsing trade policy principles was not in line with the unfolding agenda that Members were faced with in the WTO. There had to be a process of continuously upgrading the content of the courses. He agreed with the Director-General that strategic partnerships were critical, and his delegation encouraged the Secretariat to work towards establishing more strategic partnerships with regional institutions and other multilateral agencies as a way of ensuring that Members programmes were fully supported and in line with processes in other institutions. He concluded by saying that his delegation was of the view that the 2003 TA Plan should not be directed towards the Cancun Ministerial Conference but should be a long-term plan that was sustainable and that delivered long lasting results. The 2003 TA Plan needed to take into account and support other dynamics that were taking place at the national and regional levels in order to be effective. His delegation needed more time to consider the 2003 TA Plan as well as the figures that had been presented by DDG Abbot to see whether those figures would be supportive of what his delegation felt was a priority in the 2003 TA Plan.","WTCOMTDM42.pdf","Lesotho, Director-General, UNCTAD, WTO, Doha, Ministerial, Conference, WTO, Singapore, UNCTAD, Director-General, Director-General, UNIDO, WTO, Secretariat, Director-General, WTO, Members, WTO, Members, WTO, Director-General, Secretariat, Members"
"4414",4414,"22","22.      The representative of Kenya said that, on behalf of the African Group he was pleased to hear that technical assistance was one of the four priority areas that the Director-General had identified in his administration, and that WTO comparative advantage would be applied in building the required technical assistance. The African group was also pleased that the Director-General would seek increased collaboration with other inter-governmental organisations and bilateral donors. He noted with appreciation that there was going to be a focus on commercial infrastructure, which would address the issue of supply-side constraints. The African Group looked forward to studying the new products introduced to the 2003 TA Plan in the attempt of addressing the DDA. He agreed that Members needed to focus on the quality rather than the quantity of technical assistance. That would ensure that the Members received the right products to meet their needs. The JITAP could be one of the programmes that could be emulated and extended to other African countries. His delegation needed time to study the document in order to see how it related to the needs of African countries. However, it seemed to address some of the areas that his delegation had requested and he welcomed the new products proposed. He disagreed with the Secretariat with respect to the duration of courses. Shorter courses had proved to be more expensive than the longer ones and the long courses were more comprehensive and addressed the actual needs of the beneficiary countries. He was pleased to hear that the regional courses held in Nairobi and Casablanca were undergoing evaluation. His delegation believed that those two courses had proved their usefulness, and many of the participants interviewed in Nairobi had confirmed that that was the type of technical assistance that addressed their Governments' needs. He hoped that the Secretariat would view those courses from that angle. Those WT/COMTD/M/42 Page 10 courses should have been included in the list of activities for 2003 for planning purposes. It was easier to strike off figures than to add the same figures after the budget process was completed.","WTCOMTDM42.pdf","Kenya, African, Group, Director-General, WTO, Director-General, African, Group, DDA, Members, Members, Secretariat, Nairobi, Casablanca, Nairobi, Secretariat"
"4413",4413,"21","21.     He continued by saying that the planned volume of technical assistance in 2003 was more or less the same as in 2002, and the number of planned regional activities would also remain approximately the same. However, the cost estimates were significantly higher than the estimated                                                                                    WT/COMTD/M/42                                                                                            Page 9 cost of the WTO technical assistance and training activities planned for 2002. There were several reasons for that. First, the 2003 TA Plan included a significant number of activities to be held at WTO headquarters to which more capital-based officials would be invited. In 2002, such activities had been restricted for the most part to Geneva-based delegates. Inviting capital-based officials had the benefit of spreading information and enhancing capacity in the national administrations in capitals after the end of the activity. Including overheads, that accounted for approximately CHF 10 million of the increase to the cost estimates. In 2002, it had initially been proposed that the ""L posts"" be financed out of the Programme Support Fund, and some of them had been financed in that way. However, two-thirds of them had to be financed through the Global Trust Fund. 2002 was not a full year because the staff had to be recruited and had only taken up their posts in the second part of 2002. Having a full year in 2003, the costs of the same posts would be larger than in 2002. Airfares had increased significantly in 2002 following the 11 September 2001 events while the estimates for 2002 had been based on 2001 average costs before 11 September. The Secretariat often had to organise activities in upper-market hotels, in the absence of decent cheaper alternatives to ensure adequate conference facilities. Those hotels would regularly charge more for a night than the total UN per diem for the country hosting the activity. As customers the WTO could not control those elements. The anticipated average number of participants in regional activities was expected to be 20 per cent higher in 2003 compared to 2002. While it was clear that WTO Members could not influence all elements of the increased costs, any adjustment to the 2003 TA Plan which might result from the discussions in the CTD would influence the cost estimates. The cost estimates presented did not contain any provision for the repetition of the courses held in Casablanca and Nairobi, pending the evaluation of those first two pilot three-month trade policy courses. If the evaluation was positive and the courses were to be repeated, then the Secretariat would make the necessary cost estimates and provide them as an addendum. Those courses might then not only be repeated, but as requested by the Director-General, they might include a greater number of participants. Members' views with respect to those courses were welcome. He concluded by saying that, at the first pledging conference held on 11 March 2002, Members had pledged CHF 5 million for 2003. The Secretariat anticipated that the DDAGTF would show a positive balance at the end of the year. The actual size of the surplus would depend on the receipt of the remaining contributions pledged for 2002. The Secretariat hoped that pledges to the DDAGTF for 2003 would amount to CHF 36.5 million, from which should be subtracted the pledges that had been made and any balance left from 2002. Although the figure was high, technical assistance was crucial to the DDA and many Members attached high importance to it.","WTCOMTDM42.pdf","WTO, WTO, Global, Trust, Fund, Secretariat, UN, WTO, WTO, Members, CTD, Casablanca, Nairobi, Secretariat, Director-General, Members, Members, Secretariat, Secretariat, DDA, Members"
"4412",4412,"20","20.      He further said that the cost estimates he was going to present to Members would be fully adjusted to reflect the results of Members' discussions. Members had received document CRP(02)/3 containing the financial implications of the 2003 TA Plan. For costing purposes, the 441 activities covered by the 2003 TA Plan had been regrouped into three categories: the Geneva-based activities, regional activities and national activities. Geneva-based activities were held at the WTO headquarters and would involve either Geneva-based delegates or a mixture of Geneva-based and capital-based officials, as well as some outside speakers. Geneva-based activities for capital-based delegates were something the Secretariat wished to do more of, but they were costly as participants travelling costs had to be financed. Regional activities involved several WTO Members or observers and also involved the financing, travelling and subsistence costs for the participants. The national activities took place in a given country and required the financing of WTO staff members’ travel. Globally, the Secretariat had arrived at a figure for those 2003 activities of between CHF 30 and 31 million. The total comprised of three elements. First, the total estimate for activities was CHF 35,571,750. Second, a reduction on that expected from cost sharing arrangements with individual countries and other organisations was expected to amount to CHF 5,073,755. That resulted in a net total of between CHF 30 and 31 million. In arriving at those figures, the Secretariat had applied standard cost methodologies assigning different standard costs for a one day activity for one person depending upon whether the event was classed as a national activity (CHF 1,850), a regional activity (CHF 1,150), or an activity in Geneva headquarters (CHF 2,700). Some of the figures had increased and others decreased from the previous year, and he would explain the reasons. Three additional elements had been identified and their costs had been estimated in order to arrive at the total cost of the package. The first was the future activities of the WTO Training Institute that were not covered by the regular budget. Those amounted to CHF 180,000, which was less than in 2002. The second element was the project posts funded through extra budgetary funds, also known as ""L posts"". Those were not financed by the Programme Support Fund. The ""L posts"" were temporary assistance posts, which did not tend to be temporary. Financing them amounted to CHF 2,475,470. The third element related to the overheads, which was a standard way of covering administration costs and was a function of the total. Those overheads were 13% of all direct costs and amounted to CHF 4,309,950. The consolidated total was CHF 37,463,415. However, Members were expected to contribute CHF 36,500,00 as there were some funds left over from the previous year.","WTCOMTDM42.pdf","Members, Members, Members, WTO, Secretariat, WTO, Members, WTO, Secretariat, Secretariat, Geneva, WTO, Training, Institute, Members"

"4410",4410,"19","19.      DDG Mr. Abbot said that he had been asked to provide an overview of the Secretariat's cost estimates for the proposed WTO technical assistance and training activities for 2003. He made it clear that he was not making any judgement as to whether Members should be spending more or less money on technical assistance. Members had the right to accept, reject or modify the 2003 TA Plan according to their wishes. His mission was to tell Members what the 2003 TA Plan would cost. Adjustments to the cost estimates would have to be made if Members made changes to the 2003 TA Plan. In other words, he would provide information as to what a pledging conference would have to deliver if the Secretariat was to execute the draft 2003 TA Plan. He hoped that the figures he was going to present to Members, taken together with the details provided in the documents related to the Coordinated WTO Secretariat Annual Technical Assistance Plan for 2003 (WT/COMTD/W/104, WT/COMTD/W/104/Add.1) and to the activities of the WTO Training Institute in 2003 (WT/COMTD/W/103) would provide Members with the basic information they required to prepare their authorities' positions in advance of a pledging conference for the Doha Development Agenda Global Trust Fund (DDAGTF) that might be held later in 2002. The problems associated with the creation of the DDAGTF in the previous year were an element of the past. The Committee on Budget, Finance and Administration (BFA) would take the results of the discussions in the CTD into consideration later in the year. Adjustments would be made to the financing, if necessary, and the Committee on BFA would then make a recommendation to the General Council on a target amount for the 2003 DDAGTF.","WTCOMTDM42.pdf","Abbot, Secretariat, WTO, Members, Members, Members, Members, Secretariat, Members, WTO, Secretariat, WTO, Training, Institute, Members, Doha, Development, Agenda, Global, Trust, Fund, Committee, on, Budget, ,, Finance, and, Administration, BFA, CTD, Committee, BFA, General, Council"

"4408",4408,"17","17.      He further spoke about a point that had been made clear in the priorities communicated by Members, and that was the need for a higher training component in the technical assistance activities. When communicating their training priorities, many Members had pointed out that they preferred training courses of a one to three-week duration rather than longer courses because of the limited human resources some ministries possessed. In order to respond to the need for institutional capacity building with the focus on courses of short-term duration, the Secretariat had included 77 training courses of short-term duration for 2003. That was the largest number ever included in a technical assistance plan. The two 12-week regional trade policy courses in Nairobi and Casablanca were being evaluated by the WTO TA Audit. The Secretariat would issue a report concerning its future policy and funding proposals in that area after the completion of the evaluation. He concluded by mentioning the lessons learnt when drawing up the 2003 TA Plan. Demand was greater than supply. The Secretariat therefore had a duty to sort and rationalise the requests. Recipient countries were calling for more emphasis on trade integration, referring to the type of technical assistance that had been mentioned by the Director-General, that was TA to build infrastructure. The Secretariat had learnt that all activities would come to nothing in the recipient countries if technical assistance was not an integral part of the overall development strategy's of the country or of its Poverty Reduction Strategy Papers (PRSP) as appropriate. The former lesson that co-ordination challenges remained acute had been reinforced. The Director-General had recommitted himself to that and it would be tackled in co-ordination with recipients and donors. Strategic partnerships and synergies were indispensable and the Director-General would pursue them both within the JITAP, a key area of synergy, and the IF. The Bretton Woods Institutions, the World Bank and the IMF, were important and without them little would be achieved. He reiterated the point made by the Director-General that there were principle challenges in Africa, South and Central Asia, the Caribbean, LDCs and acceding countries. There was a need to accelerate the implementation of the IF and Members needed to be aware that the Secretariat was dealing with the issue of ad hoc activities. He said that Members had asked the Secretariat to ensure that technical assistance and market access were complimentary, not substitutes. With respect to principles, he reconfirmed that the 2003 TA Plan had been designed on the basis of recipient-determined priorities. The Secretariat had sorted and rationalised the requests to something manageable. It had not proceeded on a strictly demand driven path, because if it had there would be 1038 activities in the 2003 TA Plan.","WTCOMTDM42.pdf","Members, Members, Secretariat, Nairobi, Casablanca, WTO, TA, Audit, Secretariat, Secretariat, Director-General, Secretariat, Director-General, Director-General, World, Bank, IMF, Director-General, Africa, Central, Asia, Caribbean, LDCs, Members, Secretariat, Members, Secretariat, Secretariat"
"4407",4407,"16","16.       He continued by saying that the Training Institute, the Technical Cooperation Division and the Statistics Division had developed a comprehensive tool kit for trade negotiators. The Secretariat hoped to present it before the end of October 2002. The tool kit would enable Members to manipulate tariffs in the Integrated Database and the Consolidated Tariffs Schedule (CTS). Members would also be able to perform their own analyses of textural proposals that other Members had put forward. That had been achieved through funding assistance from the Department for International Development (DFID) of the United Kingdom and in cooperation with the Inter-American Development Bank and the Secretariat for Economic Integration of Central America (SIECA) that had done previous work in the area. The Secretariat had finally realised how to structure internships. Internships were high quality and high cost capacity building. There were four types of internships. The first was the regular internships where interns were recruited directly by Divisions. The second was the ""Dutch internship system"" where the intern was employed as WTO staff for a two-year period but was prevented from staying on to work in the Secretariat beyond that period. The intern had to return and support the administration in their country. The third and new internship programme, which would begin in January 2003, was the system of interns for regional co-ordinators. The intern would be designated by the regional group and paid by the Secretariat. There would be seven ""regional"" interns on a six-month rotating basis. The intern would be based with their missions in Geneva and would                                                                                     WT/COMTD/M/42                                                                                             Page 7 cover WTO meetings. The final type of internship followed the regional co-ordinators internship model. Several donors including Japan and the United Kingdom had offered resources to enable the Secretariat to offer internships to about 14 Members over the following months. They included capacity constrained developing countries, LDCs as well as low income transition economies. There was a DDA global training course. Another vital TA product for 2003, which would be subject to a separate presentation to Members, was the regional seminars which the Secretariat would conduct configured around the more than 120 existing reference centers which were the most successful of the WTO's technical assistance activities. Those seminars would include the training of representatives from both collaborating academic institutions, and finance and commerce ministries in order to continue to seek the mainstreaming objective. The programme would be circulated to Members for comments before being implemented in March 2003. He continued by saying that in the previous week, the Director-General of the WTO and the President of the World Bank, Mr. Wolfensohn had launched a standards trade development facility to which the World Bank had already contributed US$300 000 out of its development grant facility, which would be increased in 2003. The Secretariat was proposing, in the 2003 TA Plan, that the WTO make a complimentary contribution of CHF 100 000. It would be a joint World Bank and WTO facility in collaboration with the three major standardising institutions to address the significant problem with regard to the export quality and standards of products exported from developing and least-developed countries. Mr. Wolter, Director of the Agriculture and Commodities Division, and Mrs. Gretchen Stanton were to speak on that at a meeting to be arranged. That was the sum of the new products.","WTCOMTDM42.pdf","Training, Institute, Technical, Cooperation, Division, Statistics, Division, Secretariat, Members, Integrated, Database, Members, Members, Department, for, International, Development, DFID, United, Kingdom, Inter-American, Development, Bank, Secretariat, for, Economic, Integration, of, Central, America, Secretariat, WTO, Secretariat, Secretariat, Geneva, WTO, Japan, United, Kingdom, Secretariat, Members, DDA, Members, Secretariat, WTO, Members, Director-General, WTO, World, Bank, Wolfensohn, World, Bank, Secretariat, WTO, World, Bank, WTO, Wolter, Director, Agriculture, and, Commodities, Division, Gretchen, Stanton"
"4406",4406,"15","15.      He went on to say that the 2003 TA Plan focused on three objectives. One was that the Secretariat sought to deliver technical assistance to build capacity for effective participation in negotiations. That was an area in which the WTO Secretariat had competence and he was confident that it could deliver that assistance. New products had been designed and arrangements had been set up which would be confirmed in the Director-General's report required by paragraph 41 of the Doha Ministerial Declaration. The second objective was technical assistance to build capacity for implementing WTO agreements. It was an area where the WTO would be delivering technical assistance in cooperation with others. For instance, in the area of standards the WTO would WT/COMTD/M/42 Page 6 collaborate with international standardising bodies and in the area of customs valuation and trade facilitation with the World Customs Organisation, UNCTAD and the International Trade Centre (ITC). The third objective was technical assistance for trade integration and commercial infrastructure an area where the Secretariat felt unable to deliver technical assistance. However, as had been mentioned by the Director-General, the WTO would pursue co-ordination with development agencies, such as the UNDP, the World Bank, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), UNCTAD and several other organisations. The Secretariat would deliver 441 activities of which 251 would be national activities directly linked to 190 specialized regional activities within the 2003 TA Plan. Where Members had made requests but the Secretariat was unable to organize national activities due to a variety of reasons they would be able to benefit from regional programmes. When considering the 2003 TA Plan he urged Members to look at the national activities from which they would also benefit, in conjunction with the regional activities from which they would benefit. They were inseparable. The second axis of the Plan was that a formal channel of communication had been established with the Development Assistance Committee (DAC) of the OECD to relate to several bilateral donors who had set aside resources and made logistic arrangements to deliver technical assistance complimentary to that of the WTO. Many bilateral donors were in contact with the Secretariat in order to reinforce the Secretariat's work by filling the gaps with regard to the priorities communicated by Members. That was integral to the 2003 TA Plan. There was inter-agency coordination following consultations the WTO Secretariat had had with the World Bank. The World Bank lead the process in coherence and co-ordination with other agencies. The WTO Secretariat had established a first understanding with regional development banks which in many respects were twice as large as the WTO Secretariat and possessed more resources. The regional development banks had confirmed co-sharing arrangements by which they would be financing and providing logistic support for a lot of the technical assistance that was to be delivered. The WTO Secretariat was grateful to the six major regional development banks and was beginning to benefit from its cooperation with them. A key part which would add value to the 2003 TA Plan was the idea of trade clinics that had been introduced by the Director-General. The Director-General had been concerned that a plan might be unable to relate and respond rapidly to Members that had difficulties in a variety of areas, for instance in implementing their obligations within transitional time frames, with respect to institutional capacity-building, and domestic legislation. The trade clinics involved specialised teams of WTO resource persons responding quickly to specific trade-related problems of beneficiary countries. That would help to decrease acute implementation related problems for example. Finally, there was the Doha Development Agenda Management Database, which would be critical to the management of the range of demands coming from Members in relation to what the Secretariat could deliver alone and with regard to assistance that the Secretariat needed to deliver in co-ordination and coherence with other agencies.","WTCOMTDM42.pdf","Secretariat, WTO, Secretariat, Director-General, WTO, WTO, WTO, World, Customs, Organisation, UNCTAD, International, Trade, Centre, ITC, Secretariat, Director-General, WTO, UNDP, World, Bank, Organisation, for, Economic, Co-operation, OECD, UNCTAD, Secretariat, Members, Secretariat, Members, Development, Assistance, Committee, OECD, WTO, Secretariat, Secretariat, Members, WTO, Secretariat, World, Bank, World, Bank, WTO, Secretariat, WTO, Secretariat, WTO, Secretariat, Director-General, Director-General, Members, WTO, Doha, Development, Agenda, Management, Database, Members, Secretariat, Secretariat"
"4405",4405,"14","14.      Mr. Osakwe, Director, Technical Cooperation Division, began by apologising for the late circulation of the 2003 TA Plan. He said that what he would cover, would build on the over-arching points made by the Director-General. First, he would discuss the process of the 2003 TA Plan, the features of Members' requests and the design of the 2003 TA Plan. He would then go on to mention the lessons drawn from the delivery of the 2002 TA Plan as well as the principles applied to the 2003 TA Plan which had been slightly modified from those applied in previous years. Finally, he would deal with the issue of internal Secretariat co-ordination. He said that the Secretariat had paid attention to process because there had been criticism that the Secretariat was insensitive, that it did not pay enough attention to the priorities communicated by Members and that WTO technical assistance was Secretariat supply-side driven. To address that problem, the Secretariat had entered into formal communication with Members over a five-month period to obtain prioritised requests of individual discrete TA activities. He recalled that the Secretariat had made the first call for inputs for the 2003 TA Plan in the CTD in April. That initial call had been followed by several reminders through Committee Chairpersons. In addition, the Director-General had issued a letter on 28 June 2002 to all trade ministers with a copy to all development ministers requesting their communication of TA priorities. Every request received had been acknowledged and the Secretariat had contacted all of the 118 Members and Observers that had communicated requests. 1038 requests had been received from 118 Members and Observers. Of those requests, 613 were from 66 developing countries, 227 were from 25 LDCs and 198 of them were from 27 acceding countries. All the requests had been filed in a database which was open to verification by Members. The greatest demand for technical assistance related to the Singapore issues followed by capacity building issues. The capacity building issues encompassed one-week short trade policy courses at the national level, regional short trade policy courses of a two week duration, internships within the WTO Secretariat and other elements. Other areas in which TA was highly demanded included services, rules and agriculture.","WTCOMTDM42.pdf","Osakwe, Director, Director-General, Members, Secretariat, Secretariat, Secretariat, Members, WTO, Secretariat, Secretariat, Members, Secretariat, CTD, Committee, Chairpersons, Director-General, Secretariat, Members, Members, Members, Singapore, WTO, Secretariat"
"4404",4404,"13","13.      He went on to assure Members that the Secretariat's technical assistance objectives were not only focused on the next WTO Ministerial Conference in Cancun. His objective as Director-General was to establish an architecture of WTO technical assistance that would last beyond the Cancun Ministerial Conference and the DDA negotiations. He believed that the process had begun well and with Members' support the objective would be achieved. What the Secretariat needed to do was to consolidate and improve what it was doing, refine technical assistance and training materials, and achieve sustainability and cumulation. He concluded by assuring Members that, together with senior management, he would work to ensure improved coordination within the Secretariat, using the Technical Assistance Management Committee, to address the incidence of problems such as ad hoc activities, and improve the implementation and delivery of technical assistance. In that regard, the support of technical assistance recipients would be required. His report, as mandated by Ministers under paragraph 41 of the Doha Ministerial Declaration, would be circulated to the membership by mid-November. Indications showed that the Secretariat was on track to effectively respond to the technical cooperation and capacity building commitments in the Doha Ministerial Declaration. The remaining months would give the Secretariat time to catch up on the work. He expressed his appreciation to the donors for establishing predictability in the WTO technical assistance funding. He also thanked the recipient countries for the clarity of their priorities, which laid the basis for a significantly improved 2003 TA Plan. He invited Mr. Osakwe, Director of the Technical Cooperation Division, to present the process for compiling the 2003 TA Plan, the main features of the requests and the key elements of the 2003 TA Plan.","WTCOMTDM42.pdf","Members, Secretariat, WTO, Cancun, Director-General, WTO, Cancun, Ministerial, Conference, DDA, Members, Secretariat, Members, Secretariat, Technical, Assistance, Management, Committee, Secretariat, Secretariat, WTO, Osakwe, Director, Technical, Cooperation, Division"
"4403",4403,"12","12.      His fifth point was that he agreed with Members that priority should be accorded to the quality, not the quantity, of the technical assistance activities. Consequently, the number of discrete activities was being reduced to improve quality and increase the coverage of each. There was a tighter linkage between national and regional activities. Mr. Rolian, Director, Technical Cooperation Audit had developed new tools and processes for evaluating WTO technical assistance and training activities. In the course of the implementation of the annual technical assistance plans, Mr. Rolian would provide periodic reports to the Membership. The sixth point, and perhaps the greatest challenge was the demand for result-oriented coordination with other agencies, bilateral donors and coordination within recipient countries. There was a need to proceed with coordination and coherence with a sense of urgency. The process of building strategic partnerships and building synergies with agencies, donors and recipients needed to continue. There had been modest progress, but more needed to be done. The Joint Integrated Technical Assistance Programme (JITAP) review had yielded important insights. That success should be built upon. The Integrated Framework (IF) was the hope for medium to long-term trade development. Modest successes had been achieved in countries like Cambodia. In addition to the three pilot countries, the IF was being extended to 11 more LDCs. That extension was being closely reviewed, and he was in consultation with several Members, such as H.E. Mr. Ould Mohamed Lemine, Ambassador of Mauritania, to examine current challenges and determine how best to address those challenges. He said that concerns had been expressed with respect to the IF programme and he was doing his best to consult with both recipient and donor countries. The Heads of IF Agencies had agreed to meet in 2003 to address several issues. The speed of implementation of the IF needed to be accelerated if it was to remain relevant. The follow-up on the results of the diagnostic trade integration studies had to be taken more seriously and be based on clear procedures. He said that he would report to the Membership on that in the near future. The support of development agencies and bilateral donors was critical if the IF was to work as designed.

That document set out a series of questions for Members' consideration relating to the practical implications of building transparency into government procurement systems.

"4399",4399,"113","113.     The representative of Croatia said that he was making the statement on behalf of the Governments of Croatia, Lithuania and Moldova. Those Governments wished to thank the Secretariat for its report on the WTO Ministerial Trade Conference for Central and Southeast Europe held in Zagreb, Croatia, on 11 and 12 June 2002, contained in the document WT/COMTD/41 of 11 September 2002. He also thanked the WTO Secretariat for the preparation and organization of that important and useful event. His delegation had carefully read the Secretariat report, which was useful and contained accurate information reflecting in general the discussions held during the Conference. He had also noted the clarification that the report had been prepared under the Secretariat's own responsibility, and was without prejudice to the positions of Members or to their rights and obligations under the WTO. In that respect, the delegations he represented stressed that without having any intention to comment on the content of the report, they felt it necessary to highlight a specific issue that had not been included in the Report, but which was of significant importance to their Governments. That point had been raised and emphasized by the representatives of the three Governments in practically all session of the conference in Zagreb and particularly in the session related to the DDA negotiation round. It related to their Governments respective approaches and positions in the current negotiating round, which were strongly influenced by the fact that they had only recently acceded to the WTO. In that process, they had made extensive market-access commitments, which had been recognized in paragraph 9 of the Doha Ministerial Declaration. They therefore believed that that fact should be seriously taken into account and be adequately reflected in the DDA negotiations, including in different modalities for future market-access commitments. They had, together with a number of other Members, consistently raised that issue in other bodies. However, as the WTO Ministerial Conference held in Zagreb was an activity organized under a programme that fell within the competence of the CTD, they felt it necessary to state for the record that that specific issue had also been strongly emphasized in the Conference by senior high-level officials of their Governments.

"4396",4396,"110","110.     The representative of the European Communities said that he supported the proposal by the Chairman as it was important that the Committee had the results of the discussions in the Sub- Committee on LDCs as well as the continued discussions on the 2003 TA Plan before it before finalizing the report. He was concerned that there might not be enough time for a discussion of the draft Annual Report of the CTD on 11 November.","WTCOMTDM42.pdf","European, Communities, Chairman, Committee, Sub, -, Committee, CTD"
"4395",4395,"11","11.      Second, he continued by saying that the LDCs would continue to receive focus in WTO's Technical Assistance Plans. The 2003 TA Plan proposed several new products to take account of the LDC's needs. At the same time, it had to be kept in mind that there were several regional challenges to which the WTO needed to respond. Other countries in developing country regions had needs as critical as those of the LDCs. Such regions included countries in Africa, South and Central Asia, and the Caribbean. The Doha Ministerial Declaration established a Work Programme on Small Economies and there were capacity constrained missions in Central Asia and Eastern Europe and the transition economies. Those were all challenges and priorities that the WTO had endeavoured to respond to in the 2003 TA Plan and the Secretariat would attempt to continue to improve its activities in those areas. Third, to achieve universality of the organization, there was a need to attach priority attention to acceding countries. The 2003 TA Plan addressed acceding country technical assistance priorities and it was in that context that the Secretariat would focus on the LDCs' Work Programme. Mr. Molander, Ambassador of Sweden and Chairman of the Sub-Committee on LDCs, was working hard in that regard and had the full support of the Secretariat. Fourth, based on consultations that he had held, he realised that recipients of technical assistance attached great importance to systematic, cumulative and sustainable capacity building. In that regard, a significant improvement had been made in the 2003 TA Plan. New products had been designed to reflect Members' needs including intensive short trade policy courses, training of senior government officials on the areas of negotiations within the DDA stemming from the Doha Ministerial Conference, consolidation and extension of the internship system and training-of-trainers programmes. The work of the Technical Cooperation Division, the Training Institute and the Trade Policy Review Division, which had a high technical assistance component, had been properly interfaced and he would continue to work on the improvement of that interfacing.","WTCOMTDM42.pdf","LDCs, WTO, LDC, WTO, Africa, Central, Asia, Caribbean, Central, Asia, Eastern, Europe, WTO, Secretariat, Secretariat, Work, Programme, Molander, Ambassador, Sweden, Chairman, Secretariat, Members, DDA, Technical, Cooperation, Division, Training, Institute, Trade, Policy, Review, Division"

Furthermore, the Sub-Committee on LDCs had scheduled a Meeting for 7th November, and Members might wish to await the outcome of that Meeting before finalizing the Annual Report of the CTD. It had already been agreed that the Committee meet again to discuss the Technical Assistance Plan for 2003 on 11 November 2002. The Committee could possibly discuss the Draft report at that meeting, if time permitted. He said that he wished to provide Members with the opportunity to inform him of any particular item they might wish to include in the CTD Annual Report or to discuss any aspect of a possible Report.","WTCOMTDM42.pdf","Chairman, CTD, Members, CTD, Committee, Committee, Members, CTD"

"4384",4384,"10","10.      The Director-General, Dr. Supachai, said that technical assistance was important and was one of the four pillars that he had established for his work as Director-General of the WTO. He had taken that decision knowing the vital importance that effective trade-related technical assistance (TRTA) and capacity building played in trade development. DDG Dr. Rana would supervise the area of technical assistance and capacity building. However he, as Director-General, would personally continue to stay in touch with the topic and conduct his own consultations and deliberations on it. The 2003 TA Plan was a key element in his evolving thoughts on the subject of technical assistance and capacity building and it was based in part on consultations with Members on how WTO technical assistance could be better structured to meet present priorities and future challenges. He said he would share several points influencing his thoughts on technical assistance after which the Director of the Technical Cooperation Division, Mr. Osakwe would present the details of the Plan. First, what Members needed to develop up front was a clear strategic sense of the areas of WTO's technical assistance and capacity building. One question was where WTO's comparative advantage could best be applied. The Secretariat could not perform its duties in areas where it did not possess the full expertise or lacked the resources to do so. He believed that the skills of the Secretariat staff would be best utilised in delivering technical assistance to build effective capacity for trade negotiations. However, as that was not the totality of all technical assistance, there was a need to coordinate WTO's skills with those of other relevant multilateral agencies to deliver technical assistance for the understanding of the rules and their implementation. In that regard, he placed high premium on collaboration with UNCTAD, the International Trade Centre (ITC), the UNDP, the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the World Customs Organization (WCO), the International Standardizing Bodies, and others. Another key element was technical assistance for the construction of commercial infrastructure, which would enable developing and least-developed countries (LDCs) to draw on the benefits of improved market access and the open, rules-based trading system. After Members had agreed on certain market access measures it was not automatic that poor countries, especially the LDCs would be able to make use of the opportunities offered to them. There was therefore a need to build commercial infrastructure. The WTO had to seek coordination with other development institutions such as the World Bank, the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and the United Nations Industrial Development Organisation (UNIDO) in that area. The Secretariat would principally focus on what it did best, which was to provide technical assistance to WT/COMTD/M/42 Page 4 build effective capacity for negotiations. The Secretariat would continue to coordinate the various phases of technical assistance that went beyond the Doha Development Agenda (DDA) period of negotiations.","WTCOMTDM42.pdf","Director-General, Supachai, Director-General, WTO, Rana, Director-General, Members, WTO, Director, Technical, Cooperation, Division, Osakwe, Members, WTO, WTO, Secretariat, Secretariat, WTO, UNCTAD, International, Trade, Centre, ITC, UNDP, World, Bank, International, Monetary, Fund, IMF, World, Customs, Organization, WCO, International, Standardizing, Bodies, Members, WTO, World, Bank, United, Nations, Development, Programme, UNDP, United, Nations, Industrial, Development, Organisation, UNIDO, Secretariat, Secretariat, Doha, Development, Agenda, DDA"

"4369",4369,"99","99.     The representative of Sri Lanka said that the question posed by the representative of India had not been completely answered. The representative of India had asked how the ceiling quotas for industrial products would be allocated. She assumed that, within the quota, the preferential duty would be applicable so that once the quota was exceeded the normal rate of duty would be applicable. That was why there was a GSP ceiling. However, there were different ways to allocate that quota. It could be allocated on a first come first served basis, which meant that the country which exported first would fill the quota or it could be allocated by reserving country quotas. She sought clarification from the delegation of Japan as to whether the Government of Japan allocated what she assumed was a global quota on a first come first served basis or whether each beneficiary country had a quota which was determined based on the country's export performance during previous years. Her delegation did not expect those questions to be responded to at that meeting but wished to get further information at a subsequent meeting.","WTCOMTDM41.pdf","Sri, Lanka, India, India, GSP, Japan, Japan"

"4367",4367,"97","97.     The representative of India said that the delegation of Japan had clarified that the main annex to the notification (WT/COMTD/N/2/Add.11), on pages 2 to 5 related to the GSP Scheme which was applicable to all developing countries. He asked how that could be referred to the Sub-Committee on LDCs. He thought that the last page of the annex in WT/COMTD/N/2/Add.11, which dealt with just one item and the fact that Senegal had been added to the list of LDCs would go to the Sub-Committee on LDCs, and not the entire notification.","WTCOMTDM41.pdf","India, Japan, Senegal"

He was not certain what kind of change the delegation of Sri Lanka would have expected and what problem it had with the existing rules of origin.","WTCOMTDM41.pdf","Switzerland, Sri, Lanka"
"4364",4364,"94","94.      The representative of Japan said, with respect to the representative of Sri Lanka's question, that his delegation's notification did not include any change with respect to the criteria for deciding rules of origin. In response to the delegation of India's question, he said that Table 2 on page 6 of WT/COMTD/N/2/Add.11 related to the allocation of ceiling quotas for industrial products for Fiscal Year 2002 for LDCs. However, the ceiling quotas for industrial products were not limited to the Japanese GSP Scheme for LDCs, it was a GSP Scheme for the developing countries in general.","WTCOMTDM41.pdf","Japan, Sri, Lanka, India"

The representative of Sri Lanka sought clarification from both the delegations of Japan and Switzerland with respect to whether their revised GSP schemes contained more flexible rules of origin criteria in order to give more favourable treatment to LDCs. She asked whether the rules of origin criteria which prevailed with the Swiss 1997 GSP Scheme and the Japanese scheme remained as they were, or whether flexibility had been added to the criteria.","WTCOMTDM41.pdf","Sri, Lanka, Japan, Switzerland, GSP"

"4359",4359,"9","9.       Mr. McMillan, chairman of the Committee on Budget, Finance and Administration, said that he would report on funds received against the Doha Development Agenda Global Trust Fund (DDAGTF). He recalled that the General Council on 19 and 20 December had approved the terms of reference for the DDAGTF which were contained in the report of the BFA (WT/BFA/56). In particular, the General Council had approved a target at that point of CHF15 million for the Trust Fund for the year 2002. That target was phased in three steps. First, there was a target of 25 per cent of that funding ,about CHF3.75 million, to be deposited in the WTO bank account by the end of 2001. The second milestone of 75 per cent, or CHF11.25 million, should have been met in March 2002. At the end of June the full amount of CHF15 million should have been received. He said that the BFA also had created a buffer account of a further CHF1 million out of the 2000 surplus account to cover temporary shortfalls in the Trust Fund in case the contributions did not keep pace with the expenses of the various activities. Since then the CTD had approved the Coordinated Annual Technical Assistance Plan for 2002. The Secretariat had estimated in that Plan a total cost of CHF17.3 million after the deduction of an ambitious amount of cost sharing of CHF5 million with other institutions, including UNCTAD and a number of regional development banks. The Pledging Conference held on 11 March had produced an unprecedented level of pledges from Members.1 Donors had announced pledges totalling CHF21.3 million to the DDAGTF for 2002 and a further CHF 4 million of related funding earmarked to specific objectives. He said because that had been put in place almost three months into 2002, it had taken the BFA a little time to deliver on its commitments. Since the last time he had reported to the CTD on 25 April 2002, the situation had dramatically improved and the June         1             The precise figures were available in document WT/BFA/SPEC/77 which had been distributed to the CTD. WT/COMTD/M/41 Page 4 deadline had almost been met. Document WT/BFA/SPEC/77 showed that the WTO had received a total of CHF14.7 million by 25 June. That change over the last three months was highly encouraging. He thanked all donors that had helped meet that target.","WTCOMTDM41.pdf","McMillan, chairman, Committee, on, Budget, ,, Finance, and, Administration, Doha, Development, Agenda, Global, Trust, Fund, General, Council, BFA, General, Council, WTO, BFA, Trust, Fund, CTD, Secretariat, UNCTAD, Members, BFA, CTD, CTD, WTO"

His Government's Generalized System of Preferences (GSP) Scheme for LDCs was open to all LDCs.

The representative of the United States said in response to the representative of India's inquiry regarding the AGOA that, a notification had been made to the CTD concerning certain preferences under it. The AGOA had been notified to the extent that preferences were given to LDCs. Her delegation would notify the AGOA and request a waiver in the Council for Trade and Goods. For the purposes of the CTD, the notification had been made by way of information on certain tariff preferences given to LDCs in Africa.","WTCOMTDM41.pdf","United, States, India, AGOA, CTD, AGOA, AGOA, Council, for, Trade, and, Goods, CTD, LDCs, Africa"
"4353",4353,"84","84.     The Secretariat said that it was custom not to circulate voluminous annexes to notifications of FTA's.

"4351",4351,"82","82.      The representative of India said that the problem that had been highlighted by the delegations of the United States and Pakistan was genuine.                  The reason behind the document's (WT/COMTD/N/16) late circulation was that his delegation had submitted the document after the first version of the agenda had been issued. It could therefore not have been included in the original version of the agenda. In view of that, his delegation had no problem in having the item included on the agenda for the next meeting of the CTD for further discussion. His delegation looked forward to clarification and consultation with the Secretariat with respect to the point made by the representative of the United States as to whether the FTA between India and Sri Lanka should be notified to the CRTA. He said that the last time that an agreement had been notified to the CTD under the ""Enabling Clause"", his delegation had raised some questions which remained unanswered. Firstly, his delegation wanted the full text of the Africa Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA) which had been notified and not made available at that meeting. Only the list of items on which some concessions were being made had been circulated at the meeting. He asked whether the full text of the AGOA had been received, and if so, if it had been circulated to Members.","WTCOMTDM41.pdf","India, United, States, Pakistan, CTD, Secretariat, United, States, FTA, India, Sri, Lanka, CRTA, CTD, AGOA, AGOA, Members"
"4350",4350,"81","81.     The Chairman said that he believed the best option was to keep item D on the agenda and revert to it at the next CTD meeting, along with the clarification that had been sought by the delegation of the United States.","WTCOMTDM41.pdf","Chairman, CTD, United, States"
"4349",4349,"80","80.     The representative of Pakistan said that, like the delegation of the United States, his delegation needed more time to look at document WT/COMTD/N/16.

He said that the comment made by the representative of the United States was valid and his delegation endorsed it.","WTCOMTDM41.pdf","Pakistan, United, States, CTD, United, States"
"4348",4348,"8","8.       The Chairman said that the first sub-item under item C on Technical Cooperation and Training was a statement by the Chairman of the Committee on Budget, Finance and Administration (BFA) in relation to pledges announced and payments received to finance the implementation of the Coordinated WTO Secretariat Annual Technical Assistance Plan. Further to the decision of the General Council in December 2001, the CTD and the Committee on Budget, Finance and Administration (BFA) were jointly responsible for monitoring the level of resources and expenses related to the execution of the Plan. Mr. McMillan, Chairman of the Committee on Budget, Finance and Administration, would therefore give a report to the CTD.","WTCOMTDM41.pdf","Chairman, Chairman, Committee, on, Budget, ,, Finance, and, Administration, BFA, WTO, Secretariat, General, Council, CTD, Committee, on, Budget, ,, Finance, and, Administration, BFA, McMillan, Chairman, Committee, on, Budget, ,, Finance, and, Administration, CTD"

She asked what the status of the notification was, whether it was for information purposes or whether Members were to engage in discussing it.

His delegation understood that there were constraints in scheduling the meetings and he suggested that the Secretariat bear those constraints in mind when drafting the agenda, instead of having to resort to last minute changes. He had noticed that technical cooperation had been taking up a few hours of the last two CTD meetings. It was important for delegations that the procedure for discussing various agenda items be made smooth. He suggested that one Session of the CTD session be allocated fully to technical cooperation. It would then be easier to know when the items would come up for discussion and the concerned officers could be present. In some missions various agenda items were dealt with by different officers. Given that there normally were a number of simultaneous meetings, coordination was necessary.","WTCOMTDM41.pdf","India, Sri, Lanka, India, Sri, Lanka, Secretariat, CTD"
"4344",4344,"76","76.       He said that the Government of India would grant duty-free access to all exports from Sri Lanka with respect to items freely importable into India. As the respective phase-out schedule of each country was concerned, zero duty would be applied by both governments to some items from the date of entry of the Agreement. For the remaining items, except for items contained in the negative lists, tariffs would be gradually reduced to zero per cent by the Government of India within three years from the entry into force of the Agreement. The Agreement provided for an eight year period for reducing the tariffs to zero level for the Government of Sri Lanka. The different time schedule for phasing out tariffs as well as the respective negative lists, reflected the recognition in the Agreement of the different levels of economic development in the two countries. He said that, with respect to Article XVII, the Agreement would enter into force on the 30th day after the parties had notified each other that their respective constitutional requirements and procedures had been completed. Following completion of those requirements and procedures by both the Governments, the FTA had entered into force on 15 December 2001 and had been notified to the WTO pursuant to the Decision of 28 November 1979, under the GATT on Differential and More Favourable Treatment, Reciprocity and Fuller Participation of Developing Countries, known as the ""Enabling Clause"". The Governments of India and Sri Lanka believed that the establishment and promotion of FTAs would help the development of their respective national economies and strengthen intra-regional economic cooperation as well as world trade.","WTCOMTDM41.pdf","India, Sri, Lanka, India, India, Sri, Lanka, FTA, WTO, GATT, India, Sri, Lanka"

The Free Trade Agreement (FTA) which had been signed between the Governments of India and Sri Lanka on 28 December 1998 had entered into force on 15 December 2001. The objectives of the Agreement were:                                                                                    WT/COMTD/M/41                                                                                           Page 21                 (i)     to promote through the expansion of trade the harmonious development of                         the economic relations between India and Sri Lanka;                 (ii)    to provide fair conditions of competition for trade between India and Sri                         Lanka;                 (iii)   for the contracting parties to pay due regard to the principle of reciprocity in                         their implementation of the Agreement; and                 (iv)    to contribute, to the harmonious development and expansion of world trade                         by the removal of barriers to trade.","WTCOMTDM41.pdf","Sri, Lanka, India, FTA, India, Sri, Lanka, India, Sri, Lanka, India, Sri, Lanka"

"4340",4340,"72","72.      Professor Nkuhlu in response to the delegation of Ghana's question about the WTO's relationship with NEPAD, said that the major issue for NEPAD was the issue of coordination. The primary support was in the area of capacity building. It was important that, in a complex environment where African countries had liberalised and were continuing to do so, the imbalances in the capacity to negotiate and defending positions that they wished to take remained a matter of concern. The WTO's role would be to provide technical support and capacity building. The NEPAD process on the African side was strengthening the political leadership. There was nothing more important than the issues related to trade to enable Africa to industrialise and become a meaningful player in the global economy. That was an area where NEPAD needed capacity and better coordination on the African side. NEPAD was not taking over the role of the individual countries that negotiated those positions, it needed better coordination and insurance that on the African side there was stronger coordinated political leadership. He thanked the delegation of Mauritius for stating the correction that NEPAD was not ""Knee-pad"".","WTCOMTDM41.pdf","Nkuhlu, Ghana, WTO, WTO, Africa, Mauritius"
"4339",4339,"71","71.     The representative of Mauritius said that his delegation appreciated what Professor Nkuhlu had said about the need for a new partnership based on mutual respect and mutual accountability. He referred to an article that had appeared in a publication the previous week, where a commentator had made disparaging remarks about NEPAD. It was compared to a ""knee pad"", suggesting that it was a symbol of capitulation. Such remarks about a bold and ambitious programme could do a lot of harm. That was why his delegation were gratified when Professor Nkuhlu had said that the G8 recognised that NEPAD was a bold and clear sighted vision of Africa's development.","WTCOMTDM41.pdf","Mauritius, Nkuhlu, Nkuhlu, Africa"
"4338",4338,"70","70.    The representative of Ghana said that he had been eager to hear what concrete role the WTO was expected to play in the NEPAD process.

"4337",4337,"7","7.      It was so agreed.","WTCOMTDM41.pdf",""
"4336",4336,"69","69.      He continued by saying that according to their statements, President Obasanjo, President Boreflecker, President Mbeki and President Watt, were satisfied with the response because it was an initial response, a point of departure. What the response said was that the invitation to change the partnership had been accepted and that new partnership would be based on certain principles and that as a start, the G8 was going to support actions and projects in order to kick start the programmes. The content of the programmes was still to be worked out. For example, there was a long list of actions under peace and stability, economic growth, and trade, and the next stage was to work out the detailed projects under each of those as well as the costing of those projects. That was possibly where the real test was going to be, in terms of working out those details and negotiating the support of the programmes. He said that the response from the African leaders was expected to be more concrete than it had been. That was a matter of concern. He said that for priorities like WT/COMTD/M/41 Page 20 universal primary education the costing had been made and what was required was a project such as the one that had been recently completed by the World Bank. That report went into detail country but country and it could have been taken as a starting-point to provide knowledge about how much money was needed to enable African countries to achieve universal primary education. NEPAD had worked out a detailed programme with the Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO) which clearly showed what should happen in each country under four programmes. NEPAD believed that there was enough material in that area to go further than they had done. He concluded by saying that the Heads of States Implementation Committee was a committee of the OAU, President Obasanjo, as Chairman of that Committee, would soon report to the OAU in full. The question of how the response of the G8 would be followed up was a matter for the OAU. A start had been made and like all projects of that kind it could have been better, however he believed that the foundations that were there were better than before.","WTCOMTDM41.pdf","Obasanjo, Boreflecker, Mbeki, Watt, World, Bank, Food, and, Agricultural, Organization, FAO, Heads, of, States, Implementation, Committee, OAU, Obasanjo, Chairman, Committee, OAU, OAU"
"4335",4335,"68","68.      He went on to say that the second leg focused on the relationship between Africa and the international community, primarily on issues that required coordination such as market access issues, the resolution of conflicts, and issues involving the reforms of Official Development Assistance (ODA). After the approval of the framework document by the Heads of State in July 2001, the heads of state had made a presentation on NEPAD to the G8 in Genoa explaining that the African leaders were serious about accelerating the pace of reform in Africa to make it attractive to domestic and foreign investors, but for that to succeed it would need additional resources from the international community. The response of the G8 was that it would constitute a committee of personal representatives, which would prepare a response to that presentation. The Steering Committee which supported the Heads of State Implementation Committee had spent from October 2001 to May 2002, providing inputs and having interaction with the G8 personal representatives to ensure that there was a common understanding on what Africa saw as priorities and how African leaders felt that those priorities should be addressed. That interaction made a significant input in the preparation of the response by the G8 personal representatives. The response was presented in Kananaskis in the form of a G8 Africa action Plan. That Plan covered all the priority areas as identified by the Heads of State Implementation Committee. The main point that the African leaders had been emphasizing was the need to build a new partnership that was anchored on mutual respect and mutual accountability. Not the kind of relationship that countries had then, where when a problem arose, it was only the LCD's that needed to reform. When things went wrong it was rare that it was the developed countries which had to take corrective action. It was that balanced partnership that African leaders were hoping for. He said that it also had, to a large extent, been achieved in the Kananaskis declaration. If one looked at the number of interactions that had taken place between African leaders and the G8 leaders during the last year, an agreement had been reached that those interactions were going to continue over the following years. There had been a commitment to accept NEPAD as the framework that would form the relationship between Africa and the developed countries. There had also been the commitment that no country that was genuinely committed to poverty reduction, good governance and economic reform, would be denied the chance to achieve the millenium development goals.","WTCOMTDM41.pdf","Africa, ODA, Genoa, Africa, Steering, Committee, State, Implementation, Committee, Africa, Kananaskis, Africa, State, Implementation, Committee, Kananaskis, Africa"
"4334",4334,"67","67.      Professor Wiseman Nkuhlu said that the African Heads of State that were leading the initiative had met the G8 in Kananaskis a few days earlier. He had prepared an input that dealt with the market assess initiative of the NEPAD programme. He said that due to the time constraints he would not deal with why the WTO should be interested in development. He would rather give an input on the issues that NEPAD had been dealing with. He would deal with the introduction of NEPAD and the market access initiative and also look at the relationship that NEPAD had with the WTO and the type of support that it wished to get from the WTO. He said that NEPAD was a political process. After approval of the policy framework document by the OAU Summit in 2001, the Heads of State Implementation Committee of Fifteen, three from each of the OAU regions had been appointed. The nominations had come from the African Ambassadors in Addis Ababa and those fifteen countries became the members of the Heads of State Implementation Committee. The focus of the Heads of State Implementation Committee was twofold. One element of focus was to accelerate the social, economic and political reforms in Africa and the second was to strengthen Africa's capacity to negotiate at a global level, especially with respect to trade issues. The internal focus was mainly initiatives that were directed at consolidating democracy and sound economic management, and covered conflict prevention; management resolution; promotion of intra-Africa trade; strengthening the regional economic community structures; as well as further measures to deepen democracy and promote sound economic management. The Heads of State Implementation Committee believed that those kind of initiatives were necessary not to address the concerns of the international community, but to deal with the fact that for Africa to develop it needed in the first place to give security to its own people. There had to be political stability and Africans needed to feel that their leaders took democracy seriously and that the issues of corruption were addressed. The Heads of State                                                                                       WT/COMTD/M/41                                                                                              Page 19 Implementation Committee believed that it was time for African leaders to take leadership in ensuring that those measures were taken. Since the establishment of the Heads of State Implementation Committee in October 2001, the focus had been on the social, economic and political transformation processes that needed to be accelerated in the continent and the roles that political leaders needed to play in that. He said that he was pleased that the outcome of that was a far-reaching agreement on an instrument called ""A Declaration on Political Economic Cooperate and Financial Governance"" which was going to be presented by the Committee to the OAU as well as an ""African Peer Review Mechanism"". The African Peer Review Mechanism's primary purpose was to enable African countries to share experiences on good practices and reinforce those practices. It was less of a punitive mechanism, that African leaders had in mind. It was actually to say that, if for example Botswana had done well in providing a conducive environment in the mining sector and as a result made itself attractive to mining companies, other countries could learn from that. It was also to ensure that those experiences in macroeconomic management were shared.","WTCOMTDM41.pdf","Wiseman, Nkuhlu, Kananaskis, WTO, WTO, WTO, OAU, State, Implementation, Committee, of, Fifteen, OAU, Addis, Ababa, State, Implementation, Committee, State, Implementation, Committee, Africa, Africa, State, Implementation, Committee, Africa, Implementation, Committee, State, Implementation, Committee, Committee, OAU, Botswana"
"4333",4333,"66","66.     The Chairman said that the New Partnership for Africa's Development (NEPAD) was a development policy framework first adopted by African Heads of State/Government in Lusaka in July 2001. It was a commitment by African leaders to eradicate poverty and to place Africa on a path of sustainable growth and development. NEPAD was considered as a long-term vision of an African-owned and African-led development programme. It was a plan for Africa's development which would promote, through a peer review mechanism, good governance, democracy, the rule of law, and good economic and corporate governance, in return for increased investments, aid and development support from the West, and full market access for Africa's exports. At the recently completed G8 Summit in Kananaskis, Canada, NEPAD had been on the agenda. He invited Professor Wiseman Nkuhlu, head of the NEPAD Secretariat to say a few words on the results of the G8 Summit for NEPAD, and suggest how the WTO, through its work on technical assistance and market access, could support the work of NEPAD, Africa's new development framework.","WTCOMTDM41.pdf","Chairman, Africa, Lusaka, Africa, Africa, Africa, Kananaskis, Canada, Wiseman, Nkuhlu, NEPAD, Secretariat, WTO, Africa"

For the time being, Members had not taken a decision regarding Chinese or Arabic. He said that asking for an endorsement from the General Council might constitute a problem. The General Council might find it difficult to take a decision on languages which, for the time being, the WTO had not adopted as official working languages. It was true that problems of translation of documents had always been a thorny issue within the WTO and many delegations had already flagged that point. Efforts were being made at the budgetary level in order to fill the gaps. He said that it was up to Members to decide.

Those came from the League of Arab States, OPEC, the Gulf Organization for Industrial Consulting, the Organisation Internationale de la Francophonie and the Common Fund for Commodities. The positions of delegations were well known and on the record.

The representative of the European Communities said that Members' continued support for ITC's work had been well expressed by Ambassador Girard and by what was reflected in paragraph 87 of document ITC/AG/(XXXV)/191 where the announcement of trust fund contributions were stated. He said that with respect to the point raised on the translation of documents, his delegation would have to revert to it after some reflection. It was not clear to him how the discussion on the language issue had gone in the JAG and what the nature of such a precedent would be.

"4323",4323,"57","57.     The representative of Senegal said that ITC's high quality technical cooperation contributions explained why the work of the JAG was followed closely by so many delegations, including his own. His delegation ensured that delegates from his capital participated every year. That was why his delegation, like others, wished to draw attention to the request for translation of documents by emphasising the fact that the preparatory documentation for the preparation of the JAG was important. Delegates from capitals were often faced with the problem that the documentation was only available in English. His delegation hoped that that problem would be resolved in the future given the importance of the work that was being done.","WTCOMTDM41.pdf","Senegal, ITC"

"4321",4321,"55","55.     The representative of Mauritania said that the ITC efficiently supported developing countries in a concrete way. His delegation hoped that support would be given to ITC so that its high quality work could continue. His delegation supported the delegation of Egypt's request for the translation of the JAG documents into all of the working languages of the United Nations (UN) system. That was important for all the documents within the WTO and would enable all delegations to work on a level playing field.

"4320",4320,"54","54.     The representative of Egypt said that his delegation appreciated the quality of the technical assistance provided by the ITC and hoped that it would be extended to as wide a range of sectors as possible. That was why his delegation, on behalf of the Arab Group, wished to see the CTD, and subsequently the General Council, approve the proposals made in paragraphs 89, 90 and 91 of the JAG Report. He reiterated that translation into Arabic of the documents of the meetings of the JAG, especially the annual report, would lead to wider dissemination of information on the activities and the technical assistance provided by the ITC in the Arab world. The greatest beneficiaries of such information dissemination would be the SMEs, which was the group that was supposed to benefit most from the ITC's activities.","WTCOMTDM41.pdf","Egypt, ITC, Arab, Group, CTD, General, Council, ITC, ITC"
"4319",4319,"53","53.      He went on to draw Members' attention to paragraphs 89 to 91 of the JAG Report, that was, relating to item 8 of the JAG agenda. At the thirty-fourth session of the JAG, held in the spring of 2001, a proposal had been made for issuing official documentation of the JAG in the Arabic and Chinese languages, in addition to the four current languages of publication. The request had been costed and included in the ITC budget submission to the United Nations and the WTO. However, no political decision had been reached at the WTO General Council or the UNCTAD Trade and Development Committee, which would have enabled the budgetary organs to consider the increased costs involved. The question had been raised once again at the JAG's thirty-fifth session in 2002. Following that meeting, he had received a communication from the Egyptian Ambassador urging him to reiterate to ITC's parent organizations how important it was for the documents of the JAG to be translated into Arabic and Chinese. He asked the CTD Chairman to consider that request so that a decision could be reached during the next budget cycle. He concluded by expressing, on behalf of the JAG, his gratitude to the numerous governments that had announced financial contributions to the ITC at that session, namely the delegations of Canada, China, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, India, Ireland, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland and the United Kingdom.","WTCOMTDM41.pdf","Members, ITC, United, Nations, WTO, WTO, General, Council, UNCTAD, Trade, and, Development, Committee, Ambassador, ITC, CTD, Chairman, ITC, Canada, China, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, India, Ireland, Italy, Netherlands, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland, United, Kingdom"
"4318",4318,"52","52.      He continued by saying that with respect to the specific topic of the Doha Development Agenda, the JAG had registered that in a paper ITC had identified existing programmes and priorities of developing countries, including LDCs and economies in transition, and had assessed its own capacity to deliver. The JAG had acknowledged that ITC was well positioned to make a contribution but that it had to expand its resource base to implement its planned approach.","WTCOMTDM41.pdf","Doha, Development, Agenda, ITC, ITC"
"4317",4317,"51","51.     Ambassador Girard said that, during its thirty-fifth session in April 2002, the JAG had reviewed the work carried out by the International Trade Centre (ITC) in 2001. The Report of the JAG had been issued as document ITC/AG/(XXXV)/191. In their opening statements, the UNCTAD Secretary-General and the WTO Deputy Director-General had underscored the high quality of ITC's work. They had both pointed out that ITC, UNCTAD and the WTO had pursued and expanded their cooperation, especially with regard to the LDCs. The WTO DDG had also emphasized that, in the Doha Ministerial Declaration, the Ministers had reaffirmed their support for the work done by ITC and had stressed that it should be further enhanced. In that connection, the DDG had expressed the wish that ITC's donors allocate extra funding so that the ITC could step up its efforts to increase the capabilities of developing countries. The Director-General of UNIDO, who had attended a meeting of the Joint Advisory Group for the first time, had referred to the increased cooperation between UNIDO and ITC, UNCTAD and the WTO and trusted that such meetings would help UNIDO to find better ways to interact and achieve joint objectives by working cooperatively. In his introductory statement, the Executive Director of the ITC had noted that, over the past three years, the ITC had worked towards becoming a more focused organization. Its emphasis was directly focused on the critical issue of building national capacities for international competitiveness. The Executive Director had said that he hoped that the thirty-fifth session of the JAG would provide ITC with the guidance and resources it needed to respond comprehensively to the challenge of delivering trade-related assistance and capacity building in the post-Doha era. The Joint Advisory Group had expressed its satisfaction with ITC's performance in 2001, noting that the organization had maintained its role as a key niche player in its sphere, and had offered high quality service to its clients. A number of topics had been addressed in the general debate. The Joint Advisory Group considered that the Joint Integrated Technical Assistance Programme (JITAP) and its coordinated approach to technical cooperation had worked extremely well. Some representatives had recommended, not only that JITAP be continued, but also that the approach be replicated in other developing countries. Several representatives had underscored the importance of the World Trade Net programme in building business capabilities for WT/COMTD/M/41 Page 16 timely inputs into preparations for negotiations and in reinforcing cooperation between the business community and trade policy makers. Comments had also been made on ITC's participation in the Integrated Framework initiative, and the organization had undertaken to provide active export development support for countries participating in the Integrated Framework. Other delegations had encouraged ITC to work towards an expansion of the number of LDCs involved. The Joint Advisory Group had mentioned the role played by ITC in fostering the public-private sector partnership both in the preparations for and in the follow-up to the Doha Ministerial Conference. It had noted ITC's work in the area of trade in services and commended the launching of the E-Trade Bridge programme, which was seen to be relevant to the future international competitiveness of developing and transition economies, despite the connectivity problems encountered by many of them. In addition, the Joint Advisory Group had taken note of the Report of the Consultative Committee on ITC's Global Trust Fund.","WTCOMTDM41.pdf","Ambassador, Girard, ITC, UNCTAD, WTO, Director-General, ITC, ITC, UNCTAD, WTO, WTO, DDG, ITC, DDG, ITC, ITC, Director-General, UNIDO, Joint, Advisory, Group, UNIDO, ITC, UNCTAD, WTO, UNIDO, Director, ITC, ITC, Director, ITC, Joint, Advisory, Group, ITC, Joint, Advisory, Group, Joint, Integrated, Technical, Assistance, Programme, ITC, ITC, Joint, Advisory, Group, ITC, Doha, Ministerial, Conference, ITC, Joint, Advisory, Group, Consultative, Committee, ITC, Global, Trust, Fund"

"4312",4312,"47","47.      He continued by saying that some delegations had felt that the 31 July deadline was too short for Members to submit their requests for 2003. He said that the Secretariat was in the hands of the Members. If Members could not submit their requests by 31 July, then the Secretariat would have to delay the creation of the 2003 Technical Assistance Plan. However, it was necessary to stick to that deadline if Members wished to present the 2003 Plan to the October meeting of the CTD and the Budget Committee at the end of November and be able to finalise before the end of 2002. Members would otherwise find themselves in the same situation that they had found themselves in 2002, with the 2003 Plan only to be approved by the CTD in March 2003. That would delay and make the implementation of the programme difficult. The longer the deadline of 31 July was put off, the more difficult it would be to have the Plan ready for 2003. He said that, with respect to identifying needs,                                                                                    WT/COMTD/M/41                                                                                           Page 15 he had heard Members say that they needed technical cooperation to enable them to identify their technical cooperation needs. Everything was possible. However, missions by definition were expensive because people needed to be sent out to the different countries. That was why the Secretariat did not leave identification of needs by missions. Sending out special missions to identify technical cooperation needs meant that there would be less resources available to provide regular technical cooperation. With respect to the question posed by the delegation of Egypt on the internet courses, he said that the pilot programme included some fifty participants from thirty different developing countries. Once the evaluation of that activity had been carried out, the Secretariat would be able to see how to develop the programme further.","WTCOMTDM41.pdf","Members, Secretariat, Members, Members, Secretariat, Members, CTD, Budget, Committee, Members, CTD, Members, Secretariat, Egypt, Secretariat"
"4311",4311,"46","46.      He went on to say that the Advanced Training Programme for Government Officials and Negotiators was a direct result of the fact that a round had been launched at the Doha Ministerial Conference and that there was an upcoming Ministerial Conference. Members had therefore identified the need to improve the negotiating capacity of government officials in charge of trade policy. That was why those courses were going to focus on negotiation skills. They would not be general courses on the WTO, but would focus on negotiation techniques. He said that Members could see in CRP/1 that one of the courses had already taken place and that other courses would take place in Arab countries, Central Europe, the African Anglophone countries throughout 2002. The courses would then continue in 2003 in Asia and the Pacific. With respect to the question on the Asia/Pacific course, he said that it would in principle take place at the Beijing University with the help of the Asian Development Bank, and that it would be given to 29 participating countries, with one participant from each country. The short-term trade policy courses were also the result of demand. Members had expressed the view that the short-term trade policy courses were a good product that should be kept. However, Members wished to have something more flexible so that those courses could be delivered in the field over a shorter time-period. The Secretariat had then offered courses with a duration of three weeks in the requesting countries. In response to the question from the delegation of the European Communities regarding the difference between the WTO Training Institute and WTO technical cooperation, he said that it was not useful to get into that debate. There were always difficulties in defining where the line between them should be drawn. Within technical cooperation there was constant progress with respect to its content, from basic technical cooperation which consisted of explaining the rules as they were, to a more proactive technical cooperation with a stronger focus on training. Of the three field-based activities, only the ad hoc residential trade policy courses were entirely provided by the Training Institute. The other two had a technical assistance component. That was a situation which he was not certain would last because the three field-based activities needed to be defined in the future and remained flexible. He said that the situation that Members currently saw was not necessarily the situation they would see in six months' or a year's time.","WTCOMTDM41.pdf","Advanced, Training, Programme, Members, WTO, Members, Central, Europe, Asia, Pacific, Beijing, University, Asian, Development, Bank, Members, Members, Secretariat, WTO, Training, Institute, WTO, Training, Institute, Members"
"4310",4310,"45","45.      Deputy Director-General Mr. Ravier said that the Secretariat had noted the many statements made and would respond individually to Members on questions he would not mention. A number of the questions asked dealt with the field-based activities. The field-based activities related to three different products. They were the ad hoc residential trade policy courses in Nairobi and Casablanca, the short trade policy courses and the advanced training programme for negotiators which was described in Annex I of the 2002 Technical Assistance Plan. All were new activities which had to be evaluated before they were prolonged or extended. The ad hoc residential trade policy courses represented a first attempt to deliver ad hoc trade policy courses. The reason why they were being delivered in the African countries was because it was on the African continent that the needs were the greatest. Those courses were demand-driven and it was possible to hold them in other countries. The Director-General, during his trips to Africa over the past month, had noted that the needs were WT/COMTD/M/41 Page 14 greatest there and thus the choice of having the courses in one Anglophone and one Francophone African country had been made according to needs expressed. That did not mean that there were no needs elsewhere and that the Secretariat would not take other needs into account if they were expressed. However, the two courses first had to be held and evaluated. In response to the question posed by the delegation of Malaysia as to how it could be ensured that the quality of those courses would be as high as those being held in Geneva, he said that once the courses had taken place, their effectiveness could be evaluated. The Training Institute had closely followed the process of preparing the courses in line with the Geneva-based courses and the teaching staff would be a mix of local trainers, people from the WTO Secretariat, and people from outside the WTO Secretariat. There was no reason to believe that the quality of the residential training courses would be lower than that of the courses held at the WTO. The only difference was that participants in a course held at the WTO headquarters would be able to meet with delegations and attend WTO meetings. From that point of view there was an additional advantage of attending the Geneva-based courses. Apart that, everything else should qualitatively be the same as what took place in Geneva.","WTCOMTDM41.pdf","Director-General, Ravier, Secretariat, Members, Nairobi, Casablanca, Director-General, Africa, Secretariat, Malaysia, Geneva, Training, Institute, WTO, Secretariat, WTO, Secretariat, WTO, WTO, WTO, Geneva"

The representative of Guinea said that her delegation attached great importance to the WTO training courses since they provided trade-policy capacity-building for officials in her Government in both the short and long terms. She thanked the Secretariat for its contributions to the seminar on agriculture organized in Conakry by UNCTAD for ECOWAS member countries and said that her delegation welcomed the continuation of such cooperation in the future. Her delegation hoped that the Secretariat would give priority to the training of civil servants in Member countries so that they could train other trainers on trade policy. Her delegation also wished to have residential trade-policy courses, similar to those organized in Kenya and Morocco, organised in other capitals in Africa. She said that her Government would be pleased to host such activities in its capital in 2003.","WTCOMTDM41.pdf","Guinea, WTO, Secretariat, Conakry, UNCTAD, ECOWAS, Secretariat, Member, Kenya, Morocco, Africa"

The representative of Egypt said that if he had understood correctly, with respect to the internet-based course in CRP/2, Deputy Director-General Mr. Ravier had said that the course would, in the pilot phase, include 30 participants from different countries. There were currently only four participants from Africa and he asked why that number was so low. He also asked whether, in CRP/2 under Distance-Learning Activities, ""Pilot Project (English) Geneva"" meant that participants in capitals took the course via the internet. He was therefore unsure what ""Geneva"" referred to.","WTCOMTDM41.pdf","Egypt, Director-General, Ravier, Africa, Geneva"
"4305",4305,"40","40.     The representative of Malaysia asked whether the number of participants listed in CRP/2 for the Geneva-based trade policy courses included those that were self-financed. Her delegation would appreciate to get a clearer picture of which participants were funded by the WTO and which were                                                                                    WT/COMTD/M/41                                                                                           Page 13 self-funded. With respect to the ad hoc residential trade policy courses, she asked how the residential trade policy courses being held in certain regions would affect the participation in the regular Geneva- based trade policy courses. She asked how it could be ensured that the quality of the field-based training given in the residential trade-policy courses would be equally high as for those carried out in Geneva. With respect to the normal technical assistance activities, her delegation was aware that it might not be possible for a Member's technical assistance needs to be solely met by the WTO. Cooperation with other organizations, as well as regional development banks, could be useful to ensure a more seamless delivery of technical assistance. In some WTO Committees, such as the TBT and SPS Committees, some of the technical assistance requested was of a technical nature and went beyond the competence of the WTO. She asked how the WTO could address such needs. Her delegation was aware that some WTO agreements provided for technical assistance on a bilateral basis. She asked how the Technical Cooperation Division could work with the bilateral providers to meet some of those requests which could be met more substantively.","WTCOMTDM41.pdf","Malaysia, WTO, Geneva, Geneva, Member, WTO, WTO, Committees, TBT, WTO, WTO, WTO"
"4304",4304,"4","4.      The Chairman recalled that in previous sessions of the CTD, Members had agreed to invite a number of intergovernmental organizations on an ad hoc meeting-by-meeting basis. Those were the Arab Maghreb Union (AMU); the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS); the Economic Cooperation Organisation (ECO); the Inter-Arab Investment Guarantee Corporation; the Islamic Development Bank (IDB); the Organisation of African Unity (OAU); the Organisation of the Islamic Conference (OIC); the South Centre; the South Pacific Forum; the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP); the West African Economic and Monetary Union (WAEMU); and the World Intellectual Property Organisation (WIPO).

"4303",4303,"39","39.     The representative of Tanzania said that the Secretariat needed to assist delegations, and especially LDCs, in coming up with activities for the 2003 Plan as the July deadline was too close. Her delegation appreciated the effort made to organize field-based trade-policy courses in Nairobi and Morocco. She said that as thirty-four of the LDCs were in Africa, her delegation expected that one of the courses would be held in one of those LDCs. If the WTO was serious in assisting LDCs to build capacity, then one of the courses should be held in an LDC. Universities existed in the LDCs. It would thus be possible to hold training there. It was only a question of selection one LDC and begin the course.","WTCOMTDM41.pdf","Tanzania, Secretariat, Nairobi, Morocco, Africa, WTO, LDC"
"4302",4302,"38","38.      The representative of Oman said that her Government had benefitted from several national and regional activities in 2002. The national and regional seminars had been well attended and Omani officials had been satisfied with the results. She said that her Government, as one of the recently acceded Members, had extensive obligations that had to be implemented immediately, without any transitional periods. Her delegation believed that giving priority to the technical assistance provided to her Government would enable Omani officials to enhance their understanding of the obligations that had to be implemented. Technical assistance should not only be provided in the form of seminars or workshops. It should also include sponsoring the participation of officials from her capital to attend seminars and meetings in Geneva. Without that type of assistance, it would always remain difficult for her delegation to fully participate in WTO's work. She concluded by saying that her delegation would work with the Chairman in order to ensure that its needs and priorities were reflected in the 2003 Plan.","WTCOMTDM41.pdf","Oman, Members, Geneva, WTO, Chairman"
"4301",4301,"37","37.      The representative of China said that his delegation, like other developing Member countries, attached great importance to the issue of capacity-building. However, it was unfortunate that, in spite of the efforts made, it was still difficult to meet Members' increasing and diversified needs. It was his delegation's view that capacity-building was part of a country's development endeavour. No single agency, including the WTO, could meet all the demands in that area. It was thus important to find creative ways to match the resources of the WTO with other resources. His delegation was pleased to see that the WTO Secretariat had begun cooperation with regional development banks. That was a typical example of how the WTO resources could be used as a leverage. Cooperation with regional development banks would be conducive to making the training activities more relevant in the regional context. It was his delegation's view that the potential capacity of developing country Members to be involved in technical assistance activities should not be underestimated. There were many existing training facilities, human resources, and sometimes financial resources available in developing Members countries that could be used. The question was how to integrate all those factors into professional training activities. In that respect, his delegation suggested that the Technical Cooperation Division develop a handbook to help developing countries develop and implement training and technical assistance activities for themselves and by themselves.","WTCOMTDM41.pdf","China, Member, Members, WTO, WTO, WTO, Secretariat, WTO, Members, Members, Technical, Cooperation, Division"
"4300",4300,"36","36.    The representative of Morocco said that the trade policy course to be held in Casablanca in July would be the first trade policy course in French to be held outside Geneva. That course would be WT/COMTD/M/41 Page 12 held in partnership with the Institut Supérieur de Commerce et de Gestion d'Entreprise (ISCAE) in Casablanca. That was concrete proof of a good form of cooperation with universities which his delegation had always advocated, particularly in the CTD. His delegation believed that that additional activity was a good initiative which would help to establish real proximity in a continent where there was great need for technical assistance and capacity-building. His delegation hoped that that type of activity would be expanded to other regions in the future. He said that the Memorandum of Understanding that had been signed between the Casablanca Institute and the WTO Training Institute was a concrete example of the new strategy within a framework of activities which was strategic and beneficial to the WTO and which was aimed at capacity building and bringing about a greater proximity.","WTCOMTDM41.pdf","Morocco, Casablanca, Geneva, Institut, Supérieur, de, Commerce, Casablanca, CTD, Casablanca, Institute, WTO, Training, Institute, WTO"
"4299",4299,"35","35.      He went on to say that with respect to the activities under training, including those covered by the Training Institute and by other parts of the Secretariat, his delegation wished to have more information on who exactly did what and why. From his delegation's point of view, training was different to technical assistance because it was mainly a deductive exercise and it might be useful to ensure that the necessary know how and synergies, which were possible were fully utilised, even if different WTO divisions were involved. He noted that the number of participants in the African field- based course had decreased from 25 to 19. He asked what implication that would have on costs and on the ratio of trainers to trainees, which, in his delegation's view, might not even initially have been optimal. He said that with respect to point 12 of CRP/1, it was interesting to hear what the representative of Kenya had said on the planning and the difficulty to get the necessary information. His delegation was pleased that the Secretariat had undertaken steps to ensure that the information necessary could come forward, not only from Members' missions but also directly from their governments. His delegation believed that there were other sources to ensure that the Plan broadly covered all the issues that Members wished to address. He gave the example of his delegation's wish to ensure that the information from other Committees dealing with technical assistance was adequately taken into account. He asked the Chairman to ensure that that source was used to fully assess the needs of Members. Going through what had been done in other WTO Committees on technical assistance was one way to ensure that nothing was forgotten, no country was overlooked, and that all aspects of what should be done were taken into account. With respect to the point made on auditing, he said that it was still early to talk about the first experiences with the 2002 Annual Technical Assistance Plan because any auditing exercise had just begun and there would not be much of a result available. However, by the end of the year some sort of ongoing evaluation should be part of the exercise in order to give delegations a full picture of what was taking place.","WTCOMTDM41.pdf","Training, Institute, Secretariat, WTO, Kenya, Secretariat, Members, Members, Chairman, Members, WTO, Committees"
"4298",4298,"34","34.      The representative of the European Communities said that the comments he was about to make were only to allow for the optimal preparation of the mid-July event on technical assistance and the preparation of a report at the end of the year. He questioned whether the CRP form of documents for the information on the Implementation of the 2002 Technical Assistance Plan was the best way to proceed. Those documents were not available on the website and he asked why the information could not be provided in the form of normal WTO documents that would allow maximum diffusion and distribution of that information. He said that it was not clear whether the situation regarding the ad-hoc activities had improved and what the financial implications would be of the planned activities and the extra one third ad-hoc activities taking place. He asked what criteria the Secretariat would use when deciding on the execution of new ad hoc activities. It was his understanding that unless the criteria was made clear, the Trust Fund would be difficult to use. His delegation felt that the database was important. However, there seemed to have been problems with the information gathering with the OECD with respect to how the activities would be classified. His delegation asked for information on progress in that regard. With respect to point 9 in CPR/1 on Inter-Agency Cooperation, he suggested that the Secretariat provide Members with a short outline of what the state of play was with the various other agencies in terms of what sort of memorandum had been concluded, what cooperation had been made, and what was envisaged. That could be part of the preparation of the 2003 Technical Assistance Plan. It was sometimes difficult ex-post to evaluate and consider the number of numerous activities, but it was important to get an idea on how the issue was moving forward.","WTCOMTDM41.pdf","European, Communities, CRP, WTO, Secretariat, Trust, Fund, OECD, Secretariat, Members"
"4297",4297,"33","33.      The representative of Canada said that her delegation felt that the start, in the first part of the year, in the delivery of the Doha Development Agenda Technical Assistance was impressive. 2002 was clearly a year of learning. Many different modes of delivery were being tried, from short and medium to long-term types of programmes both in Geneva and the field. Her delegation hoped that those were being monitored through the work of Mr. Paul Rolian, Director of the Technical Cooperation Audit, and looked forward to a report on all those various activities. She said that with respect to the question of ad-hoc versus planned activities, her delegation had noted, as had other delegations, that approximately a third of the technical assistance activities that had taken place were ad hoc activities. That was not necessarily good or bad. However, it did have financial and staffing implications. Her delegation hoped that when the report was provided, it would indicate where the planned activities had been delivered, where ad-hoc activities had been introduced, why the ad-hoc activities had been given priority over planned activities and what activities had not been delivered                                                                                     WT/COMTD/M/41                                                                                            Page 11 and why. She said that she was certain there were good reasons why some planned activities were not delivered. There might for example be timing constraints. Her delegation wished to see that presented in the end of the year report to get the full picture. Her delegation appreciated the Secretariat's work towards a 2003 Plan which would reduce the number of ad-hoc activities bringing the planned and delivered activities much closer together.","WTCOMTDM41.pdf","Canada, Doha, Development, Agenda, Technical, Assistance, Geneva, Paul, Rolian, Director, Technical, Cooperation, Audit, Secretariat"
"4296",4296,"32","32.      The representative of Kenya said that he hoped that the delegation of Pakistan had not proposed that the costs for the ad hoc field-based trade policy courses remain ad-hoc. His delegation wished to see the courses become permanent features in Africa. That would enable African countries to participate fully in WTO activities. He said that he hoped that adequate funds would be sourced and set aside to ensure that those courses were run on a permanent basis. His delegation hoped that the Geneva-based training of trainers activities could be included in the field-based activities. He said that perhaps they could borrow the form used in the JITAP programme which had a training component, so that there would be trainers in the host countries who could expand the training. He said that with respect to the 2003 Technical Assistance Plan, a deadline of 31 July for the submission of requests had been set. That deadline was close in time and delegations sometimes needed technical assistance to identify their technical assistance needs. Members had to consider that when working on the work programme. He proposed that the Secretariat send missions to Members that had not been responding in time to assist them identify their technical assistance needs. That would make the work programme comprehensive and minimise the number of ad-hoc requests.","WTCOMTDM41.pdf","Kenya, Pakistan, Africa, WTO, Members, Secretariat, Members"
"4295",4295,"31","31.     The representative of Indonesia sought clarification on the field-based activities and asked whether the Secretariat would provide such ad-hoc trade policy courses in other regions. The Doha Development Agenda Advanced Training Course in Annex II of CRP/1 showed that the training for government officials would be organised sometime in April 2003, but his delegation was not aware of the estimated number of participants for that course. He asked if the Secretariat could provide the estimated number of participants in those activities for the Asia Pacific Region.","WTCOMTDM41.pdf","Indonesia, Secretariat, Doha, Development, Agenda, Advanced, Training, Course, Secretariat, Asia, Pacific, Region"
"4294",4294,"30","30.      The representative of Colombia said that despite the fact that there were a large number of technical assistance activities which remained to be carried out during the rest of the year, she commended the effort put into implementing the agreed activities for 2002. However, her delegation hoped that the rate of implementation would improve in 2003. Her Government was of the view that predictability and regional balance in the distribution of activities were key factors on which the new technical cooperation strategy should be based. Developing country beneficiaries would through such capacity building be provided with additional knowledge and increased negotiating power which would help them achieve fuller participation in the multilateral trading system. Her delegation hoped that those two elements, together with its request for technical cooperation activities, would be pivotal in the preparation of the 2003 Technical Assistance Plan and that the personal decisions of some members of the Secretariat under no circumstances would be allowed to prevail and end up obstructing the implementation of the activities. She thanked the Technical Cooperation Division for WT/COMTD/M/41 Page 10 its contribution to the development of the regional dispute settlement seminar held in Bogotá and attended by almost 40 Latin American officials. The seminar had been highly successful and achieved its objectives. She supported the point made by the representative of Venezuela with respect to the importance of the training of trainers. The technical assistance established in the Annual Plan was of particular significance to her Government since it provided her Government's officials with training in important current issues in the short term. It was essential that it be given greater importance and that particular attention be paid to the allocation of resources to the second phase of the Training of Trainers Project and the distance-learning trade policy courses, since those were long-term projects which would enhance awareness of WTO issues in Members and would consequently have a great impact. A training of trainers programme in a university and at an international business department had been established in her country, both of which had been met with great success in all regions. That project had been set up and coordinated by the Ministry of Foreign Trade in conjunction with a group of 50 universities throughout the country and had succeeded in developing export culture. Her delegation believed that it was the universities and institutions that had made it possible to ensure that information on international trade was disseminated in a coherent and consistent manner. Students, officials and entrepreneurs were all aware of the benefits accruing to them as a result of that. It was important to increase resources for the training of trainers programme, which would increase the capacity of her Government's officials.","WTCOMTDM41.pdf","Colombia, Secretariat, Technical, Cooperation, Division, Bogotá, Venezuela, Training, of, Trainers, Project, WTO, Members, Ministry, of, Foreign, Trade"

"4292",4292,"29","29.      The representative of Pakistan said that his delegation had a special interest in the field-based activities because in 1999 it had made a similar proposal. His delegation had proposed that in addition to the trade policy courses conducted in Geneva it would be worthwhile to have ten to twelve week duration trade policy courses in host countries on a regional or country-specific basis. He said that he was pleased that the Secretariat had been able to operationalize that proposal. His delegation sought clarification with respect to the location of the field-based training activities. He asked whether they were demand driven, in terms of the host country requesting for the courses, as was the case with the delegations of Kenya and Morocco. He asked if that was so, who would finance those courses, whether the financing would be on a joint basis, and whether other governments could apply to host such courses Holding field-based trade policy courses was beneficial for any country as the training could reach a larger number of people.","WTCOMTDM41.pdf","Pakistan, Geneva, Secretariat, Kenya, Morocco"
"4291",4291,"28","28.     She went on to say that DDG Ravier had reported that the training programmes were working well and that their objectives had been updated in order to improve the participation in negotiations. Her delegation was pleased to see that courses had been organised jointly by the WTO and Georgetown University. Making a distinction between training provided in Geneva, distance training and training in the field was positive. With respect to distance learning activities, her delegation wished to know when the pilot courses would be established so that Members could follow them in Spanish. With respect to the training for trainers programme, she said that it would improve the                                                                                       WT/COMTD/M/41                                                                                               Page 9 quality of trainers so that they could improve the quality of their work. Her delegation had a concept of training that went somewhat beyond that. It felt that training was for public officials, whether or not they were negotiators. The consequence of that training would be to build the capacity of officials in carrying out activities in relation to trade. It was her delegation's understanding from the report that the training of trainers programme was being strengthened. Another aspect was the ""export"" of such courses to the regions. Two pilot projects already existed in Africa and, at the last CTD meeting, Members had been informed that such projects would be launched in other regions, including Latin America and the Caribbean. Her delegation's expectation was to have a broader group of public officials in the regions making use of the resources made available to them. Many of the facilitators would be the negotiators and officials who had attended the training programme in Geneva. The third aspect was a much broader view of the training. The fourth part of ""Strengthening Cooperation between the Institute and Universities"" in the report referred to the training of professors who taught WTO disciplines in universities and postgraduate institutes. That was important and the WTO Secretariat had to pay close attention to that group of people for two reasons. Firstly, in addition to professionals aiming for public service employment, universities also trained people intending to go into private-sector firms and the private sector also needed a better grasp of WTO objectives and principles since many firms were affected by the processes and the decisions adopted in the WTO. Countless professors from her country taught WTO disciplines in universities and postgraduate study centres, with the best of intentions. However, the knowledge they had about the WTO and its Agreements was limited in many cases. That was why her delegation felt that it was the Secretariat's duty to provide the tools that those professors required to be able to teach in a more effective way. That could contribute to improving the negative image in universities of what the WTO's principles and long-term goals were. Teaching clarified doubts which, in many cases, arose as a result of the lack of information. That was in line with what was proposed by the WTO on pages 17 and 16 in its booklet ""The Road to Doha and Beyond"". She concluded by saying that it was important to keep the spirit of independence which existed in universities. That independent spirit brought with it challenges but would enable Members to improve the image of the WTO in teaching institutions in her country.","WTCOMTDM41.pdf","Ravier, WTO, Georgetown, University, Geneva, Members, Africa, Members, Latin, America, Caribbean, Geneva, Institute, and, Universities, WTO, WTO, Secretariat, WTO, WTO, WTO, WTO, Secretariat, WTO, WTO, Doha, Members, WTO"
"4290",4290,"27","27.      The representative of Venezuela reiterated that her delegation attached great importance to the issue of technical assistance and capacity building. Paragraph 3 of document CPR/1 indicated that 185 different activities had been planned and carried out. Of those, 75 had responded to requests by members. Her delegation was pleased that the Secretariat was taking into account requests which had not been included in the Plan and which responded to the requirements of developing countries. Her delegation noted that 37 per cent of the activities under the Technical Assistance Plan had been carried out and agreed with the representative of Japan in that the Secretariat had to improve the pace of implementation in order for all the planned activities to be carried out. That would enable the Secretariat to respond to the ad hoc requests made by Members. She said that she wished to make a distinction between ""regular"" technical assistance coming from the WTO which related to the application of the agreements and the ""new"" technical assistance which responded to the different goals set for Members, especially the developing country Members, at the Doha Ministerial Conference. Her delegation would be concerned if the importance of the normal technical assistance programmes which dealt with the application and implementation of Agreements, for example, the trade policy review, were left aside. There should be no imbalance between the two types of technical assistance and she hoped that the Secretariat could make a distinction between those two types of technical assistance. Her delegation was pleased with the efforts made to strengthen the ties with regional development banks and to carry out the work plan approved by Ministers at the Doha Ministerial Conference with respect to inter-agency cooperation. She noted the distinction made between cooperation with the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) which was referred to in the document as ""an effective form of fusion with WIPO"", and cooperation with UNCTAD which was progressing on an ad-hoc basis. Cooperation between agencies was important and cooperation with UNCTAD deserved special attention. Her delegation hoped that future cooperation, in all its aspects, would become effective and efficient.","WTCOMTDM41.pdf","Venezuela, Secretariat, Japan, Secretariat, Secretariat, Members, WTO, Members, Members, Doha, Ministerial, Conference, Secretariat, Doha, Ministerial, Conference, World, Intellectual, Property, Organization, WIPO, WIPO, UNCTAD, UNCTAD"
"4289",4289,"26","26.      The representative of Japan said that his delegation felt that the technical assistance and capacity-building activities were important instruments to effectively integrate beneficiary countries into the multilateral trade system. His delegation was ready to continue to support the efforts by beneficiary countries through the WTO, other international organizations or through bilateral activities. He said that he wished to make three points. The first was with respect to the revised WT/COMTD/M/41 Page 8 version of the Report of the Pledging Conference. His delegation was one of those which had registered concern over the previous version and it appreciated the improved version that the Secretariat had provided. The second point was that his delegation was pleased that the Secretariat currently was better equipped to meet the target of the Technical Assistance Plan for 2002, since his delegation had had certain concerns regarding the pace with which the Secretariat had implemented the planned activities. In that regard he noted that Mr. Ravier had mentioned that ad hoc requests were being made that it would take time to respond to. The preparation time for the 2002 Technical Assistance Plan had been rather limited. That was one of the main reasons why ad hoc requests were being made by delegations. The third point was that, in order to frame the 2003 Technical Assistance Plan, Members needed to keep the pace explained by Mr. Ravier. That would give for the 2003 Technical Assistance Plan a better prospect of success. He said that in order for it to be successful it was important to monitor the effectiveness and pace of the implementation of the activities and then report back to the CTD or any other fora. That would provide Members with a view about what had to be improved and what should be continued in the following year. Reflecting on his Government's bilateral experience with other developing partners, he said that it was important for beneficiary countries to tactically choose the activities in order for them to improve the capacity within that beneficiary country's government. His delegation would therefore welcome information from the Secretariat with respect to how it chose the trainees of the training activities, the effectiveness of those activities, the pace of future activities and how the Secretariat could encourage the beneficiary countries to provide their priority requests by the end of July.","WTCOMTDM41.pdf","Japan, WTO, Secretariat, Secretariat, Secretariat, Ravier, Members, Ravier, CTD, Members, Secretariat, Secretariat"
"4288",4288,"25","25.      He went on to mention the strengthened cooperation between the WTO Training Institute and universities. The Training Institute was moving towards such cooperation which would be non- exclusive. He recalled that one of the reasons why the Training Institute had been created was to give it a certain amount of independence which would facilitate the building of relationships with other academic institutions throughout the world. The Secretariat wanted to allow academic institutions to have an independent partner to deal with. The Secretariat's relationship with academic institutions had since developed rapidly and there were several possibilities that had been realised in the framework of that cooperation. A large number of potential partners had shown a keen interest and the Secretariat would have to choose some in a way that would not be discriminatory. The Secretariat would have to consider the logistical problems, the different types of cooperation, and the financial and human resources available in the Institute.","WTCOMTDM41.pdf","WTO, Training, Institute, Training, Institute, Training, Institute, Secretariat, Secretariat, Secretariat, Secretariat"
"4287",4287,"24","24.      He went on to speak about the other two categories of activities, the distance learning activities and the activities in the field. There were two types of distance learning. The first was video conferencing where the Training Institute, in close cooperation with the World Bank, had taken part in five conferences held simultaneously in Geneva and Washington and four other sites in developing countries. To date there had been twenty hours of training given in twenty developing country partners, using the telecommunications technology and the infrastructure set up by the World Bank as part of its ""Global Development Learning Network"" programme. The second type of distance learning was the new online courses. After several months of designing the courses, the Training Institute had initiated an introductory course to the WTO and its fundamental principles, which was currently available on the Internet in English. The participants were guided by tutors which made the courses truly interactive. It was still a pilot project in which around 50 national officials from 30 developing countries took part. The lessons to be learnt from that pilot project would enable the Secretariat in 2003, to launch a series of Internet-based interactive courses in the three official languages of the WTO on various subjects. He said that the third category of training activities at the WTO were the field-based activities. Those were activities conducted outside Geneva. The first two lines under that heading showed two new trade policy courses lasting three months. They would be held in Casablanca in French and in Nairobi in English, and would start on 8 and 15 July respectively. He said that those recent initiatives taken by the Director-General were supplementary to the regular activities of the Training Institute. It was a new activity that had been launched over a short period of time. He said that there had been problems with financing but he hoped that the Secretariat would be able to obtain the necessary funds in the near future. There were also 15 short trade policy courses, which should involve more than 450 participants, and there were four advanced training programmes for negotiators which should involve around 100 participants.","WTCOMTDM41.pdf","Training, Institute, World, Bank, Geneva, Washington, World, Bank, Training, Institute, WTO, Secretariat, WTO, WTO, Geneva, Casablanca, Nairobi, Director-General, Training, Institute, Secretariat"
"4286",4286,"23","23.      He went on to say conference room paper CRP/2 contained a list of all the training activities offered by the Secretariat as a whole in 2002. The presentation in a single document should provide Members with information on all the WTO's training activities. There were three categories of activities. Those held in Geneva, long-distance training activities and field-based activities at the regional level. There were five types of Geneva-based activities. The first four lines of the table in CRP/2 covered trade policy courses organized in Geneva, which lasted for a period of 12 weeks. They were the main pillar of the training provided by the WTO Training Institute. The 19th training course, in English, had ended in April for the majority of the participants with the exception of those from the Commonwealth. The Training Institute and the Commonwealth Secretariat had organized two extra weeks of training for the participants from the Commonwealth. The 19th course had been immediately followed by the 20th course, in Spanish, which would end at the end of July. For the first time, the Training Institute would hold two parallel trade policy courses beginning in September 2002. Those would be held in English in the two new training rooms that were being built on the fourth floor of the WTO building. Line five and six of the table showed the WTO introduction courses for LDCs, which lasted for three weeks. The first such course given by the Institute had been held in English in March 2002. The programme and the training material had been updated and through a strengthening of cooperation with the International Trade Centre (ITC), a concrete hands-on approach had been used to attempt to address the specific interests of LDCs. That type of approach would be used for the second course in French to be held in November 2002. The third type of training involved the specialized courses on rules and procedures for dispute settlement, each lasting one week. Delegations were already familiar with those courses. The training programme and material for that activity, which was conducted with the cooperation of the Legal Affairs Division and the Secretariat of the Appellate Body, had been partially modified. The fourth element of training involved the WTO induction days which were mainly intended for new arrivals to Geneva. Two of those had already been carried out, one in February and one in May. A third one would be held in                                                                                    WT/COMTD/M/41                                                                                            Page 7 mid-September. The fifth element of training concerned the training of trainers. The first phase of the programme, launched in the spring would continue through the fall. The programme already seemed to be yielding fruitful results which related to a qualitative change in the approach to training carried out by the collaborators from the Secretariat. The second phase would take place near the end of the year and was currently being prepared by the Secretariat. That would enable the Secretariat to address the needs of its training partners in the developing countries themselves. He said that in the CTD Members had always said that the Secretariat had to improve the quality of trainers so that those following the training activities could benefit from the higher quality of the trainers' work. That type of activity only made sense if the training for trainers could be broadened to reach those in developing countries, so that there could be teams of trainers in the countries which were benefitting from the WTO training programmes.","WTCOMTDM41.pdf","Secretariat, Members, WTO, Geneva, Geneva, WTO, Training, Institute, Training, Institute, Commonwealth, Secretariat, Commonwealth, Training, Institute, WTO, WTO, Institute, ITC, Secretariat, WTO, Geneva, Secretariat, Secretariat, Secretariat, Members, Secretariat, WTO"
"4285",4285,"22","22.     The final point was with respect to item C(v) of the agenda on the 2003 Technical Assistance Plan. He recalled that the Secretariat had requested all delegations to forward their priority requests for 2003 to the Secretariat by 31 July 2002, so as to allow the WTO Secretariat to submit the draft 2003 Technical Assistance Plan immediately after the summer break. The 2003 Plan would be drafted in August. However, that depended entirely on delegations' inputs. He reminded Members, observers and international organizations of the initial announcement made at the Fortieth Session of the CTD on 25 April. The draft 2003 Technical Assistance Plan would be submitted to the CTD for authorisation in October 2002. A note on the financial implications of the 2003 Plan would be submitted to the BFA Committee in November 2002. A pledging conference would be held in December 2002/January 2003.","WTCOMTDM41.pdf","Secretariat, Secretariat, WTO, Secretariat, Members, CTD, CTD, BFA, Committee"
"4284",4284,"21","21.      The seventh point concerned the Doha Development Agenda Advanced Training Courses. He said he would revert to that at a later time when speaking on the training activities. Annex II of document CRP/1 showed where Members stood on the Advanced Training Courses for Trade Policy Officials. It was an undertaking that was considered in Annex I of the 2002 Technical Assistance Plan. The programme for those advanced training courses would be jointly delivered in a tri-party relationship between the WTO, Academic Centres of Excellence, Research Institutions, Policy Oriented Think Thanks, and Regional Development Banks. The first of those two-week courses had been organised in June 2002 in the Western Hemisphere with the collaboration of the Organisation of American States and Georgetown University to the benefit of Latin American Countries. Other courses would follow according to the plan that appeared in Annex II.","WTCOMTDM41.pdf","Doha, Development, Agenda, Advanced, Training, Courses, Members, WTO, Western, Hemisphere, Organisation, of, American, States, Georgetown, University"

"4281",4281,"19","19.     The fifth point related to Inter-Agency Cooperation. He said that despite the fact that the paragraph on inter-agency cooperation in document CRP/1 was short, cooperation was at the core of WT/COMTD/M/41 Page 6 the Secretariat's activities and was functioning efficiently both within the frameworks that had been set up with a number of inter-governmental organizations and on a day-to-day basis.","WTCOMTDM41.pdf","Secretariat"
"4280",4280,"18","18.     The fourth point related to the establishment of the Doha Development Agenda Database on Trade-Related Technical Assistance and Capacity-Building. He said that it was a joint exercise between the WTO and the Development Assistance Committee of the OECD and the idea was to set up a database that would answer the question of who did what. The database was based on matrices and its main unit was the ""country file"". The idea was to develop a matrix for each country consisting of lines containing the different technical assistance activities and columns showing which activity was undertaken by what agency in the field of trade related technical assistance. One important step had been to reach a common definition of those activities, and that work had already been completed. He said the work was going well and a demonstration of the main features of the database would be organised for the high-level meeting on technical assistance for senior officials on 16 July. There would also be a demonstration at the next Trade Negotiations Committee on 19 July.","WTCOMTDM41.pdf","Doha, Development, Agenda, Database, on, Trade-Related, Technical, Assistance, WTO, Development, Assistance, Committee, OECD, Committee"
"4279",4279,"17","17.     The third point covered the questions of mainstreaming trade through Ministerial trade conferences and experience had been gained with a trade ministers' Conference organised by the Inter-American Development Bank with the collaboration of the WTO in February 2002. That Conference showed a way to enhance the understanding of the concept of mainstreaming trade policies into global economic development policies in developing, developed and transition economies. He said that the Secretariat hoped to institutionalize that kind of format in partnership with the regional development banks he had mentioned. The WTO Secretariat would work with finance and trade ministries in various developing country regions to ensure that trade was, and continued to be, mainstreamed into development plans and strategies for poverty reduction. So far, two ministerial conferences involving trade and finance officials had been organised, one in Tbilisi, Georgia in May 2002 and the other in Zagreb, Croatia in June 2002.","WTCOMTDM41.pdf","Inter-American, Development, Bank, WTO, Secretariat, WTO, Secretariat, Tbilisi, Georgia, Zagreb, Croatia"
"4278",4278,"16","16.     The second point related to the cooperation with regional development banks. He said that the first meeting with heads of regional development banks had been convened by the Director-General on 3 May 2002 in Geneva. Participants in that meeting had reached an understanding to maintain the strategic partnership between the WTO and regional development banks as seen in Annex I of the conference room paper CRP/1. So far, collaboration had been formalised with the Arab Monetary Fund, the Asian Development Bank, the Inter-American Development Bank and the Islamic Development Bank. The Secretariat was currently working towards setting up the same kind of Memorandum of Understanding with other regional development banks, notably the African Development Bank.","WTCOMTDM41.pdf","Director-General, Geneva, WTO, Arab, Monetary, Fund, Asian, Development, Bank, Inter-American, Development, Bank, Islamic, Development, Bank, Secretariat, African, Development, Bank"
"4277",4277,"15","15.      The first point was about the implementation of the 2002 Technical Assistance Plan. What Members needed to keep in mind was that, as of 30 June, a total of 261 activities had been undertaken, including 185 planned activities. That was 36 per cent of the activities in the 2002 Technical Assistance Plan. There was a discrepancy between planned activities and activities actually implemented. That discrepancy was due to the ad-hoc requests. He said that he would not wish to enter into the discussion on ad-hoc versus planned activities. The number of ad-hoc requests were so substantial that it might prevent the Secretariat from having an efficient management policy. Ad-hoc activities went against sound management and obliged the Secretariat to take difficult decisions in order to fulfil the activities in due time. The Director General had recently taken the decision to recruit some professionals on yearly contracts to help the Secretariat deliver technical assistance activities. That should allow the Secretariat to keep to the Plan and enable it to present to Members, by the end of the year, an implementation ratio close to one hundred percent.","WTCOMTDM41.pdf","Members, Secretariat, Secretariat, Director, Secretariat, Secretariat, Members"
"4276",4276,"14","14.     Deputy Director-General Mr. Ravier said that the first conference room paper CRP/1, prepared by the Secretariat was circulated on 26 June, an extract of which was available for Members. That document intended to summarise the status of the implementation of the 2002 Technical                                                                                   WT/COMTD/M/41                                                                                           Page 5 Assistance Plan and covered a number of specific points on technical co-operation activities that had been raised by delegations during the last CTD meeting.

"4272",4272,"132","132.    The Chairman said that the delegation of Canada's statement referred to 48 LDCs, whereas there were 49 and he hoped that no particular LDC had been excluded.","WTCOMTDM41.pdf","Chairman, Canada"
"4271",4271,"131","131.    He gave the example of apparel imported from an LDC, which would qualify for duty free and quota free access if first, the apparel was assembled in that LDC; second, it was made from fabric cut or knit to shape in that same LDC; and third, if the fabric or yarn originated in that same LDC. Apparel cut and sewn in an LDC could also qualify if it used imported fabrics or yarns so long as first, WT/COMTD/M/41 Page 32 there was 25 per cent value added in the LDC in producing (cutting and sewing) the apparel; and second, the imported fabric or yarn originated in another LDC or a developing country. For fabric to be considered originating, it needed to be made from yarn produced in an LDC or developing country, and the yarn needed to be spun or extruded in the LDC or developing country. In short, the rules of origin for apparel would allow cumulation not just from other LDCs but also from developing countries, hence encouraging greater trade with developing countries as well as from Canada. To further ensure that the benefits went where they were intended, LDCs would be required to sign an undertaking to cooperate on the exchange of information for verification purposes. His Government would also be putting in place an enhanced and more targeted monitoring, verification and investigation regime on textiles and apparel. The purpose of that action was to deter illegal transhipments that would erode the benefits to LDCs. In addition to apparel, his Government extended the duty free and quota free regime for LDCs to also cover other products of key interest to those countries, including textiles and most agricultural products, as well as other industrial products. He said that more details would be provided in the fall as his Government prepared to implement its new duty free and quota free regime on 1 January 2003. He concluded by saying that his Government's new LDC market access initiative was far-reaching and designed to give LDCs preferential treatment in the products of key interest to them. His delegation would provide a notification on that new regime in due course.","WTCOMTDM41.pdf","LDC, LDC, Canada, LDCs"
"4270",4270,"130","130.    Another representative of Canada said that on 27 June 2002, Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chrétien announced that, effective from 1 January 2003, Canada would provide duty free and quota free access to imports from 48 of the world's LDCs for all products except dairy products, poultry and eggs. That action was being taken to help LDCs develop by increasing their opportunities to trade and by encouraging investment in those countries. His Government had received direct representations from LDCs to provide improved market access. A number of international organizations, including the WTO, IMF, the World Bank and the UN, had noted the benefits of granting greater market access to LDCs. Canada's LDC market-access initiative covered the major products of interest which those LDCs exported to Canada, including apparel which accounted for more than half of Canada's imports from LDCs. His Government was also developing new rules of origin and rules of origin procedures for textiles and apparel for those preferences. Those rules of origin were designed:                 (i)     to provide real opportunities and benefits that LDCs could realize by directly                         taking into account the production capacity of LDCs;                 (ii)    by allowing for accumulation, they extend benefits to developing countries,                         as well as LDCs, who produced inputs, such as yarn and fabric, that was used                         by LDCs to produce apparel and other finished textile products; and                 (iii)   to ensure that the benefits went to where they were intended while protecting                         against illegal transhipment and without imposing undue administrative                         burdens.","WTCOMTDM41.pdf","Canada, Jean, Chrétien, Canada, LDCs, WTO, IMF, World, Bank, UN, Canada, Canada, Canada"

The representative of Canada said that on 27 June 2002, the Canadian Prime Minister, Jean Chrétien had announced initiatives that her Government would take to support Africa's development, including enhanced market access, trade and investment, resources for good government, conflict prevention, education, health, agricultural research and water management. The announcements represented a commitment of Canadian $6 billion in new and existing resources over five years to Africa's development, including a Canadian $5 million Canada Fund for Africa that had been previously announced. The new initiatives would bring together governments, the private sector and civil society to promote African initiative, human development and critical infrastructure services. They would include public participation and capacity-building to develop African solutions to its challenges and were in complete alignment with the NEPAD and the G8 Africa Action Plan. There would be a Canadian $100 million programme to encourage private sector investment by creating an African investment fund which would support and leverage private sector resources for investment in infrastructure such as roads, water supply and pipeline construction. Canadian $20 million would be set aside for three new initiatives to increase Africa's trade capacity by working to promote exports within and outside Africa and to strengthen the role of African countries and institutions in the multilateral trading system. Those included Canadian $7 million, over three years to further the JITAP programme, $8 million over three years, to the ITC and the Trade Facilitation Office of Canada for a creative new programme of export promotion, and $5 million over three years to develop a trade policy expertise centre for Africa in partnership with the Economic Commission for Africa. There would also be Canadian $35 million for three initiatives to help bridge the digital divide by supporting African initiatives that expanded the use and benefits of new information and communications technologies.","WTCOMTDM41.pdf","Canada, Jean, Chrétien, Africa, Africa, Canada, Fund, for, Africa, Africa, Africa, ITC, Trade, Facilitation, Office, of, Canada, Africa, Economic, Commission, for, Africa"

"4266",4266,"127","127.     The Chairman said that delegations had a great deal of interest in the issue of e-commerce and had not had the opportunity to examine it in detail and consider the report. He therefore suggested that the Committee revert to the topic at the next CTD meeting.","WTCOMTDM41.pdf","Chairman, Committee, CTD"
"4265",4265,"126","126.     He continued by saying that as regards the issue of transfer of technology, one of the major barriers to the interests of developing countries was the non-availability of encryption technology. Developing countries faced special challenges and responsibilities to create a conducive policy environment that, on the one hand allowed for the development of e-commerce, and on the other ensured the social objective of providing access and benefits for those that could not afford it. If developing countries were to benefit from the new technological and economic boom which the growth of e-commerce represented, they would need to get access to technology and develop their infrastructure. His delegation reminded the CTD about the concerns raised by the developing countries regarding the non-operationlization of Article IV of the GATS. Article IV provided for the participation of developing countries, through enhanced market access in areas of export interest to them, and through better access to technology, including encryption technology and security of transactions and efficient telecommunication services. The existing restrictions on the export of state- of-the-art encryption technology by some Members was of particular concern to his delegation. The striking disparity between the developed and developing countries' capacity to engage in e-commerce, especially in terms of the infrastructure that was required, had to be central to Members' discussions. To address that disadvantage and to ensure a level playing field, a package of measures would have to be considered. That package could include access to, and transfer of, related technology such as the sharing of encryption and security technology to allow secure transactions. In addition mechanisms that facilitated the ability of developing country firms to engage in e-commerce were necessary. In that regard, there was a need for subsidized access to e-markets and assistance in the establishment of banking systems for all types of e-commerce transactions. He concluded by saying that standards related to various aspects of e-commerce should be formulated with the effective participation of developing countries. Such standards should not be complex and onerous to observe as that would act as a barrier to entry of developing country firms into e-commerce.","WTCOMTDM41.pdf","CTD, Members, Members"
"4264",4264,"125","125.    The representative of Pakistan said that his delegation attached great importance to the aspect of e-commerce in the work programme of the CTD. Most developing countries had little or no national experience, expertise or technical capacity in the field of e-commerce and thus had not fully analysed the possible and often unpredictable implications of its development in their economies and their societies. His delegation understood that in the present day world, e-commerce presented opportunities. However, it posed many threats to the economies of the developing countries and the LDCs along with those opportunities. In a world of a digital divide between the North and the South, there were many aspects of that particular mode of commerce which needed to be examined. In one WT/COMTD/M/41 Page 30 of the publications appearing in the International Herald Tribune, the Director General of the WTO had said that ""there are more internet connections in Singapore alone than that in all of Africa"". If the scenario was that two-thirds of humanity did not even have access to e-commerce, it seemed unjust and unfair to be talking about globalisation with respect to e-commerce. In that regard, his delegation was pleased with the work done by the CTD and hoped that the CTD would be able to examine issues in more depth and come up with concrete suggestions to the General Council which would lead to meaningful results. Though there was little doubt that e-commerce was an important issue for world trade, there were several aspects of it that needed to be further studied, especially from the point of view of its implications for the developing world. There were several impediments to the availability of and access to that medium in developing countries and unless those were addressed, the gap between the North and South and that between the poor and the rich would only widen. His delegation therefore suggested that the Committee deal with the issues of infrastructure, investment, availability of hardware and software, awareness, education and training when considering e- commerce. Developing countries needed to be given adequate time to thoroughly study the implications and the optimal ways of placing the internet and e-commerce in the service of development. The granting of S&D for developing countries with reference to the infrastructure development had to be duly considered by the CTD.","WTCOMTDM41.pdf","Pakistan, CTD, South, International, Herald, Tribune, Director, WTO, Singapore, Africa, CTD, CTD, General, Council, North, Committee, CTD"

That report was a useful source of information on the revenue implications of e-commerce.

Views had been expressed of how difficult that would be and he asked the Secretariat to inform Members about its efforts. He said that he raised that issue because he found it difficult to engage in a debate on the virtues of lowering some of the barriers or, as the delegation of India might say, ""loosening the strait jacket of Article XVIII"", because Members were still not certain how it would work and whether there were cases where it had already been used. He suggested that the minutes of the meeting should contain some answers on the experience which was available. It would be difficult for Members to have a hypothetical discussion without case studies, where for example, there was no possibility for Members to ask for concessions elsewhere or suspend concessions. His delegation's concern was that if Members were not aware of how that would operate, they might be creating a bigger loophole than even the proponents might want. He asked other delegations to reflect on how Members could make progress on that issue, and in particular whether they had experience of cases where the protection of an infant industry was not possible because of the restraints of Article XVIII.","WTCOMTDM41.pdf","European, Communities, CTD, Secretariat, Secretariat, Members, India, Members, Members, Members, Members, Members"

The representative of the United States reiterated that her delegation did not oppose dealing with Article XVIII in the CTD as long as it was clear that the CTD was handling over-arching aspects of the proposals and that its work was without prejudice to any view on which the WTO body would handle Article XVIII invocations. Her delegation believed that there was precedence in the BOP's Committee concerning Article XVIII:B and in the Council for Trade in Goods concerning Article XVIII:C. She asked if the delegation of India could make its statement available so that delegations could examine its details more carefully.3 It was faxed to all delegations on 10 July 2002. Her delegation was not persuaded that, at that time, a review of Article XVIII:A and C was warranted. However, her delegation was still prepared to listen and reflect on any views expressed, in light of what the representative of India had said. Members had spent a considerable amount of time on some of the issues before they had reached that stage and were now fulfilling the mandate of the Doha Implementation-Related Issues and Concerns. Her delegation's reflection would also be related to its concern with the implications of the proposal. The phrase ""with a view to ensure"" in Job 152 was particularly problematic to her delegation. Initiating a review based on past discussions would be of concern, especially when that would weaken existing obligations or predetermine the outcome.","WTCOMTDM41.pdf","United, States, CTD, CTD, WTO, BOP, Committee, India, India, Members, Doha"

She went on to say that her delegation's proposal (in document WT/GC/W/363) sought to ensure that for the purposes of paragraph 7(b) and 18(b) of Article XVIII, as the case might be, it should be sufficient for WTO Members, acting jointly, to concur in the proposed measure if they were satisfied that all reasonable efforts had been made by the concerned Member to reach an agreement with any relevant Member, without having to face the prospect of suspension of equivalent concession and/or retaliation. The mandate before the CTD was to conduct a complete review of Article XVIII, with the view to ensure that it served the original objective of facilitating the progressive development of economies in developing countries, and to allow them to implement the programmes and policies of economic development designed to raise the general living standards of their people. The proposal that she had outlined drew upon one set of issues in that context. Her delegation had also noted the proposals by the delegation of Saint Lucia (TN/CTD/W/8). Her delegation had in particular noted the need to clarify certain procedural ambiguities in Article XVIII:C, the need to interpret broadly the circumstances involving ""infant industries"" read along with the Addendum note to paragraphs 2, 3, 7, 13 and 22 of Article XVIII and the need to reconsider the concept of compensation and/or retaliation in order to make the provisions of Article XVIII effective, as well as to facilitate the implementation of sustainable economic development programmes in developing member countries. While the delegation of Saint Lucia had made those proposals in the Special Session of the CTD, her delegation had been working on similar issues. She hoped to concretize similar aspects related to the development of industries in developing members in the context of the current work in the regular sessions of the CTD and under implementation-related issues in the near future.","WTCOMTDM41.pdf","WTO, Members, Member, Member, CTD, Saint, Lucia, Saint, Lucia, CTD, CTD"
"4255",4255,"117","117.     The representative of India said that the implementation-related issues and concerns regarding the various WTO agreements had been raised by some developing countries in the run up to the Seattle and Doha Ministerial Conferences. Decisions on certain implementation concerns had been reached at the Doha Ministerial Conference, which were contained in the Doha Decision on Implementation-Related Issues and Concerns (WT/MIN(01)/17). Some implementation-related concerns remained outstanding and needed to be dealt with as per paragraph 12 of the Doha Ministerial Declaration. Paragraph 12(b) of the Doha Ministerial Declaration stated that ""the other outstanding implementation issues shall be addressed as a matter of priority by the relevant WTO bodies, which shall report to the Trade Negotiations Committee, established under paragraph 46 below, by the end of 2002 for appropriate action."" Ministers had agreed that negotiations on outstanding implementation issues should be an integral part of the work programme. Accordingly, her delegation drew Members attention to its earlier proposal on Article XVIII, sections A and C of GATT 1994 as contained in document WT/GC/W/363 dated 12 October 1999. She recalled that Article XVIII recognised the need for Members to take protective or other measures affecting imports in order to implement programmes and policies of economic development with the objective of raising the general standard of living. In that endeavour, additional facilities would be provided to enable them, inter alia, ""to maintain sufficient flexibility in their tariff structure to be able to grant the tariff protection required for the establishment of a particular industry"" and to take other specific measures effecting imports envisaged in Section C in the process of economic development. Article XVIII, sections A and C, also specified the procedure to be followed by a Member wishing to promote the establishment of a particular industry with a view to raising the general standard of living of its people. The underlying intention of those provisions was based on the recognition that WT/COMTD/M/41 Page 28 Members with limited resources might not, at all times, be able to rely exclusively on WTO consistent measures to deal with issues arising from the implementation of their programmes of economic development. While WTO Members, acting jointly, could under specific circumstances release the concerned Member from its obligations under the WTO Agreement to the extent necessary to apply that measure, the obligation of having to make additional concessions or face temporary suspension by other WTO Members of a substantially equivalent concession on account of an impairment due to the introduction of the measure in question, actually nullified the very intention of allowing developing countries to promote industrial development.","WTCOMTDM41.pdf","India, WTO, Seattle, Doha, Ministerial, Conferences, WTO, Trade, Negotiations, Committee, Members, GATT, Members, Member, Members, WTO, WTO, Members, Member, WTO, WTO, Members"
"4254",4254,"116","116.      The Chairman said that Article XVIII had been one of the issues discussed at the informal consultations which he had just referred to. He had concluded from those consultations that there had been no objection to deal with Article XVIII, apart from section B relating to balance-of-payments, as an outstanding implementation issue in the regular sessions of the CTD as long as it was without prejudice to work related to Article XVIII carried out elsewhere. The questions before the CTD were firstly, how it should deal with Article XVIII, excluding Section B, as an outstanding implementation issue; secondly, what delegations wished to get out of the consideration of it; and thirdly, what the goal with the reporting in December should be.","WTCOMTDM41.pdf","Chairman, CTD, CTD"

"4252",4252,"114","114.    The Chairman said that, at the last formal meeting of the CTD, Members had decided to keep item H as a standing item on the agenda. It had been decided that open-ended informal consultations be held on item H, including a proposal that had been made by the delegation of the European Communities for a process of tracking the developmental aspects of the negotiations and other WTO work. Those informal consultations had been held and it was clear that delegations required more time to consider all aspects of the topic, and needed time to react to the proposal made by the delegation of the European Communities. He had enquired at that Meeting if delegates felt that it would be fruitful to continue the informal consultations. Some delegations had expressed support for continuing the informal consultations. A few delegations had said that they wished to examine document WT/COMTD/W/99 – WT/CTE/W/208 - TN/TE/W/3 further. He also understood that the delegations which had not had the chance to consider it wished for an opportunity to do so. He proposed that informal consultations be held on the topic and that item H be kept on the agenda for the next meeting of the CTD.","WTCOMTDM41.pdf","Chairman, CTD, Members, WTO, CTD"

The representative of the European Communities clarified that the question of subsidies was part of scenario number three, the liberalization scenario, which was based on the assumption that all forms of export subsidies, domestic support measures, and import duties would be abolished. The effects on rural development were also taken into account. The first paragraph on page 21 of his delegation's submission considered the issue of rural women in the agricultural sector. The third paragraph considered small-scale farmers and the rural poor in general. He said that he would not go into that in more detail, but he wished to ensure that all the elements had been put on the table.

His delegation would have to look at the document (WT/COMTD/W/99 – WT/CTE/W/208 - TN/TE/W/3) in greater detail. There were some elements that were inherent to constraints of the study, as the paper itself recognised. Some elements, as stated by the representative of Argentina, had not been included in the analysis and there were some indications which pointed to certain concerns as to how the methodology had been developed.","WTCOMTDM41.pdf","Chile, Argentina"

He said that his delegation had concerns with respect to some of the aspects of the document. There was no mention of the impact of rural development in developing countries, and the way in which the high level of subsidies in some developed countries could disturb investment flows in rural zones of developing countries and the poorest zones of those countries. His delegation had expressed its non-trade concerns about the lack of trade liberalization in agriculture in CTE document (WT/CTE/W/138). It had also been presented in the first stage of the negotiations in agriculture (under document symbol G/AG/NG/W/88). Another concern was the lack of any mention of the dependence caused by food export subsidies on which the MERCOSUR and other Members had presented a document (G/AG/NG/W/38) under phase 1. His delegation noted that there were some omissions in the document WT/COMTD/W/99 – WT/CTE/W/208 - TN/TE/W/3 and it would continue studying the submission.","WTCOMTDM41.pdf","Argentina, CTD, MERCOSUR, Members"

Those were issues on which her delegation had expressed the wish to make additional comments.

Her delegation's support for the DDAGTF was in addition to the AITIC contribution of AUD500,000 and the successful delivery of a trade policy training course for African trade negotiators which was run in cooperation with the Government of South Africa in May 2002. That training course was delivered to 25 participants from 16 African countries including seven LDCs and two WTO non-resident Members. Her Government would provide AUD25 million of trade-related technical assistance during the 2002-2003 financial year. Overall, her delegation was pleased with the implementation of the 2002 Technical Assistance Plan including the advanced training courses for Government Officials and activities of the WTO Training Institute. Her delegation commended the Secretariat on the transparency of its reporting process. She trusted that the ongoing reporting provided would assist the Secretariat and the Membership to fine tune the 2003 Plan, thereby allowing the WTO technical assistance strategy to be continually improved. Her delegation was especially appreciative of the work being done with other organizations, particularly the regional development banks. She requested information on three points so as to clarify the situation and to possibly identify areas where Members could make a contribution to the process. Those included the types of assistance being provided on an ad-hoc basis, the level of response to the call for requests for technical assistance in 2003, and the issues that the WTO was having problems resolving with other agencies. It was in the interest of all WTO Members to make the technical assistance strategy as effective and efficient as possible. Her delegation would be happy to look at ways of making that possible, including through action in other organizations.","WTCOMTDM41.pdf","Australia, Committee, South, Africa, WTO, Members, WTO, Training, Institute, Secretariat, Secretariat, WTO, Members, WTO, WTO, Members"
"4246",4246,"109","109.    The representative of the European Communities said that the main purpose of submitting that document was to ensure that Members were aware that it existed. His delegation believed that Members needed to seriously consider what was in the Doha Ministerial Declaration about WT/COMTD/M/41 Page 26 encouraging voluntary sustainability impact assessment. To be precise on what that could mean, his delegation had provided two documents, one was on the methodology that had been used by the European Communities. The methodology was important in terms of the type of assessment in question. The second part provided an example of how an assessment could be done, considering some sectors and some products. He urged Members to read the introductions as well as the methodologies and case studies, as they would give an idea of what his delegation was doing. Further information was available on the website http://idpm.man.ac.uk/sia-trade as indicated in the covering letter in WT/COMTD/W/99 – WT/CTE/W/208 - TN/TE/W/3. The studies and especially with respect to the question of major crops, warranted a closer look. He urged Members to look at that in order to see whether they also considered it an interesting exercise. His delegation was in favour of more work on paragraph 51. He referred to the minutes of the last meeting where Members had set the ideas of a tracking exercise in the CTD. His delegation had listened to the reactions in the informal meeting and still believed that it would be useful to have some kind of comprehensive overview, in one document, which would allow Members to see where they were on the ""Development"" part of the DDA agenda.","WTCOMTDM41.pdf","European, Communities, Members, Members, Members, Members, Members, CTD, Members, DDA"

He therefore proposed that the item be kept on the agenda and that document WT/COMTD/W/100 be discussed at the next meeting. The Secretariat would make a revision of the paper with more desegregated data as had been requested by the delegation of Paraguay.","WTCOMTDM41.pdf","Chairman, Members, Secretariat, Paraguay"

The representative of the European Communities said that Members might have to revert back to the document (WT/COMTD/W/100) at the next meeting as delegations would then have had more time to study it. His delegation found the document interesting and some of the trends that had been identified might warrant an in depth discussion. The representative of the United States had already alluded to some of them when mentioning the relationship between high technology and commodity exports, the problem of commodity prices, the disparities among developing countries and the value of regional integration. He said that Charts 1 to 4 of the Annex were intriguing in showing the progress that some countries had made in reducing their dependency on primary products, while others had not been able to do so. If that was coupled with the actual growth of GDP or exports it would probably be more significant. His delegation looked forward to a deeper discussion along the themes he had just indicated.","WTCOMTDM41.pdf","European, Communities, Members, United, States"
"4242",4242,"105","105.     The representative of Paraguay said that document WT/COMTD/W/100 contrasted to the report presented by UNCTAD and that WTO Members therefore could reflect upon both documents. His delegation found the document useful with respect to the information it contained on the trends, evolution and increase in the industrial production of developing countries as well as their exports of industrial products. His delegation also noted a slight improvement in some regions or in some countries. He requested that the Secretariat carry out a more detailed analysis with respect to the participation of developing countries, in referring specifically, for example, to a region such as Latin America which contained both giant industrial countries and other less industrially developed countries. The information did not reflect the realities of all countries in one region when the two types of countries were merged into one regional image. His delegation asked the Secretariat to issue a revision of the document providing a breakdown of the information by region, including for example more details on the Asian, African, Latin American and Caribbean regions.","WTCOMTDM41.pdf","Paraguay, UNCTAD, WTO, Members, Secretariat, Latin, America, Secretariat, Caribbean"
"4241",4241,"104","104.     The representative of the United States said that the type of analysis provided by the Secretariat in preparing the document WT/COMTD/W/100, helped inform Members' discussions and provided useful insight. One aspect of the report that her delegation found not worthy was that countries that diversified into higher technology sectors, from exporting only primary products, had increased their participation in global trade in the longer term. According to the WTO Secretariat Report, world exports were correlated with the level of technology. The highest growth rates were recorded in the high technology category, accounting for more than a quarter of world exports in the year 2000. The lowest overall growth rate of 3.2 per cent was recorded in primary products. Her delegation particularly appreciated the fact that the Secretariat had provided both regional and country level analysis to reflect the wide range of participation of Members. Among the points highlighted was the fact that some Members had had greater success in increasing their participation in the trading system than others. The report also highlighted the well known success of Asian economies such as China; Hong Kong, China; Chinese, Taipei; The Republic of Korea and Singapore; and their increasing share in global trade. China had become the fourth largest trader in the world. In addition, there were other regions that had experienced some growth in trade. The Secretariat report also mentioned dynamic exporters including                                                                                    WT/COMTD/M/41                                                                                           Page 25 some Members from other geographic regions whose merchandise exports had increased by more than 10 per cent annually. In future reports, her delegation would be interested to learn more from the Secretariat and Members about other relevant factors, domestic and others, that assisted countries in increasing their participation in the global trading system.","WTCOMTDM41.pdf","United, States, Secretariat, Members, WTO, Secretariat, Secretariat, Members, Members, China, Hong, Kong, China, Taipei, The, Republic, of, Korea, Singapore, China, Secretariat, Members, Secretariat, Members"

With respect to the ceiling quotas for industrial products for LDCs, he said that his Government had already achieved almost 100 per cent duty-free and quota-free treatment for LDCs. Therefore, he did not believe that each of the items listed on pages 2 to 5 of WT/COMTD/N/2/Add.11 affected the imports from LDCs. Only page 6 of WT/COMTD/N/2/Add.11 had a quota which related to a couple of LDCs. There was a detailed description with respect to the ceiling quotas for the items listed on pages 2 to 5 of WT/COMTD/N/2/Add.11 which related to the first come first served scheme. For instance, where one of the exporting country's exceeded a certain percentage of a whole quota then it reached the ceiling for that country.","WTCOMTDM41.pdf","Japan"

"4215",4215,"90","90.      The representative of the European Communities said that he wished to present some preliminary ideas of how to deal with paragraph 51 and he encouraged other delegations to consider the issue. His delegation believed that it was a potentially useful paragraph in the Doha Development WT/COMTD/M/40 Page 22 Agenda as it would allow delegations to have focussed debates on one of the main overall objectives of the Doha Development Agenda. The question was where to start and how to make the work systematic and useful. His delegation had presented some ideas in the CTE. Those ideas had not been very structured and might have been too ambitious. The first reaction from other delegations had been to go slow and to think about them further. What his delegation wished to discuss was the idea of starting off modestly by providing a basis for how work could proceed. That had led his delegation to realize that if any delegate was asked how far the work on the development dimension of the Doha Ministerial Declaration had progressed, it would be difficult to respond. That delegate would have to ask his colleagues dealing with other bodies what they were doing in their respective bodies, under what items they spoke about development, and how work was progressing. Because of that difficulty his delegation suggested some kind of a tracking exercise or all comprehensive exercise to identify progress in various bodies, focalised and centralised in the CTD. Some sort of score board or document that the WTO Secretariat would collect in interaction with the various bodies. A state of play to regularly monitor what happened with respect to development in other bodies. It would be one single paper which would regularly be updated which showed what actually was going on with respect to development, containing short paragraphs of what happened with respect to the IF, TA, S&D, the Working Group on Trade, Debt and Finance, Transfer of Technology, Small Economies, and the Sub-Committee on LDCs for example. This paper did not have to be very detailed but should allow delegations to see the ongoing work in a comprehensive way. He asked other delegations whether they thought that it would be useful for the CTD to ask the Secretariat to consider and explore the idea and suggest the approach to be taken. His delegation believed that it would allow delegations to be more specific and to identify themes for focussed discussions on individual items when it became clear how and where progress was being made. That exercise might also be useful for providing the public at large with an idea of what happened with respect to development in the WTO. The round was called the Doha Development Agenda and delegations had to be able to respond to the question of what progress was being made with respect to development. His delegation's proposal was meant to be a tool to assist in that respect by providing a concise assessment through a continuous tracking exercise throughout the negotiations and during the execution of work programmes. Without asking for an immediate decision, he asked for other delegations' reactions.","WTCOMTDM40.pdf","European, Communities, Doha, Development, Agenda, CTD, WTO, Secretariat, TA, S&D, Working, Group, on, Trade, CTD, Secretariat, WTO, Doha, Development, Agenda"
"4214",4214,"9","9.       His second point concerned the implementation of the 2002 Technical Assistance Plan. Implementation of the Plan was progressing at a reasonable rhythm even if it was somewhat slower than the Secretariat wished. As of 25 April 2002, a total of 150 activities had been undertaken, totalling 23 per cent of planned activities. That was somewhat below the expected rate as the date of 25 April corresponded to approximately one third of the year. However, with the filling of the WTO Secretariat positions opened in the L-series which would be recruited according to a fast-track procedure, the Secretariat would be able to step up the delivery of TA activities in the second half of the year and be better equipped to meet the ambitious targets established in the 2002 TA Plan. The Secretariat had been invited by Members in the Negotiating Group on Non-Agricultural Market Access, and the Working Group on Trade and Investment to report on TA activities underway and those envisaged, and how they would contribute to the ongoing negotiations and the different work programmes. Members of those bodies had expressed a reasonable degree of satisfaction with WTO TA. The rate of implementation was critically dependent on the extent to which beneficiary countries provide fixed, reliable dates for activities to be delivered in their countries. Frequently, dates were not given on time, and scheduled dates were moved, dislocating the timely delivery of planned activities.","WTCOMTDM40.pdf","Secretariat, WTO, Secretariat, Secretariat, Secretariat, Members, Working, Group, on, Trade, and, Investment, Members, WTO"

The Committee on Trade and Environment (CTE) had already decided to keep paragraph 51 as a standing item on the Agenda. At the last regular session of the CTE, delegations had had the opportunity to come forward with ideas as to how to approach the issue. It had then been suggested that the CTE have a first exchange of views on the matter at its October 2002 meeting. Some delegations had indicated that they considered it premature to discuss Paragraph 51 at the current stage of the negotiations. Further informal consultations would be held in the CTE. The CTD also had to deal with the subject, in accordance with the decision in paragraph 51. He sought Members' views on how they wished to proceed with that directive from Ministers.","WTCOMTDM40.pdf","Chairman, Committee, on, Trade, and, Development, Committee, on, Trade, and, Environment, Committee, on, Trade, and, Environment, CTE, CTE, CTE, CTD, Members"

Mr. Patrick Low, Director of the Development and Economic Research Division said that, the International Conference on Financing for Development had been held on 18-22 March 2002 in Monterrey, Mexico, where the ""Monterrey Consensus"" had been adopted. The Monterrey Conference had marked the first quadri-partite exchange of views between governments, civil society, the business community, and institutional stakeholders on global economic issues, and key financial and development issues. The Monterrey Concensus document, addressed six main themes: (i) domestic resource mobilization in developing countries; (ii) the role of private capital flows; (iii) the role of trade; (iv) international development cooperation, including the role of Official Development Assistance (ODA); (v) debt; and (vi) ""systemic issues"" relating to the framework of international cooperation on economic, financial and developmental questions. The document highlighted the importance of trade and recognized that in many cases, trade was ""the single most important external source of development financing"". The statement by the Director-General to the conference, which spelt out his views on the importance of trade in a broader development context, had been made available on the WTO website. In a section of the Monterrey Consensus document entitled ""Staying Engaged"", all stakeholders had been urged to participate actively in the follow-up to the Conference. The discussions at the Conference on poverty reduction, development and coherence were being seen as part of a process which started with the UN Millennium Summit, had been advanced by the WTO Doha Ministerial Decisions, and was to be continued with the World Summit on Sustainable Development, scheduled to be held in Johannesburg, South Africa, in late August/early September 2002. The Sustainable Development Summit, was also being seen by some as an opportunity to have an early stock-taking of the results of the Monterrey Conference and effectiveness in carrying out the operational aspects of the Monterrey Consensus.

Her delegation observed that sections A and C of Article XVIII, and Section 4(a) specifically, were limited to economies which could only support low standards of living and were in the early states of development.

The Chairman said that in paragraph 1.1 of the Decision on Implementation-Related Issues and Concerns (WT/MIN(01)17), Ministers had reaffirmed that:          ""… Article XVIII of the GATT 1994 is a special and differential treatment provision         for developing countries and that recourse to it should be less onerous than to         Article XII of the GATT 1994."" The need to revisit Article XVIII was originally recognized in tiret three of Job(01)/152/Rev.1 of 27 October 2001 which stated that:         ""A complete review of Article XVIII shall be undertaken with a view to ensure that it         subserves the original objective of facilitating the progressive development of         economies in developing countries and to allow them to implement programmes and         policies of economic development designed to raise the general standard of living of         their people."" Tiret 1 of the same document (Job(01)/152/Rev.1) stated that:         ""only the Committee on Balance-of-Payments shall have the authority to examine the         overall justification of BOP measures."" He said that it was his understanding that the Committee on Balance-of-Payments was considering section B of Article XVIII and would report to the General Council at the end of the year 2002.

"4187",4187,"65","65.     The representative of the European Communities said that his delegation was one of those which had underlined the need for more coherence and improved evaluation of WTO TC. It was not a coincidence that one of the European Communities' Member States had taken the initiative to pay for much of the preliminary work of the Technical Cooperation Audit. His delegation therefore remained attached to that exercise. He noted that the basis for the audit had been nine projects and forty back-to-office reports. His delegation would appreciate it if the basis would be broader the second time. However, it was a good start. A more in depth analysis of some of the issues involved would be helpful in the next report. For example, paragraphs 17 and 21 dealt with the important question of demand-drivenness and objectives. His delegation found it worrying that paragraph 17 stated that WT/COMTD/M/40 Page 18 ""Members are on the whole receptive to discussing with the Secretariat priority areas and other details based on the Secretariat's experience"". That did not correspond to his delegation's mainstreaming dogma which was firmly established and which stipulated that measures planned and objectives set should be part of the overall development strategies of the beneficiaries. His delegation would be pleased if more could be done to deepen that important preliminary step before other measures were taken. The question of sustainability had been highlighted by other delegation. It would be a key point to follow up on to see how difficult it might be to measure success, track the impact and see how WTO TA could be improved. More than ever after the Doha Ministerial Conference and the commitments made there, Members were under pressure to live up to the TA commitments made and had to ensure that the activities were effective. The report of the TCA would help delegations answer the question whether the TC provided had been effective or not. He therefore encouraged the Secretariat to continue on the chosen track.","WTCOMTDM40.pdf","European, Communities, WTO, TC, European, Communities, Member, Technical, Cooperation, Audit, Members, Secretariat, Secretariat, WTO, Doha, Ministerial, Conference, Members, TA, TCA, Secretariat"
"4186",4186,"64","64.      The representative of Switzerland said that his delegation did not consider the auditing mechanism and such reports as instruments for criticizing those providing TA, but as a means of learning and improving the TA provided. The recommendations of the TCA seemed useful and his delegation expected that they be seriously taken into consideration and that there would be follow-up upon them. Mr. Rolian had provided a comprehensive overview and had outlined the main findings. However, he said that four aspects were of particular importance to his delegation. The first was the need to set clear objectives for the various groups of TA. Close dialogue with the beneficiaries could assist in setting such objectives. As a second point, his delegation would welcome continued efforts in defining the tasks of, and the interface between, the operational divisions and the TC Division. His third point was that the selection of the participants in the different courses was crucial. Increased attention had to be given to that aspect, both by the Secretariat and by the beneficiary countries. It might help to analyze the reason why participants in the Trade Policy Courses seemed to remain longer in the trade area than participants in other courses. Collaboration between the WTO and agencies specialized in networking, such as the International Centre for Sustainable Development (ICSTD), might therefore be helpful. As the fourth point he said that his delegation supported the ideas mentioned in the last chapter of the report under the heading ""Lessons Learned"", although his delegation was aware that they were not easy to implement. However, some reflection on them was worthwhile. That included the suggestion that expanding the duration of the seminars at the expense of reducing the overall number of seminars, would, in the long run, prove beneficial for all. Given the Doha Work Programme and the pressing need for TA related to it, it was probably not something which could be done in 2002 or 2003. Nevertheless, it should be kept in mind for the future.","WTCOMTDM40.pdf","Switzerland, TCA, Rolian, TC, Division, Secretariat, WTO, Doha, Work, Programme"
"4185",4185,"63","63.      Much had been done in 2002 as well that would have an impact on TA activities; the preparation of an annual plan specifically tied to the Doha Development Agenda, and a pledging conference that had produced commitments almost double those of previous years, would have an impact on TA activities, was would the onset of mandated negotiations. But that was for future reports.","WTCOMTDM40.pdf","Doha, Development, Agenda"
"4184",4184,"62","62.     He went on to say that the third main point that the report drew to the attention of the Committee concerned some of the observations made and the lessons learned during the first year of operation.        (a)     The first of those was that over all, the quality of execution of WTO's TA was high.                It was not just the Auditor who said that; it had been confirmed consistently in                feedback from participants and in consultations with representatives of beneficiary                Members. WTO staff were on top of that aspect of their work, professional in their                approach and dedicated to what they were doing. It was worth recalling in that                connection that most of them were not hired for their skills in delivering TA, and that                in the period under review the pressure on them of competing work priorities                remained high.        (b)     The second observation was that making TA successful called for a cooperative effort                between the WTO Secretariat (providers) and Members (beneficiaries). That                cooperation could take several forms, from purely practical ones – pre-activity                logistics, meeting room arrangements, security, back-office assistance, hospitality,                etc. – to more substantive issues relating, for example, to the selection of participants                in WTO TA activities. Appropriate selection of those who would participate in                training activities meant that those activities would have a greater chance of                producing substantive results than they would otherwise. In a demand- and Member-                driven context, the selection of participants was obviously a matter for Members, but                they could and do enhance the impact of TA activities when they ensured that those                who participated really were concerned in their day-to-day work by the issues under                discussion, and were likely to remain in the trade business. More outreach to sectors                other than government also turned out to be a factor which adds value to TA.        (c)     Third, TCA had observed that there was a need for the Secretariat to continue to                focus on what was termed ""upstream"" activities, namely analysis of the needs of                Members and design of TA. For example, the report made the point that a simple                thing, such as clearly setting out the objective that was being sought in a given                activity or cluster of activities, should be an automatic step in planning for TA. The                identification of needs could rely on more than just the input from Members; TPR                reports, the work of Committees, and cooperation with other agencies might also be                factored in. Thinking about objectives had to begin early in the process of                determining the programme of activities. The DDA and the strategy for TA would be                helpful in that respect.        (d)     Fourth, with regard to sustainability, which was the most difficult aspect to evaluate,                there had been confirmation that the value of TA was enhanced when beneficiaries                recognised that they had more than a passive stake in the process. The success of TA                activities over the longer term would depend on factors such as the following:                (i)     beneficiary governments had national strategies that ensured that participants                        and other stake holders gained maximum benefit from WTO TA;                (ii)    beneficiaries continued with their own capacity-building activities even after                        WTO TA had ended, in order to consolidate and extend the results;                                                                                    WT/COMTD/M/40                                                                                           Page 17                 (iii)   beneficiaries took steps to ensure that WTO TA activities were extended                         beyond the immediate recipients to other government and non-governmental                         actors in the national context.         (e)     Fifth, at almost every TA activity that TCA had attended, remarks had been made                 concerning the fact that the WTO type of assistance addressed only one aspect of the                 trade capacity deficit faced by developing countries, and in particular by LDCs.                 Those remarks echoed those that had been made also in the Committee. Having a                 fuller understanding of the Agreements and rules underpinning the multilateral                 trading system was important, but so was having concretely the possibility of taking                 advantage of the opportunities that were beckoning, or at least overcoming the main                 obstacles to trading more. While TA evaluation had not focussed particularly on that                 aspect, it would be interesting to observe the extent to which, for example, the idea of                 mainstreaming WTO policy into national policy, and the IF programme could                 constitute a response to that concern that was so deeply felt.","WTCOMTDM40.pdf","Committee, WTO, Members, WTO, WTO, Secretariat, Members, WTO, Member, Members, TCA, Secretariat, Members, Members, TPR, DDA, WTO, WTO, WTO, TCA, WTO, Committee, WTO"
"4183",4183,"61","61.      He continued by saying that his second point concerned the question of methodology. From 1999, work had begun on the development of a monitoring and evaluation system for WTO TA, with the assistance of a consultant. That work had been promising but had been abandoned before being completed when the consultant left the Organization. When the TCA had been established, action had therefore been taken to revamp the function of TA monitoring and evaluation. In doing so, due account had been taken of the work that had been carried out prior to February 2001, as had been the high priority given to TA by Members and the TA Strategy adopted by the Committee. The main conceptual work had therefore been the development of a methodology for the evaluation of WTO's TA, to reflect the specific nature of that assistance. He acknowledged the contribution made by the Department for International Development of the UK Government, which had sponsored that work through a dedicated trust fund. The methodology that had been approved by the Director-General was briefly outlined in paragraphs 9 to 14 of the report, but the full methodology, which was in the Director-General's Notice to Staff (OFFICE(02)/40), had been distributed to Members as well. In relation to the methodology, three observations could be made:         (a)     The WTO's TA portfolio consisted of a large number of activities (around 400 in                 2001 and over 500 in 2002) almost exclusively in the form of training and                 capacity-building, which were of short duration and covered a great number of                 different topics, i.e. they were fragmented.         (b)     Because WTO TA was of that nature, the more common forms of evaluation                 methodology had not been found to be entirely relevant. One of the most challenging                 aspects of evaluation in the WTO context was to establish yardsticks for measuring                 long-term impact. The methodology addressed both that aspect and what had been                 called process aspects, for which criteria of success were easier to determine in terms                 of long-term sustainability.         (c)     The resources devoted to evaluation were limited in relation to the number of                 activities that had to be covered. That was why the methodology envisaged a shared                 responsibility between the Technical Cooperation Audit and the providers of TA.                 Inevitably, most of WTO's TA would be the subject of self-evaluation by the                 providers themselves, and the methodology went into some detail in setting out the                 framework for such self-evaluation. The fact of the matter was that without self-                 evaluation, if only the resources of the TCA were to be used, the basis for drawing WT/COMTD/M/40 Page 16                any conclusions about WTO TA would simply be insufficient. The role of TCA                would be inter alia to conduct evaluations on a broader basis, bringing together                information and drawing lessons from the self-evaluations and from its own, more                generic studies.","WTCOMTDM40.pdf","WTO, TA, TCA, Members, TA, Strategy, Committee, WTO, Department, for, International, Development, UK, Director-General, Director-General, Members, WTO, WTO, WTO, Technical, Cooperation, Audit, WTO, TCA, WTO, TCA"
"4182",4182,"60","60.      Mr. Paul Rolian, Director of the WTO Technical Cooperation Audit said that the CTD had before it in document WT/COMTD/W/97 the first annual report of the Technical Cooperation Audit. The report covered the period from February 2001, when the function had been created, to 31 December 2001. Judging from the repeated references that had been made by Members to the                                                                                    WT/COMTD/M/40                                                                                           Page 15 importance of a system of evaluation for the WTO TA programme, that report responded to a real need that had been identified by Members. He hoped that the report could serve as a basis for discussion and guidance from Members both for future TA activities and for the evaluation thereof. He would confine his introductory remarks to highlighting three main points. The first concerned the context or, the background. The report recalled that the year 2001 had been a year of transition. Not only was it the year in which the evaluation function had been established, in response to Members' clearly expressed desire, but it had also been the year, in October, in which the strategy for WTO TA had been debated and approved in the CTD, giving a new direction to that aspect of the WTO's work. Reflecting those changes, the Technical Cooperation Division had been reorganized and had absorbed the unit dealing with the IF and LDCs. The Training Division had been renamed the Training Institute and given an expanded mandate. A TAMC had been created as had a focal point in each Division, responsible for TA matters. Some 400 TA activities, more than ever before, had been carried out. That was also the year that saw an end to the debate that had not entirely subsided as to whether TA was or was not a core function of the Organization. Certainly, the Doha Development Agenda could leave no doubt that it was. As the report pointed out, those developments were not merely of academic interest. In the absence of agreement on the legitimacy of TA as part of the mandate of the WTO, it would have been difficult to conduct a strategically coherent programme of TA, and even to evaluate it.","WTCOMTDM40.pdf","Paul, Rolian, Director, WTO, Technical, Cooperation, Audit, CTD, Members, WTO, Members, Members, Members, WTO, CTD, WTO, Technical, Cooperation, Division, LDCs, Training, Institute, TAMC, Doha, Development, Agenda, WTO"

"4176",4176,"55","55.      Mr. Claude Mercier, Director, the WTO Training Institute said that numerous fruitful contacts had been maintained with a large number of academic institutions, both in developed and in developing countries. The Training Institute was in the process of finalizing a strategy as the large number of contacts required adequate responses within the means at the disposal of the Institute. The various parameters that would guide the institute in its contacts with other institutions were being finalized. The main emphasis was on academic institutions in developing and developed countries which had strong collaboration networks of contacts and cooperation with developing countries. The WTO Training Institute had not been able to move faster in that respect as that activity was not funded. It was the only activity which had been left out of the budget and the Doha Development Fund. His small team was doing its best with the means available. It was anticipated that the networking with universities would at some stage overlap with the training of trainers programme. It was unavoidable that links would have be made with established learning institutions as the passing on of knowledge was the basic concept of the training of trainers programme. The university networking would link to activities such as the training of trainers but also to the distance learning Internet-based courses. The second phase of the training of trainers would be a more complex one than the first one. The first step was to train the WTO personnel to improve their training delivery and design capacity. It was in that respect mostly a presentation skills course. Phase two included training officials from governments and possibly universities to become trainers. They should acquire the same presentation skills. However, that presupposed that the ""trainers to be"" already were experts in WTO matters. Phase two was thus both presentation skills training and training in presenting the content of the WTO Agreements in a better way. Instead of the three-day training provided to WTO staff, they would receive a more than two week, or even longer, training. The plan of how to go about the second phase was still under consideration. One decision that had to be taken was whether to bring the participants to Geneva or whether there would be training in the regions or the countries. Another element under consideration was to use the former participants in the regular training programmes who had since been based in capitals. As they already knew much about the WTO, they were ideal trainers. The aim was to have a definitive plan at the end of 2002. The Secretariat would be able to say more about it at the July or October meetings of the Committee. There had been a WT/COMTD/M/40 Page 14 question regarding fellowships and if the WTO would continue to grant them. He was happy to confirm that that was the case as the fellowships came under the regular budget. The regular budget had even provided for an increase in fellowships, in addition to the more stable and sustainable financing. The regular activities did not yet include the recent initiative of the Director-General for regional courses in Nairobi and Rabat. Those were to be financed separately and they had not been included in the regular budget or the Global Trust Fund. There was no change in the policy with respect to the granting of the regular fellowships. Regarding distance learning and the participation in the pilot phase, he said that a group of between 60 and 65 people had been selected from former training course participants and other colleagues in capitals who had offered to help adjust and improve the distance learning programme. An assessment was to be made after the six weeks. It was a new activity and the WTO wished to do it well. The software and the user-friendliness of the material had to be tested. That was why the Institute proceeded with an initial pilot project before it was expanded. The first real course would be launched in the fall of 2002. How to select the participants for that course would have to be decided. However, the number of potential beneficiaries from that kind of activity would be limited only by the number of tutors that could be guaranteed at the WTO, as the programme was based on two-way communication. The participants had to have access to a tutor at the WTO or elsewhere, e.g., professors at a university. Ultimately, all developing countries would be touched by the programme. As to the university networking, a number of ideas had been received following the request by the Director General for places where training could be carried out. There had been responses from Latin America, various parts of Asia, the South Pacific region and central and eastern European countries as well as from Arab countries. The potential was there but the Training Institute had only begun to look at them and what would become the overall policy of networking with universities. At the moment, the main effort was focussed on organizing, at short notice, the two courses in Africa in the summer of 2002. On another matter, he recalled that the second joint course between the WTO Training Institute and the Commonwealth Secretariat had recently been held. It was a special programme of two weeks held at the end of the three-month training course. The participants seemed to have enjoyed the specific, tailor-made programme. Lastly, the question of whether regional organizations would be invited to the courses in Rabat and Nairobi had not yet been considered.","WTCOMTDM40.pdf","Claude, Mercier, Director, WTO, Training, Institute, Training, Institute, Institute, WTO, Training, Institute, Doha, Development, Fund, WTO, WTO, WTO, WTO, Geneva, WTO, Secretariat, Committee, WTO, Director-General, Nairobi, Rabat, Global, Trust, Fund, WTO, Institute, WTO, WTO, Director, Latin, America, Asia, South, Pacific, Training, Institute, Africa, WTO, Training, Institute, Commonwealth, Secretariat, Rabat, Nairobi"

"4174",4174,"53","53.      Deputy Director General Mr. Ravier said that what he had presented was a list of activities of the Training Institute. Those activities were in the process of being profoundly renewed, diversified and extended. The aim was to have an Institute which could provide a large range of activities in order to respond to Members' varying needs. One of those was the cooperation with universities. That was the fastest growing area of the Training Institute's activities and the area which would develop the most in the near future. One of the reasons for the creation of the more independent Training Institute was to facilitate a deepened cooperation with universities. There were almost daily contacts between the WTO Training Institute and various other training institutions and universities which asked to collaborate with the WTO Training Institute. One of the current tasks of the Training Institute was to see how to build the network with all those institutions. The idea was to have contacts with institutions all over the world.","WTCOMTDM40.pdf","Director, Ravier, Training, Institute, Members, Training, Institute, Training, Institute, WTO, Training, Institute, WTO, Training, Institute, Training, Institute"

There was an example from the recent training course where, after the training course, there had been a meeting with some representatives and the Commonwealth Secretariat to discuss how the training could apply to their countries. Cooperation with other organizations would provide participants with more in-depth knowledge of the issues covered in the training courses. He encouraged further such cooperation and agreed with the delegation of the European Communities about the usefulness of cooperation between the WTO Secretariat and the academic community, in particular in developing countries, as mentioned in paragraph 13.

His delegation wished to hear more about progress in that respect. He encouraged the Secretariat to cooperate as closely as possible with the established institutions in the countries concerned who had the specific knowledge required in training when implementing the new training-related activities.

His second comment concerned coordination between the Training Institute's activities and the technical cooperation activities carried out by other divisions of the Secretariat. He pointed out that a TAMC had been established in June 2001. That body was currently in operation, providing a link between all the Divisions engaged in technical cooperation and training. The activities of the Training Institute WT/COMTD/M/40 Page 12 presented were thus an integral component of the coordinated approach taken by the Secretariat. The WTO Secretariat distinction between technical cooperation and training could appear artificial, especially as the TA activities would be further enriched by training components. However, the current Secretariat structure contained two different Divisions: one Technical Cooperation Division charged with the activities outside Geneva and a Training Institute mainly carrying out the Geneva-based activities. However, there had to be close and constant coordination between the two and the two were under his responsibility.","WTCOMTDM40.pdf","Members, Committee, Training, Institute, Secretariat, Training, Institute, WT/COMTD/M, Secretariat, WTO, Secretariat, Secretariat, Geneva, Training, Institute"
"4165",4165,"45","45.      Deputy Director General Mr. Ravier said that Members would recall that in 2001 the Training Division had been reconstituted as the Training Institute and that its mandate had been considerably extended. That had led to a complex transition period for the Training Institute. In fact, that transition period had continued into the year 2002 to enable the Institute not only to come to terms with the new functions it had been assigned, but also to adapt to the doubling, under the 2002 budget, of the three-month trade policy courses held in Geneva which were its main activity until December 2001. The report before Members covered the year 2001. He said that in his view that report provided a clear presentation of the Training Institute's activities. Nevertheless, he wished to make two further comments with respect to the document which he hoped would assist Members' discussions. First, the Institute had used the second part of 2001 to lay the necessary foundations for the introduction of a number of new activities. That largely unseen groundwork consisted, in particular, of coordinating and harmonizing not only the selection procedures for participants and the arrangements for their stay, but also the training materials and programmes of the various courses. Most of those changes would only become visible in the course of the year 2002. To bring up to date the information contained in the report (document WT/COMTD/W/96), he provided the following details for the current year:                                                                                   WT/COMTD/M/40                                                                                          Page 11    •   4 three-month trade policy courses would be organized in 2002:                 −       the 19th trade policy course (in English) had been completed almost three                         weeks earlier ;                 −       the 20th trade policy course (in Spanish) would begin the following week;                 −       the 21st and 22nd trade policy courses (in English) would take place for the                         first time in parallel in the coming autumn in the new training rooms, which                         would have been fitted out by the end of August.    •   2 three-week WTO induction courses for LDCs would be organized in 2002:                 −       the first course (in English) had been completed over three weeks earlier;                 −       the second course (in French) was scheduled to take place, in November.    •   3 one-week specialized courses on Dispute Settlement (in English with interpretation in French        and Spanish) would be organized in 2002:                 −       the first course had taken place two weeks ago;                 −       the second course would take place at the end of July; and                 −       the third would take place in December.    •   3 WTO induction days would be organized in 2002:                 −       the first induction day had been held in February;                 −       the second would be held in May; and                 −       the third was scheduled for the autumn.    •   A first series of internet-based training courses was due to begin in the coming autumn on the        basis of the results of a pilot scheme.    •   The first phase of a Training-of-trainers project had been launched in the spring, for WTO        officials engaged in technical cooperation or training activities.

As a personal final comment he said that the contributions had fallen short of what the Membership collectively had agreed in December 2001 to pay into the account of the Trust Fund. It was understandable that delays occurred in turning pledges into actual payments. However, he recalled that all had agreed when adopting the decision in the General Council to an ambitious set of benchmarks, with the aim of all funds being remitted to the Secretariat by end of June 2002. The reason was that there was a link drawn in the Doha Ministerial Declaration between the availability of TA and the agreement of delegations to deal with the issues set out there. It was therefore important to provide the funds pledged as quickly as possible, to allow the Secretariat to deliver on an ambitious Plan in a short time. Delegations owed it to themselves to provide the means for capacity building so that capacity building could play the positive role in the Doha Development Agenda which was foreseen in the Doha Ministerial Declaration.","WTCOMTDM40.pdf","Trust, Fund, General, Council, Secretariat, Secretariat, Doha, Development, Agenda"
"4160",4160,"40","40.      The pledging conference held on 11 March had produced an unprecedented level of pledges from Members2. At that conference, donors had announced pledges totalling CHF 21.2 million to the Trust Fund for 2002 and a further CHF 3.7 million of earmarked contributions. Those figures included transfers of existing funds to the Trust Fund, but not those funds for which the Secretariat had no instructions from Donors to date in terms of a transfer into the Trust Fund. As the decision taken in December 2001 made clear, where such funds can be used to support the new Trust Funds' activities, they would so be used. Thus, there was scope for the use of funds which were heavily earmarked still to support the objectives of the Trust Fund overall. The downside of the otherwise rosy situation was that funds had been slow in reaching the WTO bank account. In March 2002, the Secretariat had to use up to 80 per cent of the buffer account to cover expenses and commitments which it had already been undertaking according to the Plan. The balance of the Trust Fund was back in the black and the buffer account replenished. The 75 per cent target for receipt at the end of March had been missed. The Trust Fund had by the end of March only received CHF 5.3 million of contributions instead of the target level of CHF 11.25 million as mandated in the General Council’s decision. That was against a level of pledges which was almost 50 per cent higher than the target of         2             Document WT/BFA/SPEC/73. WT/COMTD/M/40 Page 10 CHF 15 million initially agreed by Members. According to the General Council Decision, it was for the CTD and the CBFA to closely supervise whether those benchmarks had been met. Furthermore, when contribution receipt targets were manifestly not met, it was for those to bodies to report to the General Council and for them to meet on an urgent basis to discuss the matter. He would therefore convey the same message to the meeting of the General Council on 14 and 15 May 2002. By 17 April 2002, the total new funds had risen to 7.9 billion and further contributions had been received from Ireland and Estonia, which brought the total receipts of the Trust Fund up to CHF 8.4 million. Document WT/BFA/SPEC/73 would be reissued with any further updates for the meeting of the General Council. If there were imminent payments which Members wished to bring to the attention of the Secretariat, not reflected in the document, he encouraged Members to inform the Secretariat.","WTCOMTDM40.pdf","Secretariat, Trust, Fund, Trust, Fund, WTO, Secretariat, General, Council, Members, General, Council, Decision, CTD, CBFA, General, Council, General, Council, Ireland, Estonia, General, Council, Members, Secretariat, Members, Secretariat"

In addition, a buffer account of CHF 1 million was created out of the 2000 WTO budget surplus to cover temporary shortfalls in the Trust Fund in case contributions did not keep pace with activities’ expenses. The monitoring of the achievements of those mile-stones were jointly entrusted to the CTD and the Budget Committee. Since then, the CTD had approved the Co-ordinated WTO Secretariat Annual Technical Assistance Plan for 2002 (WT/COMTD/W/95/Rev.3) and the Secretariat had estimated the total cost of that Plan at CHF 17.3 million, after deduction of an ambitious amount of cost sharing (CHF 5 million) with other institutions, including UNCTAD and a number of regional development banks.","WTCOMTDM40.pdf","WTO, Trust, Fund, CTD, Budget, Committee, CTD, WTO, Secretariat, Secretariat, UNCTAD"

Mr.Neil McMillan, Chairman of the CBFA, said that it was worth recalling that at its meeting held on 19-20 December 2001, the General Council had approved the terms of reference of the Doha Development Agenda Global Trust Fund (DDAGTF) contained in the report of the CBFA (WT/BFA/56). In particular, the General Council had approved a target of CHF 15 million for the Doha Development Agenda Global Trust Fund for 2002. Three miles-stones were attached to that amount in terms of the payment of the funds into the WTO Secretariat Bank Account. An amount equivalent to:         -        25 per cent of that target (i.e. CHF 3.75 million) should have been deposited into                  WTO bank account by the end of 2001;         -        75 per cent (i.e. CHF 11.25 million) should have been deposited by the end of March                  2002; and the aim was for         -        100 per cent (i.e. CHF 15 million) to be deposited at the end of June 2002.","WTCOMTDM40.pdf","McMillan, Chairman, CBFA, General, Council, Doha, Development, Agenda, Global, Trust, Fund, General, Council, WTO, Secretariat, Bank, Account, WTO"

The representative of Canada recalled the comment made earlier with respect to sustainability both in terms of funding, and more so in terms of the capacity of the WTO Secretariat.

"4151",4151,"32","32.      The Chairman said that the Committee had received good information on the technical cooperation and training programmes undertaken by the WTO Secretariat. It was important that the WTO Secretariat responded to the Members-driven agenda in terms of technical cooperation and capacity building. There were a number of observations from the floor pointing to the need to look at the issue of capacity building beyond TA per se. The medium and long term perspectives of capacity building had to be considered in addition to the seminars and workshops which were valuable in the short run.","WTCOMTDM40.pdf","Chairman, Committee, WTO, Secretariat, WTO, Secretariat"
"4150",4150,"31","31.      He went on to say that he shared the view that there had to be some flexibility in the delivery of WTO TA, and there would be a certain degree of flexibility. However, flexibility was not another name for ad-hocism. That there would be flexibility did not mean that ad-hoc requests would be accommodated. The CARICOM had approached the Secretariat to readjust by replacing some of the activities earlier suggested by new projects. There was a flood of requests from different organizations to the WTO Secretariat. The WTO Secretariat therefore needed to be rigorous and disciplined in its responses in order to be able to deliver on the commitments made in a manner that would be qualitatively satisfactory. With respect to cooperation with other agencies, he said that the WTO had a good working relationship with several agencies such as UNCTAD, UNEP, ITC, WCO and had an active dialogue with UNIDO, OECD and some others. The challenge was to find appropriate co-financing arrangements. He did not believe that there was any expectation that the WTO would be funding the totality of the costs out of the Doha Development Agenda Trust Fund for activities with other agencies. Discussions with other agencies were ongoing. The issue of the length of seminars had to be looked at in its totality in response to the requests. With respect to the type of activities delivered so far in 2002 he said that they covered all themes in the Plan.","WTCOMTDM40.pdf","WTO, CARICOM, Secretariat, WTO, Secretariat, WTO, Secretariat, WTO, UNCTAD, UNEP, ITC, WCO, UNIDO, OECD, WTO, Doha, Development, Agenda, Trust, Fund"

That position had been taken by the heads of agencies in paragraph 7 of their Communiqué of 26 February 2002.1 However, there were several non-LDCs which had asked for the model of the IF to be applied to the assistance they received. Those Governments considered that the totality of their trade development needs would be better met by the agencies working jointly on the basis of the IF concept. The agencies were considering applying the concept to other countries. As they had received specific requests in that regard, there was a favourable disposition in the agencies to do so. The reason was also that the Members had asked the agencies to coordinate better, to seek coherence and to be complementary in the way they responded to the priority needs of non LDCs as well as LDCs. It was no question of a simple extension of the IF, nor would the resources of the Trust Fund be applied to non LDCs. What was considered was an extension of the application of the concept.","WTCOMTDM40.pdf","Chiedu, Osakwe, Director, Technical, Cooperation, Division, Members"

With respect to internal Secretariat coordination he said that a Technical Cooperation Management Committee (TAMC) had existed for almost a year. The TAMC met once a month and comprised the relevant directors and one representative of each substantive Division as WTO TA activities increasingly were carried out by the substantive divisions and not by the Technical Cooperation Division. Those meetings were productive. As information was WT/COMTD/M/40 Page 8 exchanged, it was a learning process for all involved.

She wished to hear more about the proposal for a two-faced training of trade negotiators programme. In light of the dynamism of the negotiations, an intensive first phase of the programme, before the Mexico Ministerial Conference, could provide benefits as the skills acquired could be utilized during the remaining part of the negotiations, in particular after the Mexico Ministerial Conference.","WTCOMTDM40.pdf","Malaysia, WTO, Secretariat, Mexico"

He asked whether the Secretariat could consider prolonging the seminars which lasted for less than one week as it was impossible to understand the WTO system in just three days. So short seminars used donor money which could be better spent, and implied lost time for Secretariat staff. The participants would not get a result out of it which corresponded to their needs either. The last seminar in Djibouti had lasted three days with about forty participants. He asked whether these participants really had obtained a knowledge which corresponded to their needs. On the contrary, the three week courses for LDC officials gave satisfactory results as did the three months courses.","WTCOMTDM40.pdf","Djibouti, WTO, TA, LDCs, Secretariat, WTO, Secretariat, Djibouti, LDC"

It was not the least important for beneficiaries to articulate their requirements at an early stage and her Government would attempt to meet the deadlines set. However, she urged that it not be forgotten that situations constantly evolved and that a certain level of flexibility therefore had to be included in all programmes and plans designed. She did not urge for ad-hocism but for some flexibility. There should be a preparedness to respond to the needs of developing countries as those needs became apparent.

"4141",4141,"23","23.      The representative of Uganda said that his delegation was pleased with the direction WTO TA activities were taking. He agreed that the short time-frame for planning had made it difficult for the Secretariat to include elements of the Doha Development Agenda into the 2002 TA Plan. Advance preparations for the 2003 Plan were welcome and he urged other Members to take advantage of that. Although there were problems with the Integrated Framework (IF), there was the idea to extend it to other countries. He said that his delegation saw a problem with such an extension as the IF still was a pilot scheme. Before a pilot scheme could be extended it had to be ensured that it was effective and working. He therefore asked the Secretariat to explain the future plans in that regard as                                                                                      WT/COMTD/M/40                                                                                              Page 7 the LDCs were getting worried that in an attempt to widen the scope of the IF, its effectiveness might be lost even before it had been perfected.","WTCOMTDM40.pdf","Uganda, WTO, Secretariat, Doha, Development, Agenda, Members, Secretariat, LDCs"

At the end of small roman (i) of paragraph 2 there was a commitment to inform the Membership of partnerships under negotiation in the many areas where the WTO was not the best placed to deliver TA. Although there seemed to be progress with regional banks, he asked how contacts with other agencies had evolved as there were many other international organizations or agencies with which the WTO should cooperate. He also requested additional information on the in-house coordination, and especially with respect to how the TAMC had functioned.

Deputy Director General Mr. Ravier said that he wished to say a few words on the recent initiative of the Director-General, as set out in his communication of 4 April 2002 to all Geneva-based ambassadors. That initiative proposed the holding of parallel three-month trade policy courses in English in Nairobi and in French in Rabat. The programme of those courses would be substantially the same as that of the residential courses run by the WTO Training Institute in Geneva. The first series of courses was intended for officials from African countries. Should the experience prove positive, it could be extended to other parts of the world. The project was a joint undertaking with the respective universities of those two cities. The courses would, insofar as it was possible, not be given by WTO officials, but by various experts selected from amongst retired GATT and WTO officials, and among experts proposed by Members in response to an invitation from the Director-General, or from experts put forward by the host institutions or donors within the framework of project financing. He pointed out that the project was an addition to and fell outside both the ""normal"" activities of WTO Training Institute, of which the Committee had already been informed at a previous meeting, and the consolidated technical assistance programme under the Doha Trust Fund. It was an additional, and as yet unfunded, activity. Neither did it replace any other scheduled activities of which Members had been informed.","WTCOMTDM40.pdf","Director, Ravier, Director-General, Nairobi, Rabat, WTO, Training, Institute, Geneva, WTO, GATT, WTO, Members, Director-General, WTO, Training, Institute, Committee, Doha, Trust, Fund, Members"

The Secretariat would be asking them to inform the Secretariat of any invitations they intended to extend to the WTO Secretariat, asking for resource persons, for their programmes and activities in 2003. The WTO Secretariat needed to immediately plan for them. In the past few years, the Secretariat had received many invitations from other international agencies, both at the multilateral and regional level, inviting the WTO Secretariat to participate by providing resource persons. Most of the programmes and activities of many international organizations were essentially focussed on the work of the WTO. However, many of the invitations were received at the last minute and classified as urgent. The WTO Secretariat treated those invitations as TA as they could not be classified as anything else in the WTO budget. To be able to respond to them, the Secretariat had to plan ahead. Unlike previous years, the Secretariat would not be able to respond positively if it did not plan well in WT/COMTD/M/40 Page 6 advance. Members were invited to provide the Secretariat with any ideas they might have, for improving on the design and the architecture of the WTO TA Plan.

"4135",4135,"18","18.      Mr. Chiedu Osakwe, Director, Technical Cooperation Division said that the Secretariat had initiated the process for designing the WTO TA Plan for 2003. 2001 and 2002 were transitional years in WTO technical cooperation. A far-reaching re-organization had been undertaken in 2001 of both the structure of the Technical Cooperation Division and the elaboration of the New Strategy. Post-Doha, in interaction with Members in the CTD, the architecture of the WTO TA Plan had been significantly changed and Members had assisted the Secretariat in designing the 7 pillars of the Secretariat response to the TC mandates in the Doha Ministerial Declaration. However, there had been a considerable rush and the work had been done under pressure. It was the intention of the Secretariat to present a draft TA Plan for 2003 to the CTD after the summer break. To that end, the Secretariat wished to invite Members and Observers to submit their requests for TA for 2003 to the Technical Cooperation Division before the end of July 2002. The requests received would be processed on the basis of consultations with the requesting countries. Requests should include clear indications of venue, for both regional and national activities, and dates. The Secretariat had began early as one of the difficult challenges that the Secretariat had faced in the implementation of earlier TA Plans was inability to plan ahead because of the late receipt of requests. Forward planning would assist the Secretariat, Members and Observers to limit ad hoc requests. While the Secretariat had kept ad hoc requests in the 2002 Plan to a minimum, the intention was to hold it to zero in the 2003 Plan, except in the most exceptional of circumstances. Ad hoc requests had had a damaging effect on WTO TA Plans and had affected implementation and delivery of agreed activities.","WTCOMTDM40.pdf","Chiedu, Osakwe, Director, Technical, Cooperation, Division, Secretariat, WTO, WTO, Technical, Cooperation, Division, Members, CTD, WTO, Members, Secretariat, Secretariat, Secretariat, CTD, Secretariat, Members, Technical, Cooperation, Division, Secretariat, Secretariat, Secretariat, Members, Secretariat, WTO"

Delegations felt, in conclusion, that there is need to continue the debate and further analytical work including impact studies to get a clearer picture of the implications of e-commerce for the development of developing countries in fulfilment of the Doha Development Agenda. It seems that e- commerce poses both challenges and opportunities to developed and developing country governments and companies alike. The direct effects on government revenue through tariff losses seem to be very small whereas the effects on the efficiency of an economy can be large.

The Government of Kenya recognises the important role that e-commerce can play in trade development and particularly in poverty alleviation and that the country needs to catch up with e- commerce. A national Task Force on e-commerce was therefore established in 1999 with the mandate of enhancing the use of e-commerce. The task force has now been re-constituted and registered as an independent organization: the Nationwide Task Force on E-Commerce (NTFECOM). The initiatives have been strengthened further through the International Trade Centre's (ITC) ""E-Trade Bridge""-Programme for Kenya which is spearheaded by NTFECOM. Through this programme the NTFECOM has been able to identify Kenya's e-commerce strengths and weaknesses and is currently in the process of translating the E-Trade Programme into a policy document for submission to the Government. The Government should then prioritize:     -        policies for facilitating e-trade;     -        telecommunications infrastructure;     -        the legal and regulatory framework;     -        the financial environment;     -        human and institutional capacity building; and     -        the e-commerce support network.

Although intellectual property rights in Kenya are governed by the Industrial Property Act, the onus of monitoring infringement of intellectual property rights rests with the owners. The Government will only act on enforcement. One private sector organization, the Music Copyright Society Kenya (MCSK), has been active in monitoring the infringement of copyrights and they have in certain cases been successful. Other rights holders do not have associations.","WTCOMTDM40.pdf","Kenya, Kenya"
"4131",4131,"175","175.     The growth of e-commerce has great potential to expand markets, productivity and competitiveness. The challenge and dilemma for the Government is how to tax the increased revenue arising from e-transactions. On the other hand Kenya's competitive edge is in the agriculture and manufacturing sectors and the priority concern for the Government is rather how to enhance access to the Internet to improve productivity in those sectors rather than how to tax Internet transactions. The major challenges therefore include:         -       enhanced technical and institutional capacity to monitor e-transactions;         -       human resource development;         -       compliance and enforcement, especially in the large informal sector; and         -       improved communications infrastructure.","WTCOMTDM40.pdf","Kenya"

Out of KShs. 200 000 million collected every year, direct taxes contribute about a quarter while indirect taxes contributes slightly over half of the total revenue. Only import duties and VAT on imports together accounts for a quarter of total government revenue. Since 1997 import duties collected have shown an upward trend, although as from the year 2000 the increase has been marginal. This latter can be attributed to the liberalisation measures being undertaken both at regional and international level and particularly within the COMESA as member states adopt the Free Trade Area.","WTCOMTDM40.pdf","Kenya, COMESA"

A common policy spanning many different              ministries and government agencies is necessary but currently lacking.         -    adopt a legal framework, possibly based on the UNCITRAL model law. There is as yet              no legal framework covering electronic transactions.         -    develop the telecommunications infrastructure, especially in rural areas where              70 per cent of the population live, but where access to electricity, telephone and financial              services is limited and costs high.","WTCOMTDM40.pdf","Kenya, Kenya, UNCITRAL"
"4128",4128,"172","172.    The state of the information technology infrastructure in Kenya gives a picture of the development of its e-commerce. Access to the Intenet is exclusively controlled by ""Jambo Net"", which is a subsidiary of the state-controlled Telkom Kenya. ""Jambo Net"" sells bandwidth to various Internet Services Providers (ISPs). Although more than a hundred ISPs have been licenced by the Communications Commission of Kenya (CCK.) as required, only about 30 are operational. Similarly Telkom Kenya has the exclusive rights for the provision of international Very Small Aperture Terminal (VSAT) facilities. The following statistics gives an indication of the use of e-commerce in Kenya:         -    Teledensity is pegged at 4 lines per 100 people in urban areas and 0.16 rural in areas;         -    Internet access is limited to about 200,000 people out of a population of 30 million;         -    50 per cent of the users are multi-national corporations, international corporations and              NGO'S;         -    Less than 5 per cent of the users are government and educational institutions;         -    There are only about 50,000 e-mail accounts;         -    The number of "".ke""-domains was about 1,700 in 2001;         -    Most websites are run by exporters of products or services, i.e.                         (i)      Tours and Travel         50%                         (ii)     Hotels and Restaurants 20%                         (iii)    Arts and Handicrafts     16%                         (iv)     Agriculture              4%                         (v)      Manufacturing            1%                         (vi)     Shipping                 1%","WTCOMTDM40.pdf","Kenya, Kenya, Communications, Commission, of, Kenya, Kenya, Kenya"

The Government of Kenya recognises the important role that e-commerce can play for trade and development and in particular for poverty alleviation. However, the current focus is on developing policies which recognize the electronic aspects of trade in transforming the economy into a modern market economy. This is done through various initiatives. First, the Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP) recognizes that ICTs have an important role to play in poverty alleviation. Trade and e- commerce are also important in that respect. The telecommunication and postal sector policy statement of 1999 is another initiative. Third, Kenya is a participant in the New Partnership for African Development (NEPAD). Finally, the Government had set up a sector Working Group on Information Technology under the Ministry of Finance and Planning.","WTCOMTDM40.pdf","Kenya, Malaysia, Barbados, Kenya, Kenya, Working, Group, on, Information, Technology, Ministry, of, Finance"
"4126",4126,"170","170.     The Government of Barbados will continue to develop systems that integrate with e- commerce and facilitate the clearance of physical goods through the port. In this regard there is an existing system of integration of express delivery carrier operations with the customs department which facilitates the automatic download of an aircraft's manifest upon take off which allows for the automatic generation of tax computation for the entire manifest and the payment of all import duties and VAT for all cargo upon landing. This system can be expanded to all air and sea freight carriers. The technology can thus be used to enhance the discipline and the accuracy of the current system of tax collection. As e-commerce is a dynamic activity, it would be imprudent to burden the private sector with cumbersome regulations and tax systems which would inhibit experimentation in the current period of developing new products, services and delivery systems. A vision could be the steam engine developed in Europe with a man carrying a red flag walking in front of it to ensure that it did not go too fast. The Government of Barbados does not intend to put any red flags in front of the Internet. Barbados stands to gain much more by maintaining an environment conducive to the growth and development of e-commerce than by introducing new and restrictive measures to tax digital WT/COMTD/M/40 Page 38 products and services at this point in time. Barbados's experience to date does not indicate a significant loss in revenue while there has been a positive contribution in several areas. This includes the expansion of the hospitality industry and the development of repeat customers, direct marketing of local products, and the development of new business opportunities that expand economic activity beyond the island shores into the region, the Western Hemisphere and the global marketplace.

"4124",4124,"169","169.    In light of the potential for the expansion of the economy by utilizing e-commerce to reach a wider market and to focus on specific high yield customers, the Government of Barbados believes that it would not be prudent to implement direct taxation on trade in digital products and services delivered through electronic means at this time. Thus the Government of Barbados supports the provisional agreement not to introduce any new tax on electronic transmissions through which digital products and services are delivered. Governments must also be mindful of the rapidly changing technological environment and the introduction of second Internet (II) that will expand the range and complexity of e-commerce through the introduction of high speed transmissions coupled with enhanced security systems. This will introduce new products and new ways of conducting business which are unpredictable at this time.","WTCOMTDM40.pdf","Government, of, Barbados, Government, of, Barbados"

However, electronically transmitted products such as software, music and video, and other services escape both import duties and VAT. This loss in revenue for the Government of Barbados must be balanced with the need to encourage the growth of e-commerce to maximize the sale of goods and services from Barbados to the rapidly expanding global electronic market place.","WTCOMTDM40.pdf","Barbados, Barbados"
"4122",4122,"167","167.     New challenges have arisen and will continue to arise in areas such as taxation, where governments will continue to seek to protect revenue streams. The Government of Barbados believes that this should be done without distorting economic and technological choices. Any changes require a reassessment of the effectiveness of government policies towards commerce and of traditional commercial practices and procedures, most of which were formed in an analogue world with a different image of commerce in mind. Present experiences with e-commerce fall into two broad categories: trade in physical and digital products and trade in a growing number of services. Because of the nascent stage of development of e-commerce there is much uncertainty about the nature of the trade that will take place in intangible or digital products and a difficulty in determining the classification of such products as goods or services.","WTCOMTDM40.pdf","Barbados"
"4121",4121,"166","166.    E-commerce provides an opportunity to the developing world for a significant period of economic expansion in an increasingly interconnected world. It provides the potential for more sustainable development, the creation of better jobs, expanded world trade and improved social conditions. It offers the possibility of breaking the cycle of incremental change with marginal improvements or stagnation by vastly improving efficiency, reducing transactions costs and expanding both markets and products at an unprecedented rate. E-commerce involves much more than transactional activity. It involves marketing, customer service, problem solving and research. Research is vital for many businesses who need to track things such as commodity prices to keep the local suppliers honest.","WTCOMTDM40.pdf",""
"4120",4120,"165","165.    The experience of Barbados shows that it is possible for small countries and small suppliers to take advantage of e-commerce opportunities. One example is a St. Lucian entrepreneur who attempted to sell a ""cocoa-stick"" out of which one could make hot cocoa, on the Internet. He targeted the St. Lucian diaspora in North America and Europe. After two days he had to shut the Website down. The problem was that he had sold three years of supply. This story shows that the opportunities are there, but they need to be backed by business plans to take account of unforeseen circumstances. Flexibility to involve other people and build alliances is also necessary to meet market demand.

It has to be recognized that E-commerce will transform the national and global economic landscape and the emergence of a new breed of companies providing services in cyber-space. The borderless nature of e-commerce will expose countries to the effects of liberalization and globalization and it is imperative for nations to be ""e-ready."" They need to focus and develop skills in the knowledge-intensive areas required by global markets such as e-commerce tax advisors and e- commerce lawyers.

"4118",4118,"163","163.      The Malaysian Government has come across several difficulties in taxing e-commerce. For income taxes it has experienced the difficulty of applying ""source-based"" taxation and the question of whether a server is considered a ""physical presence"" for tax purposes. Another difficulty experienced is that the tax provisions do not cover multi-jurisdictional transactions and that there are enforcement problems as information can be encrypted and lack audit trails. The Government might consider the introduction of stringent regulations as to identity, legislation that would impose a duty on the Internet Service Provider (ISP) to obtain information from businesses registering with them, and powers to decode encrypted private data. It might also attempt to renegotiate double tax agreements as in current agreements it is not clear whether websites or host servers are permanent establishments subject to tax. The Malaysian Stamp Duty Act of 1949 based on paper instruments is difficult to enforce on electronic documents. The Government might try to extend the stamp duty to electronic documents. For other types of taxes the difficulties include the fact that record keeping requirements are based on paper documents. Enforcement provisions should provide for electronic records. The delivery of intangible goods increases the ease of avoiding the payment of duties and current provisions for enforcement are insufficient to capture e-commerce transactions. The monitoring, audit and investigative powers of the Government therefore need to be enhanced to take modern information technologies into account.","WTCOMTDM40.pdf",""
"4117",4117,"162","162.     Other pressing issues for the Government, demanded by vendors, include requests for standard guidelines (regulations) for e-commerce, the endorsement of credible merchants, the promotion of local e-commerce products and services, consumer protection, IP protection and enforcement, and grants and subsidies. The existing legal framework in Malaysia is insufficient. The role of existing regulators has to be reviewed. Changes to the regulatory framework is necessary to boost consumer confidence. The aim is to expand existing laws to apply equally to online and offline transactions with minimal and light-handed interventions. Self regulation is promoted and consumer guidelines should be drawn up. There have been conflicts between trademark rights and registration of domain names and there has been inequality in bargaining power in registration of domain names. Much work is needed to develop an intellectual property management system. Another challenge for the Malaysian Government is to enact new laws based on the UNCTIRAL Model Law to apply contractual principles to e-commerce. The domestic laws for settling disputes also need to be revised to take the electronic business environment into account.","WTCOMTDM40.pdf","Malaysia"
"4116",4116,"161","161.    E-business may be used to circumvent non-tariff barriers and gain access to the protected service sectors of emerging economies. The Government of Malaysia is concerned with the impact of e-commerce on taxation. The concerns are based on the growth of virtual organizations which cannot be tracked as electronic trade does not require the physical presence of the people or agencies WT/COMTD/M/40 Page 36 involved, the absence of a clear definition of ""transaction"" for tax collection purposes, and the potential loss of revenue due to increased tax evasion and the ""black economy"".","WTCOMTDM40.pdf","Malaysia"
"4115",4115,"160","160.     Some lessons have been learned. Nations need to identify clusters for industrial development and reposition themselves to be at the centre of the virtual marketplace. E-commerce reduces the transaction costs which represent a large portion of the activities within an economy, thus leading to efficiency gains. E-commerce has also led to the destruction of the vertically integrated value chain. Consumers have the choice of new intermediaries or no intermediaries at all. Enhanced information and new channels make it easier for companies to buy at lowest cost and sell at highest price. The global implications are that first movers enjoy entrenched positions. Companies will move location if the policies are more favourable elsewhere. There will be winners and losers in the knowledge age and companies and governments need to be ready. Government interventionist policies are needed to correct for market imperfections. Capital will gravitate towards a few ""hubs"" which have developed a critical mass of users and producers. Developing countries might soon become attractive.","WTCOMTDM40.pdf",""

The idea is to go from an information society through a knowledge society to a value-based knowledge society considering both social and economic aspects. The tool is the Multimedia Super Corridor (MSC) which will enhance Malaysia's competitiveness. The strategy is first to offer an ideal multi-media environment to attract world-class companies which in turn can catalyze Malaysian companies to become world class over time. The Malaysian MSC is more than just a technology park. It has special cyberlaws, policies and practices and modern infrastructure. The seven flagship applications are smart schools, multi-purpose cards, electronic government, telehealth, R&D clusters, borderless marketing centers and a Worldwide Manufacturing Web. Progress to date (i.e. during the seven years the project has existed) include almost 700 companies with MSC status out of which 50 are world-class, the initiation of the Government multi-purpose card, growing investments in technology and high value-added economic activities, rapid growth in sales and exports, creation of new knowledge-based employment opportunities, growth in higher learning institutions, increased SME participation, and spin-offs to the rest of the economy including enhanced productivity. The idea is for the MSC to expand to all of Malaysia before 2020 and for Malaysia to leap-frog into leadership in the knowledge economy. It is estimated that when 20 per cent of the Malaysian population has access to the Internet, e-commerce growth will really take off.","WTCOMTDM40.pdf","Malaysia, Malaysia, MSC, MSC, MSC, Malaysia, Malaysia"

Most tax systems deal with business-to-business taxation on a self-assessment basis in the jurisdiction where consumption is deemed to take place. The place of taxation for consumption is not always easy to determine for intangibles, especially where intangibles are linked to physical goods. Such cases create opportunities for businesses to split the transactions among different companies. For internal business-to-business transactions the EC has a system with tax collection taking place in one of the 15 EC Member states. The new tax laws will be put in place for an initial three-year period after which the evolution of e-commerce will be evaluated. It can be asked why, for a relatively small area of activity, has EC gone the trouble to make a significant change in a tax system to attempt to collect taxes from companies which do not have a physical presence in the jurisdiction. The reason is the potential importance of e-commerce for the tax-base for the European VAT system. Malaysia","WTCOMTDM40.pdf","EC, EC, EC, Member, EC, Malaysia"
"4110",4110,"156","156.     The Council of the European Community is currently in the process of changing the VAT legislation to take into account specific problems raised by e-commerce. The new laws will take effect on 1 July 2003.9 The EC is the first large jurisdiction to attempt to implement the OECD principles. The reasons include that the EC has a VAT system with a general tax on consumption (whether a good or a service). For businesses there is a provision for credit for input tax. These changes are not revenue driven. The intention is rather to rectify a competitive imbalance. What had happened was that the EC effectively taxed exported services while imported services became tax exempted. The potential for competitive imbalance was found in the areas of software, Web-hosting, programme maintenance, data processing, entertainment, music, sports events, distance teaching and gambling. The tax rules with respect to broadcasting were changed at the same time, as the tax problems were similar and as convergence in technology will bring them together. The competitive imbalances occur where EU-based companies are required to pay VAT whereas companies supplying EC consumers from a base abroad are tax exempted. What the EC will do is to change the place of supply (taxation) in order for all companies supplying EC consumers with digitally delivered services to be taxed equally. The EC attempts to introduce the changes to create a level playing field without disrupting legitimate business activities.","WTCOMTDM40.pdf","European, Community, EC, OECD, EC, EC, EC, EC, EC, EC"
"4109",4109,"155","155.    The European Communities (EC) has experience of the implications for consumption taxes of e-commerce, specifically in relation to the European Union Value Added Tax (VAT) system. The current urgency is the potential competitive imbalances that could be created. The EC is not of the view that there is a need for an international moratorium on domestic taxes on e-commerce. However, there is a need for an international agreement on fundamental principles. One of the building blocks was laid at the OECD's Ottawa Conference in 1998 where, as far as consumption taxes are concerned, there was a measure of agreement on two general principles. One was that if e- commerce transactions are to be taxed, then taxation should accrue to the jurisdiction in which consumption takes place. The second was that for consumption tax purposes, these transactions should not be treated as goods. When the European Union considered applying these principles to its own tax systems there were some potential points of tension. Three possible paths could be taken. One was to wait for e-business to mature before taking any action. The second was to adopt a moratorium on e-commerce taxes and remove them where they had already been applied. Thirdly, there was the path the EC opted for, which was to change the tax system to take account of cross- border transactions in e-commerce where they cause tension within the domestic regime.","WTCOMTDM40.pdf","EC, EC, OECD, Ottawa, Conference, European, Union, EC"

However, it was also said that the understanding of some delegations is that the existing rules already apply to e-commerce.

What needs to be considered with respect to tariff revenue is how significant the value of GATT tariffs are on these products and what the status of tariffs is under GATS. As concerns tax revenue, Members are entitled to non-discriminatory internal taxes under both GATT and GATS and need to consider the feasibility and desirability of taxing on-line products. With respect to the levels of benefits, the implications of classification concerns for products traditionally subject to sensitivities and trade restrictions are different from the implications for products for which freer trade has been the norm. Delegations will have to consider if it is reasonable that a determination on classification, in itself, might result in the removal of barriers on certain products or in the evaporation of benefits heretofore available for others, and if there is a case for possible consideration of sector-specific solutions for certain products.","WTCOMTDM40.pdf","GATT, GATS, Members, GATT, GATS"
"4105",4105,"151","151.     Some of the products concerned can and do enter markets under both GATT and GATS at the same time depending on the ""carriage"" or delivery vehicle used. This may continue to be the case for some time to come. In some cases, the content is similar or even identical but receives different treatment depending on whether GATT or GATS applies. Even if the status quo was accepted as an option some classification work might still be needed as neither GATT nor GATS classification schemes may fully or unambiguously cover some of the products or content concerned. If the products concerned were classified as goods it may clarify the situation with respect to tariffs and national treatment for these products. However, it could have unintended consequences for the scope of the GATS as it might affect the status of other on-line services beyond those actually at issue. On the other hand, if the products concerned were to be classified as services, it may clarify the status of most forms of e-commerce. It would nevertheless leave open the issue of differing treatment of similar products delivered by physical and electronic means and it could raise questions on the GATT status of the content of digital products that remain traded in physical formats.","WTCOMTDM40.pdf","GATT, GATS, GATT, GATT, GATS, GATT"
"4104",4104,"150","150.     As already noted, classification has become a pivotal issue because of the structural differences between the GATT and the GATS. The essence of GATT is to reduce or eliminate tariffs over time through the binding of tariff concessions, but tariffs are permitted under those rules. National treatment of internal taxes is obligatory under GATT. On the other hand, tariffs are so uncommon in services trade that the GATS does not even mention them. National treatment for internal taxes is negotiated service by service under GATS. Levels of benefits extended by GATT can thus differ significantly from those available under GATS in the short term. While quantitative restrictions are prohibited under the GATT and national treatment is obligatory, under GATS the progressive elimination of barriers to trade is negotiated and national treatment progressively implemented. The differences between the agreements are largely eliminated if the full implementation of each is considered. In addition, the scope of the GATS is wider. The main difference between the two agreements remaining with full liberalization would be the scope. The GATS covers not only the imports of a product but four different modes of supply and there are benefits accruing to the suppliers of the products, in particular through ""commercial presence"" mode. Generalizing, it can be said that the GATT corresponds to the GATS mode 1 which is ""cross-border supply"". The classification issue is thus both limited to a small group of products which can be traded on-line and/or physically, and to only one of the four modes of supply under the GATS.","WTCOMTDM40.pdf","GATT, GATS, GATT, GATT, GATS, GATS, GATT, GATS, GATT, GATS, GATS, GATT, GATS"

It can also be questioned whether new forms of ""carriage"" without a physical medium is part of the GATT and what that content is. The question goes to the heart of the definition of information. The GATS appears to cover the development, production, and distribution of information and entertainment, as well as the live performance and adaptation of radio and TV broadcasts.         8            The views expressed with respect to the WTO specific considerations were those of an individual Secretariat staff member, speaking in her personal capacity, and do not reflect any views on the part of the WTO Secretariat.

Trade in these products amounts to approximately 1 per cent of total merchandize trade and less than 1 per cent of total duties collected world wide. Moreover, only some on-line products are concerned as much of what can be delivered electronically is regarded as services. The vast majority of services are therefore not at stake. Most media and entertainment products never did cross borders in physical formats and are clearly regarded as services, such as television and radio programming and broadcasting for example. Approximately 99 per cent of merchandise trade and more than 99 per cent of duties collected world wide are not at stake and there has not yet been any dispute with respect to the classification problem.","WTCOMTDM40.pdf",""

It had also been observed, although no final conclusion has been arrived at, that the modes of supply through which services are defined in the Services Agreement (GATS) make no distinctions with regard to the technologies involved in the delivery. There are no references or exclusions of any technology that might be used for electronic supply. If that could be formally agreed, it would mean that existing obligations and commitments of the GATS apply to e-commerce in services. With regard to goods, the Council for Trade in Goods has observed that when a purchase is made on-line but the product delivered physically, the normal GATT rules apply. However, the Council for Trade in Goods has left open the question of how to treat a product that can be traded in either physical or digital form.","WTCOMTDM40.pdf","WTO, Work, Programme, Council, for, Trade, in, Services, GATS, Council, for, Trade, in, Goods, GATT, Council, for, Trade, in, Goods"

The e-commerce classification issue concerns whether digital deliveries of certain types of products fall under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) or the General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS) framework. This issue seems to have become one of the most difficult and sensitive issues of the entire WTO Work Programme on e-commerce. The classification issue relates to other questions such as customs duties and the potential differences in how internal taxes are dealt with. However, the classification issue is not only a revenue consideration, it is also linked to levels of liberalization and benefits across the two agreements. In this connection, it is important to note that the Moratorium on customs duties on electronic transmissions relates only to customs duties and not to other taxes.","WTCOMTDM40.pdf","General, Agreement, on, Tariffs, and, Trade, GATT, General, Agreement, on, Trade, in, Services, WTO, Work, Programme"

Despite that, e-commerce offers several opportunities for developing countries. Duty-free imports of electronic deliverables will provide consumers and the private sector in developing countries with cheaper imports, especially as software is becoming increasingly important for businesses wishing to engage in e-commerce.

"4097",4097,"144","144.    Although developing countries receive the largest share when tariff revenue alone is considered (about US$ 0.6 billion out of the world total of almost one billion US$), developed countries have the lion's share when all import revenue, including consumption taxes are considered. Nevertheless, tariff revenue from digitized products in 1999 was minimal to total government revenue in both developed (0,04 per cent) and developing countries (0,16 per cent). The share of total government revenue stemming from the revenue of imported digitized products is 0.6 per cent in developing countries and 0.4 per cent in developed countries. The potential relative revenue losses are thus relatively higher in developing countries than in developed countries although they are small in terms of overall government revenue. As developing countries generally tend to rely to a greater extent on tariffs for their government revenue, any tariff reduction is costly. This is nothing specific to e-commerce.

Considering the tariffs on products that could be delivered in digitized form over the Internet, developing countries applied an average MFN rate of about 15 per cent whereas in developed countries the figure was under 4 per cent in 1999. However, there are large variations between individual countries in each group and between products. Although developing countries only import about 20 per cent of world digitized imports, the higher import duties they levy means that developing countries receive more than 60 per cent of world tariff revenue from products in this category. Other duties levied on imports of products that could be delivered in digitized form over the Internet include customs surcharges such as fees, uplifts, statistical taxes and port taxes which on an average adds about 7 per cent to the customs tariff, and internal taxes such as VAT, sales taxes and consumption taxes which add an additional 15 per cent to the tariff. World tariff revenue on digitized products amounted to just less than one billion US$ in 1999 whereas the figure is 8 billion US$ when other customs surcharges and internal taxes are included.","WTCOMTDM40.pdf",""

Digitized products can be defined as products that can be identified by HS code, delivered physically (via carrier medium such as cd, tape, diskette, hard copy), and be transformed into digital format and transferred digitally (via networks). Digitized products include items such as books, newspapers and other printed material, software, recorded music, film, video and video games. According to 1999 statistics, developed countries accounted for more than 80 per cent of both imports and exports of these products. However, digitized products accounted for less than one per cent of the value of world imports and exports respectively and less than half a per cent of developing country imports and exports. Nevertheless, the growth of developing country digitized exports has been higher than the corresponding growth rates for developed countries in the last few years. This indicates that developing countries are increasing their share of digitized exports.","WTCOMTDM40.pdf",""

Governments need to agree on how to divide the income tax base among themselves. The challenges posed by e-commerce for tax administration are enormous. However, the implications of modern information technologies for tax administrations are not exclusively negative. New technologies create increased opportunities for streamlining tax administration by replacing paper documentation with electronic data interchange (EDI), by providing for electronic filing of tax returns, and by automating other aspects of tax reporting and compliance. Some countries might almost be able to ""skip the paper generation"".

"4092",4092,"14","14.      Deputy Director General Mr. Ravier continued with his sixth point relating to ownership through self-financing participants. He underscored the necessity for increased beneficiary ownership in WTO TA. Ownership could be expressed in various ways. It had to be recognized that WTO training and TA activities were integral parts of human resources development (HRD), a key component of national economic development. WTO delivery of training and TA could only be a supplement to the necessary national expenditures for HRD. One was not a substitute for the other. In that regard, he was pleased to report that some delegations were considering self-financing the participation of government officials in selected WTO training activities. That was a welcome development since it would give a greater degree of ownership. He recommended it to other delegations who were in a position to do so. He said that he wished to re-emphasise a point mentioned in a previous update; it was necessary for TA beneficiaries to also include their TA priorities and demands either in their Poverty Reduction Strategy Papers (PRSPs) or in their national plans for economic development. PRSPs were the basis for World Bank and International Monetary Fund policy lending and grant support. It was important to know that trade-related TA activities and priorities were integral to national development plans, and should be reflected as such in those plans and/or strategies for poverty reduction.

It is not business-to-business or business-to-consumer sales of tangible products effected through electronic networks that raise novel and difficult questions for the VAT, but rather business- to-business and business-to-consumer sales of digital products. Although the large majority of e-commerce transactions are business-to-business, it is the business-to-consumer sales of digital products which has drawn most attention. There is not yet any perfect system for the collection of indirect taxes on electronic deliveries. Consumers might have to self-assess how much VAT they are obliged to pay.

In examining the impact of e- commerce on consumption taxes, a distinction should be made between value added taxes (VAT) like those adopted by members of the European Union and the retail sales tax (RST) in force in the United States. The problems created by e-commerce for indirect taxation are in many ways analogous to those for direct taxation. For example, the jurisdictional problems of getting remote vendors into the taxing regimes are the same.","WTCOMTDM40.pdf","European, Union, United, States"
"4088",4088,"136","136.     A third problem for income tax regimes is the potential for transfer pricing. Defining the price of a physical good transferred between related enterprises might be difficult enough.

"4087",4087,"135","135.     Abandoning the source-based principle in favour of the residence-based principle in the context of e-commerce would violate accepted international norms of tax policy. In addition, it is by no means clear that residence-based taxation provides a panacea for the difficulties of assigning income from e-commerce on a source basis. A residence-based rule raises troublesome questions of international tax equity. A shift to residence-based taxation would be a boon to the United States as the world’s leader in the production of electronic content. The reduced need for a seller or service provider to have a physical presence in the country of the customer threaten to shift the balance of taxing jurisdiction and revenue in favour of the country of residence. Since income flows between developed and developing countries often are severely out of balance, such a shift could have significant revenue consequences.","WTCOMTDM40.pdf","United, States"
"4086",4086,"134","134.    Another problem for income tax regimes is the characterization of income. E-commerce is generating countless transactions that raise income characterization issues whose resolution is uncertain under existing categories of income. The characterization of income either as royalty income or as business profits might have important implications for developing countries and countries in transition. For example, a developed country company might have some kind of subsidiary in a developing country that uses and pays for the services of a database from the main company. The main company could then attempt to have that income classified as business profits in WT/COMTD/M/40 Page 30 order to avoid to pay tax in the developing country, claiming that it does not have any permanent establishment in that country. The developing country government could argue that the payment in question is royalty income and that it has the right to impose a withholding tax as the source of the royalty income would be the developing country. One important question with respect to direct taxes is thus what the appropriate rules are for the division of the taxable income between different countries.","WTCOMTDM40.pdf",""
"4085",4085,"133","133.    The difficulty of tracing transactions and verifying the parties to a transaction also enhances the danger of increased tax avoidance and evasion. Insofar as a jurisdiction is relying on the residence principle as the basis for taxation, e-commerce will provide enhanced opportunities to move income out of high-tax jurisdictions.

The implications of technological changes for territorially based taxed systems are vast, partly because of the sheer increase in the number of cross-boarder transactions. Second, the digitization of information creates difficulties in defining the source, origin and destination of both consumption and production. The principal challenge is therefore to determine how to implement geographically limited tax systems in a technological environment that renders geographical borders essentially irrelevant. E-commerce influences the operation of tax systems in several ways. It:         -       has the ability to establish public and private communication systems on a global                 basis;         -       reduces the need for intermediaries in business transactions;         -       enables encrypted communication;         -       integrates business functions such as design and production;         -       provides greater flexibility for international business organization; and it         -       leads to the physical disintegration of economic activities (location of supplier,                 provider, user, customer).","WTCOMTDM40.pdf",""

Deputy Director-General Miguel Rodriguez-Mendoza, who had worked on the design of the intensive training courses for senior policy makers, said that Annex I of the TA Plan called for the WT/COMTD/M/40 Page 4 initiation of a training programme on the Doha negotiations. The programme focussed on the training of trade negotiators of WTO Members and Observers from developing countries and economies in transition specifically on the issues central to the Doha Development Agenda. The main purpose was to strengthen those countries effective participation in the Doha negotiations and work programme through policy analysis and a deepened understanding of the issues involved. The Secretariat was in the process of implementing that programme which was complementary to other TA and capacity building activities included in the Annual TA Plan. The Secretariat was planning to conduct a series of two-week training activities on the Doha negotiations and Work Programme for government officials with responsibility in the Doha negotiations. The programme took into account the experience of a successful course that the WTO, together with the Organization of American States and the Georgetown University, had been conducting for the past five years. The Secretariat attempted to replicate that experience in other regions as part of the mandate for TA and capacity building adopted by the Ministers at Doha. The purpose of that programme was not to focus on an explanation of the WTO Agreements, but rather to concentrate on the Doha negotiating issues. In that sense, it was a pilot activity devoted to increasing the understanding of the negotiating issues and proposals, and to facilitate the participation of developing countries in the debate. To achieve that task, the Secretariat was not only counting on the expertise of its own staff, but also on that of independent experts and resource persons from the various regions. The Advanced Training Programme the Secretariat was working on would be implemented in two phases. In a first phase, the Secretariat contemplated to organize up to eight training activities. Two in Africa, two in Asia, two in Latin American and the Caribbean, one in Transition Economies and one for Arab countries. That first phase would cover the period from April 2002 to the Mexico Ministerial Conference. In the second phase of the programme, which extended between the Mexico Ministerial and the end of the negotiations, the intention was to organize a second set of training activities in all the regions involved. Although financing for those activities was secured by the Doha Development Agenda Global Trust Fund, the Secretariat was in the process of contacting some regional organizations, including regional development banks, as well as some academic institutions in the various regions to make the courses a joint effort by the institutions concerned. In preparation for those activities, he had been in touch with a number of delegations. Specifically, he had met with the African countries, with the CARICOM countries, with the CEFTA+ group and with China, and it was his intention to continue the dialogue with other developing country Members to get their insights and advise as to how to make the activities meaningful, and actually to strengthen the participation of developing countries in the negotiations. He had received support and enthusiasm for the programme from the countries concerned, and would keep the CTD informed of further developments regarding the implementation of the training activity.","WTCOMTDM40.pdf","Director-General, Miguel, Rodriguez-Mendoza, WTO, Members, Doha, Development, Agenda, Doha, Secretariat, Secretariat, Doha, Work, Programme, Doha, WTO, Organization, of, American, States, Georgetown, University, Secretariat, Doha, WTO, Doha, Secretariat, Secretariat, Secretariat, Africa, Asia, Caribbean, Mexico, Mexico, Doha, Development, Agenda, Global, Trust, Fund, Secretariat, CARICOM, CEFTA, China, Members, CTD"

The large majority of on-line trade is going to be business-to-business (including raw materials to manufacturing and manufactures to distribution) rather than business-to-consumer e-commerce. It will not only involve business-to-business trade in developed countries but also between developed and developing county companies and among developing country firms. Business- to-business e-commerce is shown to have taken off much faster than business-to-consumer trade. Reasons given include the diversity of consumers, geographical differences, and consumer concerns on security issues. Estimates suggest that over 90 per cent of e-commerce is business-to-business. Apart from business-to-business and business-to-consumer e-commerce, firms are also using e- commerce internally. E-business includes e-learning and e-collaboration where electronic contacts replace physical presence, always with the aim of reducing internal and external transaction costs and achieving better, quicker, safer and cost-efficient information flows. Even in ""physical"" activities such as building an oil field, information costs amount to 40 per cent of total costs.","WTCOMTDM40.pdf",""

In order to be competitive in a market where mergers and acquisitions are daily affairs, companies need to be global and use e-business. Globalisation of large business affects both developed and developing countries. It is becoming increasingly expensive to extract oil. It is therefore necessary to reduce costs to be competitive. One way is to reduce costs of extraction and refining. Another is to maximize the use of scarce and dispersed resources. New information and communication technologies (ICTs) are useful in that respect. Firms take advantage of the technical advances that ICTs provide and have completely different ways of transferring information than just a couple of years ago. They need to innovate with the use of modern technologies to lower transaction costs and improve market information to deal with intensified competition. ICTs are also used to identify best practices, to mitigate risks, and in training.","WTCOMTDM40.pdf","ICTs"

The information technology (IT) boom is over and doing business using electronic means is business as usual for the private sector. However, the decrease in the spending on e-commerce is not a sign of a lack of interest in information technologies on the part of company executives. It is rather due to the limited availability of financial resources. The private sector experimented with information technologies in the 1995-2000 period, which led to the over-spending that created the IT ""bubble"". Firms currently tend to spend on internal information technology rather than on external e-commerce. Nevertheless, the private sector expects to increase technology spending over the next few years.         4          WT/COMTD/35.         5           The WTO Work Programme on Electronic Commerce, adopted by the General Council on 25 September 1998, is contained in document WT/L/274.        6          The report of the 1999 seminar can be found in document WT/COMTD/18.        7           The report of the 2001 seminar is an attachment (beginning on page 32) to document WT/COMTD/M/35.

There was agreement that e-commerce is business as usual apart from the poorer developing countries who need to concentrate on the build up of human and physical infrastructure. Electronic commerce can provide additional opportunities for development, especially for developing countries losing their comparative advantage in traditional economic sectors. Some speakers said that many developing countries stand to gain much more by maintaining an environment in which electronic commerce can flourish, rather than introducing new, cumbersome and restrictive measures to tax digital products and services and that they should not stand in the way for the development of e-commerce.","WTCOMTDM40.pdf",""

The classification issue is important because of the structural differences between GATT and GATS. The levels of benefits under GATT can differ significantly from those available under GATS in the short term. Questions that need to be considered in this context include:         1.      What are the implications of e-commerce for the promotion of economic                 development and what are the implications for development of erecting barriers to e-                 commerce?         2.

It is not sales of tangible products carried out through electronic networks but rather sales of digital products that raise novel and difficult questions for the collection of consumption taxes. The implications of the technological changes for territorially based taxed systems are vast. First, there is the sheer increase in cross-boarder transactions. Second, the digitization of information creates difficulties in defining the source, origin and destination of both consumption and production. The principle challenge is to determine how to implement geographically limited tax systems in a technological environment that renders geographical borders essentially irrelevant. The difficulty of tracing transactions enhances the danger of increased tax avoidance and evasion. The most significant issues raised by the advent of e-commerce for income tax regimes are those relating to jurisdiction to tax and the characterization of income. The problems concerning the application of consumption taxes are generally recognized as having more immediacy than the issues concerning direct taxation.","WTCOMTDM40.pdf",""

"4036",4036,"9","9.      The representative of Zambia endorsed the statement made by Bangladesh, on behalf of the LLDCs. Discussions on whether the Uruguay Round had worsened the position of least-developed countries was a priority neither for Zambia nor for other least-developed countries. The economic decline in least-developed countries had not been arrested because of the successful conclusion of the Uruguay Round as these countries faced structural problems. The share of LLDCs' exports in world trade had declined from 0.6 per cent in 1975 to less than 0.3 per cent in 1992. Out of the over 40 LLDCs, only two (Zambia and Bangladesh) had exports in excess of $1 billion. Their share in world imports was negligible; in 1992, it amounted to less than 0.7 per cent. Unless something was done at both the domestic and international level, the trend would continue. Political will to do something tangible for least-developed countries was needed. Despite assurances given by almost every major intergovernmental institution to assist African and other poorer countries, no new or serious initiatives had been proposed. LLDCs were aware that to be part of the mainstream, much had to be done by them. In the first place it would require the adoption of market-tested policies and fiscal discipline.

They accepted trade as an engine of growth and were committed to export-oriented development strategies. Referring to the ongoing discussion, he said LLDCs should be granted credit by their trading partners for autonomous liberalization measures. The argument that credit could be given only when the measures were bound in the WTO ignored the fact that very few LLDCs reversed trade liberalization measures. The best guarantee against any such reversal was the discipline of markets. He requested trading partners to take into account domestic pressures they faced; by not binding all of their autonomous trading liberalization measures, LLDCs were able to carry their constituencies with them and continue with their reform programmes. He called for an ad-hoc solution, until a permanent solution was found to the issue of ""credit and recognition"".","WTCOMTDM4.pdf","Zambia, Bangladesh, LLDCs, Uruguay, Round, Zambia, Uruguay, LLDCs, LLDCs, Zambia, Bangladesh, LLDCs, Page, LLDCs, WTO, LLDCs, LLDCs"
"4035",4035,"8","8.       The Chairman said that the issue of credit and recognition for autonomous trade liberalization measures had been on the agenda of the Second Session of the CTD but had not been discussed exhaustively. While he did not want to influence the outcome of the discussion, the Chairman pointed out that paragraph 8 of document WT/COMTD/W/4 called for long-term measures to deal with this issue. The representative of Mexico said his delegation was interested in continuing the debate on ""credit and recognition"" as Members had varying views and had proposed different solutions during the Uruguay Round. He hoped that a consensus could be reached at this Fourth Session of the CTD.","WTCOMTDM4.pdf","Chairman, CTD, Chairman, Mexico, Members, Uruguay, Round, CTD"

"4033",4033,"60","60.      The Chairman thanked Members for their active participation and for their confidence in him. He assured them that he had taken careful note of all proposals and comments. He confirmed that a Working Group would be established to give clear directions to the Secretariat on issues to be analyzed in the light of proposals made by India, Singapore and other Members; membership of the Group would be open-ended. The Chairman declared the meeting closed.","WTCOMTDM4.pdf","Chairman, Members, Working, Group, Secretariat, India, Singapore, Members, Group, Chairman"

It would be left to the CTD to decide on the status of such provisions.","WTCOMTDM4.pdf","India, Secretariat, CTD"
"4031",4031,"59","59.      The Chairman said Rule 36bis of the CTD's Rules of Procedure, required that ""After the last meeting of the year, a report to the General Council on the activities of the Committee on Trade and Development during the year shall be adopted"". He suggested that Members entrust him with the responsibility of preparing the draft report, which would include, among other things, the work programme for 1996. Before submission to the General Council, he would circulate a draft to Members for their comments. The CTD so agreed. The Committee also agreed to authorize the Chairman to make an oral report to the GATT CONTRACTING PARTIES on the activities of the CTD for this year.","WTCOMTDM4.pdf","Chairman, CTD, General, Council, Committee, on, Trade, and, Development, Members, General, Council, Members, CTD, Committee, Chairman, GATT, CTD"
"4030",4030,"58","58.      The representative of Peru, referring to the decision to establish a Working Group to examine issues raised by Members, thought it would be appropriate to discuss the participation of developing countries in the international trading system at the next meeting of the CTD in March 1996. According to the draft work programme, the issue would not come up for discussion until October 1996 and in his delegation's view, that was too late. The discussion of Item B could be brought forward in order for the Working Group to make a significant contribution to the work of the CTD. Peru was willing to participate in the Working Group. The Chairman assured Peru that his proposal would be taken into account. He reminded Members to submit their proposals to amend the draft work programme in writing to the Secretariat. The Committee took note of the comments made.

Consultations were still in progress and his delegation wanted the matter to be included in the work programme for 1996. The Chairman said that as consultations were still going on, the Indian delegation could raise the matter next year under any appropriate item of the work programme.","WTCOMTDM4.pdf","India, Chairman"
"4028",4028,"56","56.     The Chairman then turned to the proposed work programme and invited preliminary comments from Members, and informed those who wished to propose amendments to the programme could do so in writing to the Secretariat. He would then thereafter hold consultations with Members on the proposed changes. He hoped to finalize the programme of work early and include it in the CTD's report to the General Council.","WTCOMTDM4.pdf","Chairman, Members, Secretariat, Members, CTD, General, Council"
"4027",4027,"55","55.       The Chairman then recalled that the CTD was responsible for the notification requirements of Article XVIII: A, C and D, Part IV and the Enabling Clause. The Secretariat had responded to a request made at the Second Session that relevant documents containing notification obligations relating to development issues and past decisions of the CTD on the subject be circulated to Members. These documents were available in the room. Suggesting that the CTD address the notification requirements at its first meeting in 1996, he hoped the discussion would clarify which notification obligations were relevant to the CTD, and whether there was the need to have standard formats for notifications.","WTCOMTDM4.pdf","Chairman, CTD, Secretariat, CTD, Members, CTD"
"4026",4026,"54","54.       The Chairman reminded Members that the terms of reference of the CTD required it ""to establish a programme of work which may be reviewed as necessary each year"". The draft work programme for 1996 basically followed the work programme of 1995, and included tentative dates for the meetings of the CTD in 1996. Regarding the two items of the 1995 work programme which were not included in the terms of reference of the CTD, i.e. review of the impact of the Uruguay Round on developing country Members and the issue of credit and recognition, he suggested that the proposed work programme for 1996 carry an explicit reference to the impact of the Uruguay Round. The issue of credit and recognition could, he thought, be discussed under ""Consideration of Measures and Initiatives to Assist the Expansion of Trade and Investment Opportunities of Developing Country Members, in particular on the Least-Developed Country Members""; it was not necessary for specific reference to be made to it in the programme of work.","WTCOMTDM4.pdf","Chairman, Members, CTD, CTD, CTD, Uruguay, Round, Members, Uruguay, Round, Expansion, of, Trade, and, Investment, Opportunities, of, Developing, Country, Members, Members"

The representative of Norway thanked the Chairperson of the Sub-Committee for her accurate report on the meeting and said that the debate in the CTD had underscored the fact that the Sub- Committee had an important task to perform. He informed Members that his delegation was holding consultations with the Secretariat to develop guidelines for getting the best use out of the Fund. An interesting proposal made by the Secretariat was being studied in Oslo and Members would be informed as soon as a decision was taken. He encouraged contributions from other countries to the Trust Fund, WT/COMTD/M/4 Page 14 which could do much to increase and strengthen the participation of developing countries in the multilateral trading system. He welcomed the EC's initiative to hold regional seminars for the ACP countries. The Committee took note of the comments made.","WTCOMTDM4.pdf","Norway, Chairperson, CTD, Sub, -, Committee, Members, Secretariat, Secretariat, Oslo, Members, EC, ACP, Committee"
"4024",4024,"52","52.     The representative of Bangladesh thanked the Chairperson for her statement. He drew attention to the declining share of LLDCs in world trade and the drop in their GDP per capita and said that it was absolutely necessary that something be done for these countries. As the problems of LLDCs were within public knowledge, he did not think further elaboration was necessary.","WTCOMTDM4.pdf","Bangladesh, Chairperson, LLDCs, LLDCs"
"4023",4023,"51","51.     The representative of Egypt thanked the Norwegian government for setting up a technical assistance fund in the WTO. He found the amended GSP scheme notified by the EC very confusing. They were currently studying its details, although his country's exports were covered by a bilateral agreement. It had been brought to the attention of his delegation by UNCTAD that Australia had decided to phase out its GSP scheme for developing countries, with the exception of LLDCs and small-island states. The decision was regrettable. The representative of Australia said her country had notified the changes to its GSP scheme. As aspects of the new scheme seemed to be unclear to some Members, she had additional material on the scheme which she could share with them. 51.      The Chairperson of the Sub-Committee on Least-Developed Countries said the First Meeting of the Sub-Committee had taken place on 17 October 1995. The details of the proceedings could be found in WT/COMTD/LLDC/1. The meeting was well attended and, in her view, the general level of interest showed by Members demonstrated the seriousness accorded to the Marrakesh commitment to ensure the effective participation of LLDCs in the multilateral trading system. The Sub-Committee adopted its Programme of Work which was designed primarily to facilitate the full integration of LLDCs into the multilateral trading system. She hoped to carry out consultations on items that would be accorded ""priority status"" at the next meeting of the Sub-Committee in February 1996. The Work Programme represented a considerable challenge, and she was sure the Members of the Sub-Committee would work together to produce constructive results. She underlined the importance of technical assistance to LLDCs and said it would continue to play a vital role in enabling them to make the most of the opportunities and challenges of the post-Uruguay Round trading environment. She noted that the Norwegian initiative in establishing a technical assistance fund in the WTO for the benefit of LLDCs was widely commended by the Members of the Sub-Committee. The representatives of UNCTAD, ITC and the Technical Cooperation and Training Division informed the Sub-Committee of work in progress of special relevance to LLDCs. She urged Members of the CTD to be ready to play their full part in meeting the heavy responsibilities assigned to the Sub-Committee. Practical results could be achieved, she said, if Members worked together with determination.","WTCOMTDM4.pdf","Egypt, WTO, EC, UNCTAD, Australia, LLDCs, Australia, Members, Chairperson, WT/COMTD/LLDC, Members, Marrakesh, LLDCs, Sub-Committee, Work, Programme, Members, LLDCs, WTO, LLDCs, Members, UNCTAD, ITC, Technical, Cooperation, and, Training, Division, Members, CTD, Members"

The representatives of Cuba and Peru supported India's proposal that an analysis be carried out by the Secretariat on the legal status of the special provisions in favour of developing countries.

Her delegation greatly appreciated the Director-General's personal commitment to assisting African countries to increase their exports and take advantage of the opportunities offered by the Uruguay Round, and for setting up a Programme of Action for Africa. She also greatly appreciated the financial support extended by Norway and the European Communities and their willingness to assist Africa and other countries to benefit from the multilateral trading system.

"4019",4019,"48","48.      The representative of Bangladesh asked if the WTO technical assistance fund had been established and if so, wished to have details about its operation. The Director of the Technical Cooperation and Training Division said the fund had not yet been established; a detailed plan had been submitted to the Norwegian government and the Fund could start operating shortly after the adoption of a positive decision by them.","WTCOMTDM4.pdf","Bangladesh, WTO, Director, Technical, Cooperation, and, Training, Division"
"4018",4018,"47","47.      The representative of Switzerland said she had not had the opportunity to study in detail the document prepared by the Secretariat as they had received it the day before the meeting; she expected to comment on the document at the next meeting of the CTD. She then said that demands for technical assistance were growing, and so were the activities of institutions engaged in providing technical assistance. As this increased the prospect of duplication of functions, it was absolutely necessary to coordinate these various activities to ensure that resources were deployed to maximum benefit. The idea of diversification was important and was being studied and analyzed in many institutions such as UNCTAD, FAO and the World Bank. She reiterated that an efficient management of resources required proper coordination of activities. The new multilateral trading environment required the adaptation and intensification of programmes for technical assistance and cooperation. Her government was in the process of reviewing its trade policies to meet these new challenges. The revision of their GSP scheme was but one aspect of this review. She said that Switzerland, in cooperation with the UNCTAD Secretariat, would soon hold a seminar on ""Technical Cooperation for Trade and Development in the Face of Globalization"". The seminar was aimed at identifying concrete policies to facilitate the integration of developing countries and countries-in-transition into the multilateral trading system. In addition, the seminar would attempt to identify technical cooperation requirements flowing from the Uruguay Round Agreements, and to focus specifically on how such assistance could be delivered. The seminar would also consider and clarify the role of each institution in the delivery of technical assistance. It was expected that the conclusions of the seminar would be part of the background material for UNCTAD IX.

"4017",4017,"46","46.     The representative of Cuba while expressing his appreciation for the technical assistance activities of the WTO, said he agreed with Tanzania and Bangladesh that technical assistance should be increased and targeted at capacity-building and other practical initiatives which would assist developing countries to increase their exports and take advantage of the opportunities presented by the Uruguay Round. He encouraged the Secretariat to pursue the matter with other institutions with a capability to assist in these goals, so that resources could be used to maximum advantage. He stressed the importance of regional and sub-regional seminars on subjects such as notification requirements, in helping developing countries benefit from the multilateral trading system. He was encouraged by the gesture of the European Communities and hoped that his country would be able to participate in the seminar to be organized in the Caribbean region.","WTCOMTDM4.pdf","Cuba, WTO, Tanzania, Bangladesh, Uruguay, Secretariat, Caribbean"
"4016",4016,"45","45.     The representative of the European Communities said that, in 1996, they would be organizing, with the cooperation of the ACP and the WTO Secretariat, eight regional seminars in the ACP countries at a cost of about ECU 1.1 million. Six seminars would be held in the African region and fifty- four countries were expected to participate; one would be held in the Caribbean and another in the Pacific, with fifteen and eight countries expected to participate, respectively. Each country would be represented by two government officials and two representatives from the private sector. The main purpose of the seminars was to acquaint and increase the understanding of trade policymakers and businessmen of the results of the Uruguay Round. The trading opportunities and the general economic impact of the Uruguay Round would be analyzed in that context. The seminars would aim at identifying policy measures needed to get maximum benefit from post-Uruguay Round opportunities. A brief description of the programme, he said, could be found in the background document prepared by the Secretariat.","WTCOMTDM4.pdf","European, Communities, ACP, WTO, Secretariat, ACP, Caribbean, Pacific, Uruguay, Uruguay, Round, Secretariat"
"4015",4015,"44","44.     The representative of Bangladesh said the function of the WTO technical assistance programme should not, as now, be directed at acquainting Members with WTO rules. He asked that the programme be structured to give practical assistance to LLDCs to increase their exports and take advantage of the Uruguay Round; it should take account of the development dimension. Practical measures were needed to increase the participation of LLDCs in the international trading system. Supporting Tanzania, he strongly urged the Secretariat to pursue the suggestions made by its representative.","WTCOMTDM4.pdf","Bangladesh, WTO, Members, WTO, Uruguay, LLDCs, Tanzania, Secretariat"
"4014",4014,"43","43.      The representative of Tanzania endorsed the statement earlier made by Bangladesh, on behalf of LLDCs, and associated his delegation with the statements by Zambia, India and Singapore. In the recent past, Tanzania had benefited from seminars organized by the Secretariat, and had received assistance on its notification and other obligations arising from WTO Agreement. His delegation appreciated the efforts and commitment of the Director-General to mobilize additional resources for technical assistance, especially for least-developed countries. Welcoming warmly the contribution of Norway in establishing a technical assistance Trust Fund in the WTO, he requested other donor countries to contribute to the Fund. Past assistance given to countries in the preparation of their Uruguay Round commitments and seminars on the implications of the Round were helpful. What was necessary now, was assistance to increase exports and to take advantage of the opportunities offered by the successful conclusion of the Round. He suggested that efforts should now focus on capacity-building and practical initiatives aimed at horizontal and vertical diversification of production and export structures. He said that the notion of ""demand-driven technical assistance"" should not prevent the Secretariat from being proactive; from advising countries on the nature of technical assistance they would need to make use of the opportunities in the international trading system. He stressed the importance of closer collaboration between the WTO and other institutions in the design and implementation of technical assistance programmes. Relevant organizations with which closer cooperation should be pursued included UNCTAD and ITC, and institutions such as the IMF, World Bank, European Communities, the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO), the United Nations Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO) and the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO).

The Chairman noted that with respect to the special provisions in the Multilateral Trade Agreements and Associated Legal Texts, WT/COMTD/W/10 was an important reference document as it sets out, among other things, provisions which were action-oriented.

"4011",4011,"40","40.     The representative of Mexico suggested that donor countries use an electronic medium, such as the ""Internet"", to disseminate information on their GSP schemes. Details should be available in a simple user-friendly format that could be easily accessed by interested persons or firms. He was aware that some donor countries were seriously studying this possibility, and requested representatives of those present at the meeting to provide information on steps being taken by them.","WTCOMTDM4.pdf","Mexico"

The representative of India said he did not want to go into the details of the positive and negative aspects of the Round as this subject had been discussed on so many occasions. He did, however, want to raise the issue of the legal value of the ""special and differential provisions"" in the Uruguay Round Agreements. While the provisions giving longer time-periods for developing countries to implement their obligations did not raise any difficulties, the same could not be said of other provisions. For instance, he had been told that a provision which provided that a product under restraint should not be subjected to anti-dumping duties had no legal value. He was concerned that the special and differential provisions in Uruguay Round Agreements would not lead to enforceable legal rights. Developing countries had undertaken substantial obligations thinking that they could rely on such provisions. He requested the Secretariat to compile a list of the provisions which, prima facie, provided for special and differential treatment to developing countries and to indicate whether they were legally enforceable. He was not asking for any specific judgments, but rather a professional, objective and analytical listing of the provisions.","WTCOMTDM4.pdf","India, Uruguay, Uruguay, Secretariat"
"4009",4009,"39","39.      The representative of Japan said thirteen countries had been designated as new beneficiaries under their amended GSP Scheme. The criteria for determining eligibility for preferential status were that the economy of the country or territory should be in the process of development; the country should be a member of UNCTAD; the country or territory should be willing to have preferential status                                                                              WT/COMTD/M/4                                                                              Page 11 under Japan's GSP scheme; and a cabinet order should proclaim that the benefits be extended to the country or territory. A country fulfilling these criteria would be declared a beneficiary. Japan accepted that there had been erosion of preferences due to Uruguay Round tariff reductions. However, Japan believed that such reductions, along with the higher level of bindings, offered increased stability and predictability in the trading system. Drawing attention to the many benefits resulting from the successful conclusion of the Uruguay Round, he added that GSP schemes were voluntary and donor countries had no obligation to compensate for loss of preferential margins. Notwithstanding that Japan had, on a voluntary basis, introduced improvements under their GSP scheme following the successful conclusion of the Uruguay Round, and reduced the preferential tariff rates for a number of agricultural products including twelve tropical products.","WTCOMTDM4.pdf","Japan, UNCTAD, Page, 11, Japan, Japan, Uruguay, Japan, Uruguay, GSP, Japan, Uruguay, Round"
"4008",4008,"38","38.     The representative of the European Communities said they had notified their amended GSP scheme to the Secretariat, and a copy of the relevant EC Council Regulation could be obtained from the Secretariat. Addressing the concerns expressed by India and Bangladesh on the inclusion of environmental and labour standards in the new GSP scheme of the EC and other countries, he said it was not the intention of the EC to penalize countries. The new EC scheme offered additional benefits to developing countries which complied with such standards; margins of preferences were not reduced, if countries did not meet the standards. The five year validity of the new EC scheme added predictability. The scheme aimed at maintaining existing margins of preferences through the mechanisms of modulation and of graduation. Preferential margins ranged from 15 per cent to 100 per cent depending on the sensitivity of the products. There were no quantitative restrictions. To protect as much as possible the margins of preferences enjoyed by countries under the previous scheme, the new margins of preferences would be applied to bound rates. The new scheme allowed the EC to withdraw preferences for some countries in certain specific sectors, under certain conditions. Preferences could, for example, be withdrawn if exports constituted 25 per cent of total exports to the EC. The objective of the new graduation policy was not to penalize ""successful"" countries, but to redistribute margins of preferences in a way that improved competitiveness of countries which most needed GSP benefits.","WTCOMTDM4.pdf","European, Communities, GSP, Secretariat, EC, Council, Regulation, Secretariat, India, Bangladesh, EC, EC, EC, EC, EC, EC, GSP"
"4007",4007,"37","37.     The representative of Norway said the revised GSP scheme of Norway was summarized in WT/COMTD/N/6. Norway had seized the opportunities presented by the successful conclusion of the Uruguay Round and revamped its GSP scheme by improving the concessions to developing countries, especially to the least-developed among them. While improved market access under GSP schemes was important and could assist diversification of exports, Norway believed the integration of developing countries into the multilateral trading system required the adoption of appropriate economic and social policies and good management of the economy. Norway wanted developing countries to see GSP schemes from that perspective.","WTCOMTDM4.pdf","Norway, Norway, Norway, Uruguay, Round, GSP, Norway, Norway"

The present Swiss scheme accorded duty-free entry to industrial products exported by LLDCs. Every effort was being made to increase concessions in the agricultural sector, and it was likely that some new products in this sector of export interest to LLDCs would be included. In addition to improving market access conditions for LLDCs, the revised Swiss scheme would respect the cardinal rules of transparency and predictability.","WTCOMTDM4.pdf","Switzerland, LLDCs, LLDCs, LLDCs"

Copies of the Treaty were available in the Secretariat. The Treaty was signed on 5 November 1993 and ratified by a group of fifteen African countries on 8 December 1994. The current members of COMESA were Angola, Burundi, Comoros Islands, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Kenya, Lesotho, Malawi, Mauritius, Rwanda, Sudan, Swaziland, Tanzania, Uganda, Zaire, Zambia and Zimbabwe. The COMESA Treaty superseded the Preferential Trade Area for Eastern and Southern African States (PTA), and dealt with a broad range of subjects including cooperation in economic and social sectors. The Treaty aimed to promote a balanced and harmonious development of production and marketing structures, and the sustainable growth and development of its member states. COMESA aimed to raise the standard of living of the citizens of its member state, foster closer relations among its member states through joint adoption of macro-economic policies and programmes, and cooperation in all fields of economic activity. It provided for free movement of persons and the WT/COMTD/M/4 Page 10 right of establishment of business by nationals of member states. It also aimed to establish a customs union within a transitional period of ten years. COMESA was based on the principles of ""open regionalism"", it did not introduce any barriers to trade and it was firmly anchored in the multilateral system of trade. Queries or comments on the Treaty could be channelled through the Secretariat. COMESA was committed to the principle of transparency and would respond promptly.","WTCOMTDM4.pdf","Zambia, Members, WT/COMTD/N, Secretariat, COMESA, Angola, Burundi, Comoros, Islands, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Kenya, Lesotho, Malawi, Mauritius, Rwanda, Sudan, Swaziland, Tanzania, Uganda, Zaire, Zambia, Zimbabwe, COMESA, COMESA, Secretariat, COMESA"
"4004",4004,"34","34.     The representative of India wondered whether the recent introduction of multi-layered preference schemes had the effect of nullifying benefits granted under them. In his view new elements introduced into some GSP schemes did not pay sufficient regard to fundamental concepts such as non-reciprocity and non-discrimination. He thought a study by the Secretariat on the ramifications of the new elements in some of these newly implemented GSP schemes might be helpful and that such a study should be done in coordination with UNCTAD which had considerable expertise in this area. He agreed with the Australian representative that work done by other institutions should not be duplicated. The representative of Bangladesh said his delegation, like India, was concerned about the design of some new GSP schemes. New conditionalities that were being imposed, especially in the area of environment, had the effect of negating benefits under such schemes. This placed weaker countries at a serious disadvantage.","WTCOMTDM4.pdf","India, GSP, Secretariat, GSP, UNCTAD, Bangladesh, India"

But now the subject of discussion was the participation of developing countries in the international trading system, and it was necessary to know why the share of some countries in world trade was declining. If the suggestion that restrictive business practices of transnational corporations should be looked into was objectionable and unacceptable to some Members, it could be dropped. However, it was his conviction that the CTD should look at the impact safeguard measures, environmental standards, phytosanitary and sanitary measures were having on the performance of developing countries in the multilateral trading system. 32.      The Chairman said under this agenda item, discussions should cover the implementation of GATT 1994 Part IV and the Enabling Clause, and the special provisions in the Multilateral Trade Agreements and Related Ministerial Decisions and Declarations. Under Part IV and the Enabling Clause there were two sub-items; first, preferential arrangements among developing countries, and second, changes in some GSP schemes. A notification from the Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA), circulated in WT/COMTD/N/3, provided information on the establishment a new regional grouping, and another from the Association of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN) in WT/COMTD/3 provided information on the ASEAN Free-Trade Area. Recent notifications by some Members of changes in their GSP schemes were contained in WTO documents WT/COMTD/N/1, 2, 4, 5 and 6, and their corresponding addenda and corrigenda. WT/COMTD/W/11/Add.1 provided a Secretariat summary of the notified changes in GSP schemes.","WTCOMTDM4.pdf","India, Members, CTD, Chairman, Southern, Africa, COMESA, Association, of, South, East, Asian, Nations, ASEAN, ASEAN, Members, WTO, Secretariat"

A significant input from CTD members would be necessary to ensure the practical usefulness of the study. Supporting the proposal made by the Chairman to establish a Working Group, he said he had a vested interest, as the findings and conclusions of the CTD could provide policy guidance for consideration by Ministers when they meet in Singapore in December 1996. He added that the marginalization of LLDCs in the international                                                                           WT/COMTD/M/4                                                                           Page 9 trading system was an issue of grave concern to the international trading community, and Ministers were committed in various Decisions and Declarations to working towards their integration into the multilateral trading system. He was ready to play a positive role in the proposed Working Group. The Committee took note of the comments made and agreed to establish such a Working Group. Saying he was ready to serve on the Working Group, the Chairman emphasized the need for clear directions to the Secretariat on the issues to be studied and analyzed.","WTCOMTDM4.pdf","Singapore, Secretariat, CTD, Chairman, Working, Group, CTD, Singapore, LLDCs, Working, Group, Committee, Working, Group, Working, Group, Chairman, Secretariat"

The Chairman stated that while there was a common denominator on the need for examining the participation of developing countries in the international trading system from a qualitative perspective, it was not clear whether Members wanted a Working Group established or a study done by the Secretariat. He was therefore proposing the establishment of a Working Group to guide the Secretariat in the preparation of the study. Membership of the Group would be open to any interested Members. It would not carry out research on the relevant issues but direct the Secretariat on what should be done. He invited Members to present ideas for such study so that appropriate terms of reference could be drawn up. The CTD could analyze conclusions reached in such a study, and make appropriate recommendations to the General Council.","WTCOMTDM4.pdf","Chairman, Members, Working, Group, Secretariat, Working, Group, Secretariat, Group, Members, Secretariat, Members, CTD, General, Council"

The Work Programme of the CTD and the Agreement Establishing the World Trade Organization (WTO), required it to review the special provisions relating to developing countries and to make recommendations to the General Council, and expectations were very high that the Committee would fulfil its mandate. He said document WT/COMTD/W/11 showed the declining share of least-developed countries (LLDCs) in world trade and that GDP per capita of LLDCs had fallen. The combination of these trends confirmed the marginalization of LLDCs in the international trading system. While the primary responsibility for development was with the LLDCs, the international community was committed by Ministers at Marrakesh to adopt positive measures to assist them in increasing their trade and investment opportunities. LLDCs were disappointed that no concrete measures had been adopted at recent meetings and global conferences. Losses for LLDCs through the erosion of preferences had been predicted in the 1995 Least-Developed Countries' Report published by UNCTAD. While the preferential treatment provided by GSP schemes was appreciated, there needed to be an assessment of gains and losses, so policymakers could formulate appropriate policy responses. WT/COMTD/W/10 was a useful document as it listed measures to increase the trade and investment opportunities of LLDCs. He thought it would be helpful if the Secretariat evaluated the impact of those measures on individual countries. This would assist the formulation of appropriate policy-responses. Expressing his appreciation for the technical assistance programme implemented by the WTO, he said more assistance was needed. The generous gesture of the Norwegian government in setting up a Trust Fund in the WTO was, he said, a step in the right direction.

The representative of Cuba welcomed the ongoing discussion and said the CTD should examine the reasons for the non-performance of some regions and developing countries, and propose effective solutions. Supporting the proposal made by India, he said he also found the ASEAN proposal very interesting. Citing the example of the unequal treatment of developing countries in the GSP schemes of certain countries, he disagreed with the representative of the European Communities that all developing countries faced the same market access conditions. He had no objection to the study extending to investment which was a dynamic aspect of development. The representative of Australia said care should be taken not to duplicate work done by other institutions.

"3997",3997,"28","28.      The representative of Singapore said the critical question that arose from the interesting debate was why some regions and developing countries were not benefiting from the multilateral trading system. The CTD should analyze carefully the variations in performance of the regions and individual countries. The reasons for the decline in the share of world trade of African and Middle Eastern countries might not be due to a singular cause, such as market access difficulties or restrictive trade regulations. Given that the share of Asian and Latin American countries had increased, he was inclined to agree with the representative of the European Communities, that the differences in performance could be due to structural rigidities. ASEAN countries favoured the establishment of a Working Group to look into this issue and report to the CTD. Despite studies carried out by other institutions, it was necessary for the CTD to gain an insight into the problems facing developing countries, so it could propose appropriate policy responses. He offered delegates copies of a paper which touched on the issue under review.","WTCOMTDM4.pdf","Singapore, CTD, ASEAN, Working, Group, CTD, CTD"

The representative of Peru expressed his support for the proposal made by India and said the CTD should not be satisfied with a document which only reproduced figures; it rather had to analyze the reasons for the lack of competitiveness of developing countries in the international trading system. The dynamism of international trade was affected by the participation of developing countries and this was a matter of importance to all Members of the WTO.

The representative of the European Communities observed that while some developing countries were making substantial progress, the same could not be said of countries in Africa and the Middle East. The declining share in world trade of these countries was of concern to the European Communities. While his delegation appreciated the spirit in which the proposal by India was made, he doubted whether such a study would explain why countries in East Asia performed better than other developing countries, WT/COMTD/M/4 Page 8 especially considering that almost all of them faced the same market access conditions in developed countries. Also, he wondered whether the CTD could not use studies already prepared on the subject, instead of initiating new ones. The evidence suggested that it was not the trading policies of developed countries that were to be blamed, but the economic policies and other conditions in the non-performing countries.","WTCOMTDM4.pdf","European, Communities, Africa, Middle, East, India, East, Asia, Page, 8, CTD"
"3994",3994,"25","25.      The representative of Canada, noting the exceptional performance of developing countries as a group in the international trading system, drew attention to the variations in the performance of countries. The dynamism shown by many developing countries in the last five to ten years had been remarkable. If present trends were sustained, they would continue to increase their share in world trade. The special situation of LLDCs needed to be recognized as they might not share in the benefits of the Uruguay Round. Commenting on the proposal made by India, he did not object to the principle, but was of the view that the CTD should not address subjects of interests to only developing countries. Agreeing with the representative of Ghana on the importance of investment, he said that if a study could be carried out on restrictive business practices, it could also address the treatment of foreign direct investment by host countries. Such a study would interest developed countries who were not always given the same treatment as nationals of the host state.","WTCOMTDM4.pdf","Canada, LLDCs, Uruguay, Round, India, CTD, Ghana"

Countries which received substantial investments produced goods and services for the global market place and increased their participation in the international trading system. While technical assistance aimed at institutional and capacity-building were appreciated by developing countries, the importance of resource inflows had to be recognized.","WTCOMTDM4.pdf","Ghana"
"3992",3992,"23","23.     The representative of India agreed with Norway that the fundamental issue was that of market access for products of export interest to developing countries. The performance of developing countries had not been uniform, and some regions had fared better than others; the picture for African and Middle                                                                             WT/COMTD/M/4                                                                             Page 7 Eastern countries was, he said, on the whole very dismal. The CTD had to recognize that developed countries should improve market access conditions for products of export interest to developing countries. He thought a coherent analysis would assist policymakers to design and implement the necessary measures to assist these countries. It was necessary to consider why developing countries had not increased their share of world trade, and to catalogue the problems inhibiting them from participating effectively in the multilateral trading system. The Secretariat could assist the CTD in its evaluation of this subject by undertaking a detailed study, analyzing the share in world trade of developing countries in major product categories - especially the ones in which they had traditionally enjoyed a comparative advantage - identifying if their shares in these product categories were increasing or decreasing and why it was so. This study could also examine the impact of technical standards, health and environmental regulations, sanitary and phytosanitary measures, and safeguard measures on the performance of developing countries in important sectors such as textiles and clothing. It could also examine the effects of restrictive business practices of transnational corporations. Such a comprehensive study would, in his view, benefit all WTO Members. The CTD needed to do more than just take note of the performance of developing countries in the international trading system, and a study such as the one proposed would show the very many problems facing developing countries. A forward-looking and analytical approach was needed, he said, so the CTD could address the problems facing developing countries. The representative of Venezuela expressed his support for the proposal made by India.","WTCOMTDM4.pdf","India, Norway, CTD, Secretariat, CTD, WTO, Members, CTD, CTD, Venezuela, India"
"3991",3991,"22","22.      The representative of Norway said the background document prepared by the Secretariat gave a clear overview of the current trends in world trade, and of the increasing participation of developing countries in the international trading system. The document also showed clearly that economies of developing countries as a group were the most dynamic in the world economy. In recent years, their performance had helped recovery of the global economy and contributed to its sustainability. While the integration of developing countries into the world economy should be a priority for the international trading system, the position of least-developed and other poorer countries merited special consideration. These countries had failed to benefit from a more open international trading system and unless the international community took immediate steps to increase their trading opportunities, they would be further marginalized in the world economy. While the WTO was not the place to discuss financial aid or debt relief, trade-related technical assistance and market access for products of export interest to LLDCs were within the mandate of the WTO. Pointing out the possibilities for special and differential treatment for LLDCs under GSP schemes after the tariffication introduced by the Agreement on Agriculture, he said Norway had taken action and expected other countries to do likewise. He urged more advanced developing countries and countries-in-transition to give special treatment to the exports of LLDCs so as to increase world trade. Improved market access conditions for textiles could also enhance greatly the participation of developing countries, especially LLDCs in the multilateral trading system. Increased trade-related technical assistance to developing countries would improve and deepen knowledge of WTO rules and enhance capacity-building in these countries and equip them to take advantage of the opportunities offered by the Uruguay Round. Assistance should be targeted at export- promotion programmes and at identifying new market opportunities for products of export interest to developing countries. Organizations such as the World Bank, IMF, ITC and UNCTAD were providing technical assistance in their spheres of competence, and, as had been noted by Ministers in the various declarations and decisions adopted at Marrakesh, further coherence in policy advice and assistance was necessary.","WTCOMTDM4.pdf","Norway, Secretariat, WTO, LLDCs, WTO, LLDCs, Norway, LLDCs, WTO, Uruguay, Round, World, Bank, IMF, ITC, UNCTAD, Marrakesh"

The representative of India referred to the statements that granting of credit would upset the balance of rights and obligations between developed and developing countries in the WTO, and that it was in the interest of developing countries to adopt these measures. He pointed out that it was not a universally accepted view that such measures benefited developing countries; the issue always drove a wedge between various interest groups in these countries. As stated in paragraph 12 of the background document, ""receiving credit and recognition for liberalization measures would help them in resisting domestic pressure not to liberalize trade, and would be an incentive for the continuation of such policies"". Operationalizing the concept so that it did not run counter to GATT/WTO principles would not be an easy task and he requested that the issue be maintained on the agenda of the CTD, until a solution satisfactory to all Members was found. Supporting India's comments, the representative of Mexico said that if credit was given for autonomous liberalization measures, this would encourage many countries to reduce or eliminate differences between applied and bound rates of duty. Expressing disappointment with the lack of progress, he asked Members to be flexible and constructive on this issue. The Committee took note of the comments made, including the requests that this issue be maintained on WT/COMTD/M/4 Page 6 the agenda of the CTD.

The representative of Switzerland, while welcoming measures to liberalize a trading regime, said the adoption of such measures outside multilateral trade negotiations was influenced by economic circumstances and political considerations. Switzerland was in agreement with the European Communities that it was imperative that any proposed solution be consistent with basic principles of the WTO such as m.f.n., transparency and predictability. Such principles enabled trading partners to plan ahead and make necessary judgments. They were needed to ensure the stability of the multilateral trading system and were reflected in the requirement that all measures be bound in the WTO. Granting concessions for unbound liberalization measures would be contrary to the spirit of the WTO Agreement.","WTCOMTDM4.pdf","Switzerland, Switzerland, WTO, WTO, WTO"

The representative of New Zealand thought it would be extremely difficult to devise a mechanism that would provide a real incentive to developing countries to adopt liberalization measures. His country had adopted extensive reforms in recent years, and he felt autonomous liberalization measures were more likely to be adopted because of domestic interests than because of benefits from trading partners. He emphasized the need for any solution to be WTO consistent, in particular with the m.f.n. principle. He agreed with the European Communities that concepts such as TTC and CTC in the Secretariat document could raise problems related to transparency and predictability. His delegation wished to reflect further on Zambia's interesting statement. However, he found it difficult to understand why developing countries had a problem with the proposition that credit could only be given for bound measures when they had abandoned import substitution policies and protectionism, and committed themselves to a market economy in order to participate fully in the multilateral trading system.","WTCOMTDM4.pdf","New, Zealand, WTO, CTC, Secretariat, Zambia"
"3984",3984,"16","16.    The representative of Bangladesh thought the term ""autonomous trade liberalization measures"" was a misnomer as developing countries were coerced by the Bretton Woods Institutions to adopt such measures.

"3983",3983,"15","15.      The representative of Japan said his delegation welcomed autonomous liberalization measures adopted by developing countries. While he thought it was important that other countries encouraged developing countries to continue with their liberalization efforts which often met with domestic resistance, the approach adopted during the Uruguay Round should be seen against the background of the special circumstances that existed at that time. Concessions were motivated partly by the desire to enhance the participation of developing countries in market access negotiations on goods. There had been a ground swell of support at the time to partly set aside the cardinal principle of reciprocity, in recognition                                                                              WT/COMTD/M/4                                                                              Page 5 of the special position of developing countries. To continue to do so would undermine the practical effectiveness of WTO principles. Moreover, it was very difficult to assess the value of autonomous liberalization measures which were taken in response to special group interests or in response to trading partners. This was why the Chairman of the Market Access Group presented guidelines rather than formal rules. These guidelines were not intended as rules to be followed subsequently. Developing countries already enjoyed, within the framework of the WTO, many benefits not available to other countries, and Japan was of the view that granting credit and recognition only to developing countries would affect the balance of rights and obligations between developed and developing countries. The representative of the United States supported the positions adopted by the European Communities and Japan on this issue.","WTCOMTDM4.pdf","Japan, Uruguay, Round, WTO, Chairman, Market, Access, Group, WTO, Japan, United, States, European, Communities, Japan"
"3982",3982,"14","14.      Expressing his appreciation for the background document prepared by the Secretariat the representative of the European Communities recalled that at the Second Session, they had outlined albeit in a preliminary manner, their views on the issue of credit and recognition. They were of the view that liberalization measures had been taken into account in the Uruguay Round, and were reflected in the overall results of the negotiations on market access. He thought some of the views expressed in the background document were untenable and premature. This was especially so for the suggestion of mini-cycles of negotiations; they would probably be outside the terms of reference of the CTD. While commending countries adopting autonomous liberalization measures, he believed such measures served the interests of those countries more than their trading partners; they could congratulate themselves and look forward to an improvement in their economies. Considering the level of developing countries' bound tariffs, there was much scope for further liberalization. He thought the proposal for a Concessional Tariff Concession (CTC) or a Temporary Tariff Concession (TTC) to be accorded, not on an m.f.n. basis but an individual basis, raised the issue of the consistency with fundamental rules of the WTO such as non-discrimination, predictability and transparency. The proposal was ill- conceived and should be discarded.","WTCOMTDM4.pdf","Secretariat, European, Communities, Uruguay, Round, WTO"
"3981",3981,"13","13.      Recalling that his delegation was one of the co-sponsors of the proposal made by Mexico in 1990, the representative of Peru said it was important for his delegation that the issue remained on the agenda of the CTD until a satisfactory solution was found. His delegation supported the request made by Morocco that a detailed informal paper be prepared by the Secretariat and thought such a paper should be comprehensive and elaborate on the ideas proposed in paragraphs 13 and 17 of the background document. The representative of Cote d'Ivoire recalled the strong support given by her delegation during the Uruguay Round to the concept of credit and recognition. For her delegation, the issue had additional importance because it would concretize the concept of coherence between the WTO and the Bretton Woods Institutions. The argument that credit could be given only for bound measures, ignored the benefits to trading partners from such measures. Granting credit for such measures would not only be equitable, but would also underline the seriousness of developed countries about the need to integrate the economies of developing countries into the global economy and encourage developing countries to adopt liberal trading policies, thus complementing and strengthening the multilateral trading system. She said this was an important issue and should be maintained on the future agenda of the CTD.","WTCOMTDM4.pdf","Mexico, Peru, CTD, Morocco, Secretariat, Uruguay, WTO, CTD"

The representative of India said that credit should be given for autonomous liberalization measures, and that binding of such measures in the WTO should not be a pre-requisite. If a country did bind its measures in the WTO, the legitimacy of its claim to be granted credit could not be questioned. While his delegation fully supported the concept, he was not in a position at this stage to suggest any mechanism for implementing it. He noted that paragraph 13 of the background document listed certain problems which could not be resolved at earlier meetings of the CTD. As no consensus was in sight, he agreed with Members that the issue should remain on the agenda of the CTD. He highlighted that the importance of the issue had also been recognized in the General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS).","WTCOMTDM4.pdf","India, WTO, WTO, CTD, Members, CTD, General, Agreement, on, Trade, in, Services"

A great deal of technical work on the subject had been carried out and the time had come to try and spell out certain ideas specifically. He said the Secretariat could assist by redistributing an informal paper submitted during the Uruguay Round by a number of Members, including Mexico, Egypt and Morocco. The Secretariat could also prepare WT/COMTD/M/4 Page 4 for the next meeting of the CTD a detailed document setting out the dimensions of the subject, and outlining options open to Members.","WTCOMTDM4.pdf","Morocco, Mexico, CTD, Secretariat, Uruguay, Members, Mexico, Egypt, Morocco, Secretariat, CTD, Members"
"3978",3978,"10","10.      He then pointed out that structural weaknesses in economies prevented LLDCs from taking advantage, in the short- and medium-term, of the opportunities to attract investment and expand exports. Among the grave problems facing LLDCs was the huge debt problem. In 1993, the external debt of African LLDCs stood at $96.7 billion and the ratio of total debt to GNP was 130 per cent. In nominal terms, the ratio of total debt to export of goods and services worsened from 389 per cent in 1985 to 565 per cent in 1993. The debt burden constrained the ability of LLDCs to invest in newer technologies to increase the production of goods and services for export. Instead of using their export earnings to strengthen supply capacities, earnings went into servicing their debts, perpetuating the cycle of poverty. Effective action at the multilateral level along the lines proposed by the World Bank to ease the debt burden on African and other poorer countries was needed; otherwise, African countries could not participate effectively in the multilateral trading system. A collective effort by the WTO, the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the World Bank and other intergovernmental economic institutions such as the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) and the International Trade Centre (ITC) would yield results. The Bretton Woods Institutions could be encouraged to significantly reduce the debt burden of African and other poorer countries, and to offer loans on concessional terms. Such measures would help LLDCs to adjust quickly to the short-term negative effects of the Uruguay Round, re-structure their economies, increase their exports and participate effectively in the multilateral trading system. Uruguay Round tariff cuts on products of export interest to LLDCs were below the global averages, and there was need for serious efforts by the international trading community to eliminate the barriers facing LLDC trade. He went on to enumerate measures that could be taken by the international trading community and by the WTO, UNCTAD and ITC to increase the trading opportunities of LLDCs. Product coverage and margins of preferences under GSP schemes should be improved. Preferences should be extended to semi-processed and processed agricultural products, natural resource-based products, fish and fish products, leather and footwear, textile and clothing. He encouraged countries who did not give preferential treatment to extend such treatment to the exports of LLDCs. The assistance of the WTO and other intergovernmental institutions was needed to develop and strengthen nascent service industries, especially in the increasingly important areas of financial services, transport and telecommunications. He asked that LLDC exports be exempted from any contingent protection measures, such as anti-dumping duties, countervailing duties and safeguard measures; and that major trading partners refrain from using measures such as environmental and labour regulations to restrict LLDC exports. Integrating LLDCs into the global economy called for painstaking sacrifices from them, and for ingenuity and foresight from trading partners and intergovernmental institutions such as the WTO, IMF, the World Bank, UNCTAD, ITC and FAO. Policy reforms undertaken by almost every least-developed country were clear evidence of their commitment to an open multilateral trading system.","WTCOMTDM4.pdf","LLDCs, LLDCs, World, Bank, WTO, International, Monetary, Fund, IMF, World, Bank, United, Nations, Conference, on, Trade, and, Development, UNCTAD, International, Trade, Centre, ITC, Uruguay, Round, Uruguay, Round, LLDCs, WTO, UNCTAD, ITC, LLDCs, GSP, WTO, WTO, IMF, World, Bank, UNCTAD, ITC, FAO"

"3956",3956,"49","49.     Deputy-Director General, Mr. Andrew Stoler said that a copy of the remarks he had made today was available in the room. There had been a question about whether or not the refinement of costs had affected the quality of the programmes. He did not believe it had. What had happened since the 14th of February was that there had been a downward revision of certain costs by about CHF 200,000 and an upward revision in cost-sharing of about CHF 225,000 francs. The cost-sharing arrangements had ensured savings to particular types of technical cooperation, for example in the rules area. Keeping that in mind and considering the question raised of what would happen if the cost-sharing arrangements did not come through, he said that first, the assumptions made with respect to cost-sharing were based on WTO's past experience with these agencies. Second, it had to be remembered that, in addition to the funds raised through the Pledging Conference, the Doha WT/COMTD/M/39 Page 14 Development Agenda Global Trust Fund also had an associated one million franc Buffer Fund designed to cover any temporary shortfalls that might occur, including because of some of the cost- sharing arrangements not working out as quickly as expected. Thirdly, while the General Council had set the overall level of the Doha Development Global Trust Fund for 2002 at CHF 15 million and although he had said that the estimate of the amount the Secretariat wished to receive was CHF 15.8 million, it was certainly hoped that donors would exceed that level of funding when they came to the Pledging Conference. However, no particular problems were expected in the area of cost-sharing. Finally, it had been asked whether or not there were any provisions for multiyear funding. The Doha Development Agenda Global Trust Fund was an annual fund. Targets were determined annually and it was to be operated annually. However, nothing in the rules of the fund prevented Members from making multiyear contributions.","WTCOMTDM39.pdf","Andrew, Stoler, WTO, Doha, Development, Agenda, Global, Trust, Fund, General, Council, Secretariat, Doha, Development, Agenda, Global, Trust, Fund, Members"
"3955",3955,"48","48.      He continued by welcoming the offer made by the delegation of the United States and the similar offer made by the representative of Japan, to host technical assistance activities in Geneva for which they would request support from the WTO Secretariat. He confirmed that the Secretariat would be in a position to support Members who wished to host technical assistance activities complementary to the Plan. He then referred to the requests made for more information on the proposed technical assistance database. A database would be created and managed by the WTO, but with assistance by both agency and country providers of technical assistance. The idea of creating a database had also received strong support from all the agencies at the level of Heads of Agency at the last IF meeting. That could be seen in paragraph 10 of the Final Communiqué of the Integrated Framework of Heads of Agency Meeting. The database would contain a listing of all beneficiaries, a list of the agencies as well as country providers of trade-related technical assistance. The agencies and country providers would feed details of their activities into the data-base, on the basis of agreed trade-related technical assistance categories. It would increase coherence and improve coordination, minimize duplication and hopefully lead to a more even distribution of the delivery of technical assistance to countries. He said that the LDCs continued to be the priority focus of WTO technical assistance as were the small economies and the non-residents. The Plan should, in that respect, be read in conjunction with a communiqué that had been circulated as part of the documentation for the meeting. In addition, the LDCs would benefit from national activities in their countries as well as from training activities in the WTO; from the Trade-Policy Reviews; and from regional seminars.","WTCOMTDM39.pdf","United, States, Japan, Geneva, WTO, Secretariat, Secretariat, Members, WTO, Heads, of, Agency, Integrated, Framework, of, Heads, of, Agency, Meeting, LDCs, WTO, LDCs, WTO"
"3954",3954,"47","47.      Mr Osakwe, Director, Technical Cooperation Division said that he welcomed and deeply encouraged the comments, criticisms and questions to the Secretariat which would all help in further improving the perfection of the Plan. The implementation of the Plan would also be guided by the comments, questions, clarifications and the suggestions that had been made. The Plan was currently undergoing evaluation and the Secretariat would be reporting to CTD, at an appropriate moment, on the results of the evaluation which had been undertaken by independent evaluators. He confirmed that the JITAP was an important and successful programme on which a report would follow. He said that there were several requests for clarification regarding the last sentence of paragraph 7 of the document WT/COMTD/W/95/Rev.2. That sentence referred to ad hoc requests and the need to keep them to a minimum. There was no inconsistency between ad hoc requests and flexibility. That last sentence should therefore be read in the context of the overall setting of paragraph 7. The purpose of                                                                                    WT/COMTD/M/39                                                                                           Page 13 paragraph 7 was to state that there would be both flexibility and dynamism in the Plan. The last sentence referred to that. He said that within the overall context of flexibly in the implementation of the Plan, and accommodating the needs of the beneficiaries, there would minimal disposition to requests of an ad hoc nature. This was not intended requests that involved either the submission of new or resubmission of technical assistance needs. Ad hoc requests were strictly defined as those activities that were submitted on the spur of the moment and which at times gave rise to conflicts between the authorities in the capitals and their Geneva based missions. This created innumerable challenges and problems for the Secretariat. He said that the Plan would be implemented in a flexible manner. He recalled that CARICOM had been quoted as an example at the last meeting. They had already submitted new requests on the basis of which the Secretariat had substituted some of the old activities by new ones in the current Plan. Such changes were possible and did not fall into the category of ad hoc requests. The importance of evaluation during the course of the implementation of the Plan had been mentioned. He said that this was a good point as it would ensure that evaluation was not back loaded at the end of the year. An independent technical cooperation audit had been established within the Secretariat, but independent of the Technical Cooperation Division and all other divisions. There had been some specific questions regarding the details of the Plan. Based on the suggestion from the Chairman, he proposed to take up these individually with the concerned delegations. There had been several requests by delegations to host regional activities in the areas where it had been indicated that the venue was ""to be confirmed"". Such requests were welcome and would be put to all the countries in the regions concerned. The determination of venues for regional activities was not a determination that the WTO Secretariat could make on its own. This selection was based on consultations with countries in the regions and with the regional organizations involved.","WTCOMTDM39.pdf","Osakwe, Director, Technical, Cooperation, Division, Secretariat, Secretariat, CTD, Geneva, Secretariat, CARICOM, Secretariat, Secretariat, Technical, Cooperation, Division, Chairman, WTO, Secretariat"
"3953",3953,"46","46.     The representative of the European Communities said that the Committee should endorse the Plan. Even though, concerns had been raised that this would mean the Committee was being forced to have an unflexible Plan, there was an easy way out, and that was to ask the Secretariat to start implementing the Plan. Many delegations had accepted that the Plan was flexible and that the Committee would not be bound to every letter of it. It was clear that it was work in progress, and that the Committee should accept and advise the Secretariat to implement it on such an understanding. That was would be enough of an endorsement. Just taking note would also set a precedent which his delegation would not be able to accept.","WTCOMTDM39.pdf","European, Communities, Committee, Committee, Secretariat, Committee, Committee, Secretariat"

He said that Deputy Director-General Ravier had said in the beginning that it was an ongoing process. However, if the Plan was adopted, it would be difficult to incorporate changes in it. The intention was therefore to take note of the Plan and to work on it as its implementation proceeded.","WTCOMTDM39.pdf","Chairman, Director-General, Ravier"
"3951",3951,"44","44.     The representative of China sought a clarification on the status of the Plan since many delegations had said that they were ready to adopt the Plan.

His understanding was that the Committee should take note of it, since its adoption could create problems for some delegations and set a precedent for the future, which was not desirable.","WTCOMTDM39.pdf","China, Committee"
"3950",3950,"43","43.      The representative of Nigeria requested the Secretariat to take account of the relevant comments that had been made, especially on the need for flexibility, close coordination with beneficiaries and evaluation. However, what was most important was the effectiveness of the technical assistance provided and the resulting improvement in the situation of the beneficiaries. He also said that his delegation was ready to adopt the Plan.","WTCOMTDM39.pdf","Nigeria, Secretariat"
"3949",3949,"42","42.     The representative of Switzerland said that the new draft was an improvement over the old version. His delegation was particularly appreciative of the synthesis and more compact presentation, achieved by subdividing the activities according to topics. Evaluation or assessment should not only be carried out at the end of the year in the form of the report which was to be made to the General Council under the heading of Capacity-Building. He welcomed the statements made by the representatives of Venezuela and Argentina who had suggested that evaluation should be carried out WT/COMTD/M/39 Page 12 as the Plan was implemented. It was important to improve the Plan as it was implemented to refine activities when either gaps or deficiencies were noticed. That would ensure the most efficient use of the resources available. Evaluation also implied transparency and his delegation wished to stress that transparency, which was currently apparent when reading the Plan, be also ensured with regard to future requests from Governments, including feedback from those Governments which had already benefited from certain programme activities. That would give delegations a clearer picture of what was being requested and how those requests would be followed up in the course of the year. He called for the inclusion of an item involving the JITAP. The JITAP was a pioneer exercise in the overall framework of coordination, in this case between three organizations active in the area of technical assistance. Even though it was not clear what the follow-up would be, positive lessons could already be drawn. His delegation welcomed the increased effort of coordinating technical assistance activities since the Doha Ministerial Conference, with other organizations like UNCTAD, including the emphasis sought to be given to investment. That coordination should also be attempted in other areas where UNCTAD had an announced programme of activities, such as in the area of trade facilitation for example and electronic commerce.","WTCOMTDM39.pdf","Switzerland, General, Council, Venezuela, Argentina, UNCTAD, UNCTAD"
"3948",3948,"41","41.      The representative of Morocco said that the revised Plan was clearer, particularly since the technical assistance aspect had been greatly strengthened since the Doha Ministerial Conference. The technical cooperation activities were an important aspect of WTO’s work, particularly to help the developing countries and LDCs better understand the mechanisms and rules of the Organization and thus enable them to apply them appropriately. The technical assistance already provided, although fairly satisfactory, was nonetheless insufficient since the technical assistance needs of the developing and LDCs countries had increased as a result of the multiplicity of new areas now being covered by the WTO. The creation of new working groups provided an example of that new growth. His delegation therefore believed that any annual technical assistance programme should be somewhat flexibile in order to accommodate those new aspects. His delegation attached importance to the implementation which should be considerably strengthened, particularly in the area of negotiating techniques. His Government was pleased to be the host of an upcoming regional seminar for French- speaking African countries which was being organized to enable developing countries to take important decisions after the Fifth Ministerial Conference. The role played by UNCTAD was essential since that Organization had an undeniable comparative advantage on the Singapore issues which would be dealt with during the seminar. The work in the WTO included new issues such as environment, electronic commerce and different technology-related issues. New ground had to be broken as the WTO technical assistance programme could no longer be limited to the classic organization of seminars and workshops. Certain criteria, such as for example the multiplying effect of training activities should be strengthened. His delegation therefore reiterated, in a purely explorative manner, a suggestion for organizing with the Moroccan University, a whole round of new studies which could have benefit many countries in the African region. Such an activity would be in line with the training activities undertaken by WTO and would be beneficial, since those receiving a diploma as a result of such studies would be able to handle WTO issues both in the Government as well as in the private sector.","WTCOMTDM39.pdf","Morocco, Doha, Ministerial, Conference, WTO, LDCs, WTO, UNCTAD, Singapore, WTO, WTO, Moroccan, University, WTO, WTO"
"3947",3947,"40","40.      The representative of Haiti said that he was pleased to see the prominent place given to the LDCs in the Plan. The Plan was possibly the one WTO document which had been the object of the greatest amount of consultations with a view to taking Members' concerns into account. That transparency was reflected in the Plan. The document was not only discussed in the CTD, its financing had been pushed in the Committee on Budget, Finance and Administration. His delegation appreciated the importance attached to its evaluation. A unit had been established to carry out the evaluation and assist the Committee in that respect. That would guarantee those concerned that all activities would be implemented. Members should trust that the proposed audit would evaluate and conceivably fine-tune the Plan, that should now be adopted in order for its implementation to begin, even though it could be subject to further improvement during its implementation. He said that it should be implemented with both rigour and flexibility. Deputy Director-General Stoler had indirectly invited delegations to take the financing dimension into account. The Pledging Conference would present an opportunity for his Governments' development partners, who had been most generous, to realize that the CHF 15 million requested earlier would perhaps not suffice and that additional funds may be required. The Plan was quite balanced and should be adopted for its implementation to proceed, an implementation which was really ongoing as two missions had already been undertaken to Haiti.","WTCOMTDM39.pdf","Haiti, WTO, Members, CTD, Committee, on, Budget, ,, Finance, and, Administration, Committee, Members, Director-General, Stoler, Haiti"

"3945",3945,"39","39.     The representative of India said that the representative of Senegal had mentioned the importance of conducting some studies. The Doha Ministerial Mandate was an ambitious Programme and there were many issues that had to be analysed and understood in the upcoming months. It was therefore important that provisional studies be made in the CTD. Apart from that small point, his delegation did not have any particular problem with the document. Many delegations had mentioned the importance of flexibility as beneficiaries might have additional or changing requests as the                                                                                    WT/COMTD/M/39                                                                                           Page 11 implementation proceeded.

"3944",3944,"38","38.      The representative of China said that he hoped that the Secretariat would take the comments made by delegations regarding the implementation of the Plan into account. His delegation agreed that during the implementation of the Plan there should be enough flexibility for delegations to make changes. Some delegations might need to request more changes than others as had been heard. There might even be fluctuations in delegations' priorities for technical cooperation activities and that should be allowed within the limit of the Secretariat's resources. However, his delegation did not believe that it was a good idea for the Committee to continue to debate the Plan. Its implementation had to start and additional improvements could be made during its implementation. His delegation also had some editorial issues which he would raise with the Secretariat later. Other delegations could also do the same so that the discussions could now stop and the implementation commence. Delegations would also have the opportunity during the stock-taking process or in the middle of the implementation period to come up with further suggestions and proposals for improvements of the Plan.","WTCOMTDM39.pdf","China, Secretariat, Secretariat, Committee, Secretariat"

However, it had taken into account the needs expressed and arranged them into a consistent programme. His delegation was pleased to find that the document had taken into account concerns his delegation had raised. His Government was experiencing a difficult period and its priorities might fluctuate. It might therefore need to take advantage of the flexibility contained in the document to change priorities. Other speakers had said that the implementation of the Plan would be the challenge. However, with his knowledge of the Secretariat he was certain that the implementation would be satisfactory.","WTCOMTDM39.pdf","Côte, d'Ivoire, Committee, Secretariat"

The representative of the United States said that her delegation supported the Committee taking note of the Plan at the meeting, as a living document that would take into account the concerns and needs of the beneficiary Members as its implementation proceeded. The suggestion made by the representative of Argentina concerning a stock-taking type of approach would be useful. Her delegation supported continuing work on developing partnerships with other institutions that could participate in the programmes outlined and any other programmes that would evolve. She reiterated the suggestion that her delegation had made in the last CTD meeting, that the CTD Chairman should consult with the Chairpersons of other WTO bodies with technical assistance mandates, to enable the CTD to take-stock of what was going on in the other bodies with respect to technical assistance.","WTCOMTDM39.pdf","United, States, Committee, Members, Argentina, CTD, Chairman, WTO, CTD"
"3939",3939,"33","33.      The representative of Argentina said that, in connection with the revision of the Plan, he had some questions for the Secretariat. First, as there had been certain changes, he asked if there had been elimination of, or modification to some of the activities proposed in the earlier versions, particularly of those in Latin American countries. Second, he asked if there was, as a result of carrying out more activities with less resources, had been any qualitative modification in activities, especially with respect to the regional seminars and if there had been a reduction in the logistic backup in terms of the number of invited participants to regional seminars. Turning to general comments on technical assistance, he said that on evaluation of the implementation of the Plan would be important. It might therefore be worthwhile, as the end of the first quarter of the year was approaching, to have the Secretariat draw up an evaluation of already-implemented activities. Such a factual evaluation would permit delegations to identify any problems that might have occurred, with a view to improving the situation. He said that he did not have any further information regarding the trade and environment seminar for the Latin American region which should have been held in Colombia and which had been mentioned by the representative of Venezuela. If it had not been productive and had not yield the desired results, there would unfortunately still not be any other seminar throughout the year. There were two other activities in the field of trade and environment, but they related to specific environment protocols. The seminar to which he had referred to was one on trade and environment in general, covering a wide range of subjects in the field. Lastly, with respect to implementation, he suggested that the document which presented the activities on an item-by-item or subject-by-subject basis should at the end, have a list of activities by date, including the subject, for delegations to get a clear picture and an overview of how the implementation had advanced.

The representative of Paraguay said that, as it already was the end of the first quarter of 2002, and as the discussion on technical assistance and capacity-building would also continue to be discussed in different WTO bodies, the Plan should be approved. Delegations could then dedicate themselves to discuss procedures in order to fine-tune the Plan and to ensure the appropriate follow- up and evaluation.","WTCOMTDM39.pdf","Paraguay, WTO"
"3937",3937,"31","31.      The representative of Mauritania said that the importance attached to technical assistance had to be enhanced as it was an instrument to enable the developing countries, and LDCs in particular, to better integrate to in the multilateral trading system. He welcomed the efforts made over the last few years and which had made it possible for his Government to benefit from technical assistance and to make progress. His delegation believed that the interdependence between the Plan and the IF had not been sufficiently highlighted. During the diagnostic studies which had been undertaken in pilot countries, his being one of them, precise needs had been flagged, in terms of technical assistance and those were reflected in the matrix. He believed that it would be useful to see to what degree the technical assistance requirements reflected in the matrix could be better taken into consideration in the actual programme. He said that it might be difficult to take them all into consideration, but as far as his country was concerned, they believed that the strengthening of trade negotiating capacities in the area of services and agriculture and the establishment of new schedules of concessions and for example the implementation of notification requirements were all areas which should be taken into consideration in the programme. As had already been said in the Heads of Agencies Communiqué, his delegation believed that the time had come to consider a different approach to draw up projects which could be presented to donors. His Government was in fact preparing a project which would be submitted to the Standing Committee of the IF at its meeting on 8 March 2002. Those projects took into consideration the priority requirements which had been identified in the course of the diagnostic service that would be available and distributed to all partners that showed an interest in the area.","WTCOMTDM39.pdf","Mauritania, LDCs, Standing, Committee"

His delegation was aware that the document was not perfect and in that respect appreciated that the Secretariat had confirmed that the document was work in progress. His delegation was prepared to contribute in that regard. He said his Government sought the possibility of hosting seminars in Geneva with the cooperation of WTO in the field of the Singapore issues. He said that though the document was important, the implementation of it was even more so. There could be a change of priority in the coming month and therefore his delegation believed that it would be important to review, from time to time, the                                                                                       WT/COMTD/M/39                                                                                               Page 9 capacity-building activities undertaken on the basis of the Plan.

His delegation asked for clarification on the concept of reciprocity. He asked what it actually entailed. He said that the observations made on the previous Plan by his delegation had not been addressed. He noted that an LDC focus was clearly missing and associated himself with the comments made by the LDC coordinator. It was his delegations hope that the Plan would provide a heightened visibility for LDCs in order for their concerns to be taken on board and be clearly reflected in the Plan.","WTCOMTDM39.pdf","Zambia, LDC"

The representative of Canada said that her delegation was pleased to note that the Plan was work in progress and looked forward to the inclusion of the JITAP programme as an important instrument of the technical assistance and capacity building as had been noted by other delegations. As the present donor coordinator for the JITAP programme, she said her delegation was pleased to announce that the donors would be favourably disposed to using some of the funding to create toolkits which would be of great use to the beneficiaries. That process had already began under the JITAP programme. Her delegation noted that the evaluation which was presently under way was going to look at the lessons learned and best practices of the programme as a point of assistance to other countries. She hoped that the IF, to which her Government was a major donor, would use the diagnostic tools that had been used by the World Bank and others in the process. That would speed up the process of allowing beneficiaries to make full use of all the mechanisms which had been recently made available. In that regard, her delegation supported the EC statement that, by working together throughout the year, the process of considering the technical assistance Plan would be strengthened for 2003. She highlighted paragraph 11 which dealt with monitoring and review, saying that that would help Members learn from what had been done and what could be done to ensure that the best instruments were used, so as to ensure the best use of the resources available for the Plan.","WTCOMTDM39.pdf","Canada, World, Bank, EC, Members"

The representative of Barbados said that her delegation welcomed the Chairman's initial comments that the Plan was flexible and like others noted that it was work in progress.

"3931",3931,"26","26.     The representative of Senegal said that his delegation subscribed to everything that has been said by the representative of Uganda on behalf of the LDCs. His country believed that the main points of the activities that his delegation had requested for had been reflected in the Plan. His delegation saw that there was considerable improvement in the revision of the Plan with regards the ease of reading the document, on the approach according to the different topics included and also by including to the different principles underlying the document. For instance, the flexibility highlighted in paragraph 7, was a highly important aspect which would certainly be required. The activities which had been reflected in the document stemmed from the technical assistance programme which had been elaborated in 2001 and with time there may be certain activities that may have to be WT/COMTD/M/39 Page 8 modified or even amended and other activities included. There were many elements in the document which his delegation welcomed, for example the creation of a database which would be another step towards a greater coherence in technical assistance activities. He asked for information on that idea and said that the developing countries should be helped in ensuring access to the database, once the operational stage of the database was reached. With regard to the costing of the Plan, he said that his delegations concerns were justified since it saw that the estimates had gone beyond the CHF 15 million target that set. He hoped that that would be taken into consideration at the Pledging Conference. The Doha Development Agenda, which was in addition to the normal activities of the WTO, would quite naturally require a lot of funds. Members would be needing the support of the Development and Economic Research Division for studies to be carried out in specific areas so that Members had the necessary information to enable them to negotiate correctly. He concluded by asking to what degree the patent for technical assistance which had been established under such areas as customs valuation, technical barriers to trade had been taken into consideration in the overall programme.","WTCOMTDM39.pdf","Senegal, Uganda, LDCs, Doha, Development, Agenda, WTO, Members, Development, and, Economic, Research, Division, Members"
"3930",3930,"25","25.       The representative of Venezuela said that her delegation had always understood that the Plan was not to be adopted, but rather that Members would make comments which would bring the Plan up to the level of its objectives which was primarily the strengthening of the national capacity of the countries involved. She agreed with other delegations that the implementation of the Plan could be improved upon and that it should be done. In order to improve it, the activities had to be determined in close coordination with the recipient countries. Experiences should be taken into consideration in order to optimise the programmes so as to ensure the appropriate follow-up. She gave the example of a regional seminar on environment held in Latin America, the organization of which she said had been far from ideal. The travel tickets had been made available to participants only about a day before their proposed departure. The seminar had been convened rather hastily, and her Government had very little time to nominate the participants. It was essential that there should be better coordination between the recipients, the donors and the WTO including on when that type of technical cooperation was being provided. She hoped that such difficulties would be overcome in the future and that the experience would be used to improve future activities. With regard to the capacity-building programme she said that her delegation continued to believe that coordination with UNCTAD could be strengthened. She expressed her gratitude on the information provided on the budgetary aspect and the funding for the implementation of the Plan and said that some delegations felt that the idea was not to do more with less, but that the philosophy should be to do more and better, with more.","WTCOMTDM39.pdf","Venezuela, Members, Latin, America, WTO, UNCTAD"
"3929",3929,"24","24.     He went on to say that his delegation wished the Plan established clear objectives with targets to be achieved that would form the basis upon which the envisaged evaluation and auditing could take place. In doing so it should be taken into account whether the short seminars were effective in the building of capacity and of any other goals set. He emphasized that the Doha Ministerial Declaration recognized LDCs as the group of countries with the most acute technical assistance and capacity- building needs. That should be reflected in the operative part of the Plan through the balancing of issues covered and through balanced geographical distribution. The Plan was being administered separately under a fund and presently only covered three out of the forty-nine LDCs. He took note of the joint statement by the Heads of Agencies for the meeting in Washington and though it was supposed to deal with the IF, it had dealt with a wider field and there had even been consideration of extending the IF. The IF had to first be effective and extended to all the LDCs. Its extension should not have negative consequences on the LDCs. He concluded by saying that his delegation was willing to take note of the Plan and hoped that it would be revised according to the comments made. He noted that there was only one activity specifically for Uganda by WIPO.","WTCOMTDM39.pdf","Heads, of, Agencies, Washington, Uganda, WIPO"
"3928",3928,"23","23.      The representative of Uganda said that he was speaking on behalf of the LDCs. He stressed that the LDCs Ministers had been apprehensive when the Doha Agenda had been expanded as the LDCs lacked capacity. The Doha Agenda was going to stretch their capacities to the maximum. The situation was likely to become particularly complex in the near future, hence the need for prioritised capacity-building for the LDCs, which had been stressed in the introduction to the Plan. He agreed with the representative of the European Communities that such a priority should also have been well reflected in the operation of the activities. The LDCs did not believe that their priority was adequately reflected, but noted that the Plan was work in progress. With regard to paragraph 7, he was unsure how the Secretariat would accommodate additional requests when revisions were said to be tightly controlled and flexible at the same time. Some of the needs of the Members were being assumed and there had to be a mechanism for addressing those needs. With regard to the LDC needs being mostly dealt within the context of the IF, he said that looking at the activities for the LDCs, there were mostly for the pilot countries. It was therefore not clear how issues specific to LDCs not part of the pilot countries would be dealt with outside the IF. That was an issue had to be drawn to the                                                                                    WT/COMTD/M/39                                                                                            Page 7 attention of the Secretariat and he hoped that, in the costing of the programme, imaginative solutions could be found. He agreed with the representative of Kenya and Egypt with regard to JITAP. The LDCs, as consumers of technical assistance, had benefited from JITAP. In Uganda, the public sector, private sector and civil society had all found it to be one of the most effective mechanisms of building capacity. He urged that its extension be agreed and that it be included in the Plan. He said the LDCs welcomed the efforts to create synergies with the other agencies such as WIPO, FAO and UNCTAD. However, there had to be more emphasis on market access. There was an imbalance with the focus being on only some of the issues. Technical assistance and capacity building was part and parcel of the Doha Work Programme and affected other parts of the programme as well.","WTCOMTDM39.pdf","Uganda, LDCs, Doha, Agenda, LDCs, LDCs, Secretariat, Members, LDC, Secretariat, Kenya, Egypt, JITAP, Uganda, LDCs, WIPO, FAO, UNCTAD, Doha, Work, Programme"

The representative of Belize said that although Deputy Director-General Ravier had indicated that the Plan might not be perfect it did not mean that the implementation could not be near perfect. He was confident that the Secretariat would do its best to ensure that the objectives were met. The sense of the Secretariat being overwhelmed derived from what had now become an expanded programme. That would give insight into the challenges faced by small economies and missions in Geneva. His delegation welcomed the establishment of strategic partnerships and/or strengthening of any previously existing ones and said he hoped that this would facilitate the creation of more direct links between technical assistance and capacity-building programmes as part of the Doha Development Agenda. Such partnerships should not be short term, but should become sustainable as the needs for technical assistance and capacity-building would always remain. The Secretariat Plan had facilitated structuring and restructuring of the national plans for technical assistance and capacity- building as it had allowed delegations to match any programme offers with their identified needs. He asked if any assurances had been made from any of the intended cost-sharing partners and to what extent the Plan had adopted the successes from earlier technical assistance Plans delivered by the Secretariat. In particular, he mentioned the IF, as he was aware that it had been a success and that there had been some changes in it, that might be good to take note of or even incorporate in the Plan. He concluded by asking whether any indication or pledges for funding for subsequent years had been secured and whether such discussions were part of the ongoing negotiations or if the approach of the Secretariat was to pursue them on a year-to-year basis rather than over a longer period.","WTCOMTDM39.pdf","Belize, Director-General, Ravier, Secretariat, Secretariat, Geneva, Doha, Development, Agenda, Secretariat, Secretariat, Secretariat"
"3926",3926,"21","21.      The representative of Kenya noted that Members had perhaps not yet fully absorbed the realities of what was specifically needed for the implementation of the Doha Development Agenda. He was pleased that the Secretariat had noted that. The Plan was work in progress and his delegation noted that its execution would be combined with flexibility and that its implementation would give Members the possibility to prioritise what they wished. That was where timing became crucial. His Government was considering the Plan and what activities had been allocated to it. His Government would rather start with the activity on page 52, a seminar on trade policy, capacity-building and research, as that was their priority and one that tied well with the Doha Development Agenda. He hoped a date for the that activity would be communicated soon. He went on to say that being a beneficiary of the JITAP had been a success story for his country as its benefits had been clearly visible. He agreed that it should command the same priority, if not more than the IF. He said that the Secretariat Plan gave prominence to the IF which he understood to still be in the pilot stage. However, the JITAP had been a success and it should be continued. It was mentioned in the Doha Ministerial Declaration and it would therefore be appropriate if it could also figure in the Plan so as to make it more balanced. He welcomed the proposed increase in the number of activities. However, the timing and the level of the technical assistance would also be very important. His Government wished to receive this capacity-building and technical assistance before the commencement of the negotiations on the subjects mentioned in the Doha Ministerial Declaration.","WTCOMTDM39.pdf","Kenya, Members, Doha, Development, Agenda, Secretariat, Members, Doha, Development, Agenda, Secretariat"

There should be more coordination in the delivery of technical assistance among all international organizations. The layout of the document was helpful because it focussed on specific countries and areas. Another merit of the document was that it was demand driven which meant that possible donors could be assured of the needs of developing countries. She was pleased that the Plan was work in progress and asked how a Member should go about submitting or resubmitting requests. Her delegation had some previous requests which could not be implemented due to budgetary constraints. Those requests were not reflected in the revised Plan. Accordingly, she called the attention of the Secretariat to the previously requested technical assistance.

However, he urged the Secretariat to start consultations with Members early for 2003 in order to have a smoother debate then. It was important to better identify needs and to have a better approach to cooperation with other organizations. He acknowledged that there had been a shortage of time for such an approach in 2002. However, Members still needed a solid basis to continue their work. He concluded by saying that, in terms of costing, he was pleased that more work was being proposed to be done in the Plan with less money.","WTCOMTDM39.pdf","Secretariat, Members, Members"
"3922",3922,"18","18.      The representative of the European Communities began by reminding the Committee of how, at the last meeting, his delegation had been critical of the Plan and had expressed difficulty endorsing it. However, he was pleased that an fair amount of work had been devoted into the restructuring of the document and many of their points had been taken into account. He however said that they would continue to look for issues that they thought were not fully addressed, for instance, the focus on Africa and the focus on LDCs could be strengthened, the financing could be made clearer and the focus on negotiating could also be clearer. It was also important to point out the revised paragraph 2(i) where Members had a clear commitment to work further on the strategic partnerships. Much of the work in that connection was work in progress, but the large amount of activities which was now included, in particular with UNCTAD on investment and competition policy showed that it went in the right direction. He also hoped to see progress on trade facilitation. He said that the his delegation was pleased with paragraph 5 where it was made clear that any activity undertaken had to answer the basic question as how it was related to the Doha Ministerial Mandate. Those who executed the planned workshops would have to look for specific requests related to Doha Commitments and that the work in progress also meant that those activities would need to be structured differently from what they had been in the past.","WTCOMTDM39.pdf","Committee, Africa, Members, UNCTAD"

In respect to that, he said that his delegation wished to reinforce and reiterate the idea that JITAP should be part of the Plan as expressly mentioned in paragraph 39 of the Doha Ministerial Declaration. He said that the JITAP had been a successful programme that had benefited many developing countries and further coherence with that programme would be useful. As a number of activities under the Plan still were to be confirmed, he expressed his delegation's interest in hosting one of the activities in the competition policy area mentioned on page 15 of the Plan. The intensive training course mentioned at the top of the page would be a useful addition to their programme. He commented on Deputy Director-General Stoler's concern as to the possibility, however remote, that other parties to the programme might not contribute the expected financial resources on time, and asked whether the Secretariat could in any way ensure that this eventuality did not become a reality.","WTCOMTDM39.pdf","Egypt, Director-General, Stoler, Secretariat"

His delegation had requested technical assistance in respect of the TRIPS Agreement and Competition Law and Policy and trade negotiating skills. It had received a response from the Secretariat indicating that the needs would be accommodated in the Plan, but now he saw the regional agreements against the name of his country on page 23 of the Plan. He asked whether it was under the indicated regional activity that his delegation's request would be accommodated. He also                                                                                     WT/COMTD/M/39                                                                                             Page 5 asked whether on the WTO Agreements his country would be expected to indicate the specific activities that they wished to be carried out under the regional agreements.","WTCOMTDM39.pdf","Ghana, Secretariat, WTO"

"3918",3918,"14","14.      He went on to say that there were various assumptions made on the basis of past experience with respect to potential cost-sharing arrangements. Those cost-sharing arrangement assumptions differed according to partners and according to activities. In most cases, the Secretariat had been conservative in their estimate of cost sharing. However, it was true that in some cases they had not been able to determine the final capacity of their partners to deliver on the expected cost-sharing arrangements. That would be important, for example, in the case of joint activities planned with UNCTAD with respect to investment and competition where UNCTAD had been expected to share in the programme costs on the basis of fifty-fifty participation. All the figures he had given therefore assumed that on those important projects there would be a fifty-fifty cost-sharing participation. He said that if that assumption turned out to be incorrect it would affect the overall costing from the WTO standpoint. He concluded by saying that he believed that now Members had before them fairly reliable figures that should give them confidence that WTO would be able to accomplish the planned activities within the forecasted levels of funding and he hoped that these details would help them be better prepared for the Pledging Conference.","WTCOMTDM39.pdf","Secretariat, UNCTAD, UNCTAD, WTO, Members, WTO"
"3917",3917,"13","13.      Deputy Director-General, Mr. Andrew Stoler said that once all the figures were consolidated the estimated costs for providing the planned technical assistance activities, including the related programme support funds, came to around CHF 22,5 million. Cost-sharing assumptions reduced that total by CHF 4.7 million, and when another CHF 1.5 million in costs to be borne by the regular budget of the WTO were deducted, the target for contributions to the Doha Development Agenda Global Trust Fund was around CHF 16.3 million. That figure was about CHF 1.3 million higher than the CHF 15 million target agreed to the General Council for the Doha Development Agenda Global Trust Fund for 2002. Since then further refinements had been made to the scope of the activities to be financed and the Secretariat had tried to refine the costing of the activities included in the Plan. The Annex previously attached to the Plan had been eliminated and additional technical cooperation projects had instead been incorporated in the Plan. Refining the approach to costing and changing certain assumptions with respect to cost-sharing arrangements had allowed the Secretariat to reduce the anticipated cost of the planned activities even, while expanding the scope of the work. That left a net amount of around CHF 15.8 million to be borne by the Doha Development Agenda Global Trust Fund on technical assistance activities which was about CHF 800,000 higher than the originally agreed target for the Doha Development Agenda Global Trust Fund. He said that arriving at those figures the Secretariat had used the same standard costing formula that he had referred to at the meeting.","WTCOMTDM39.pdf","Director-General, Andrew, Stoler, WTO, Doha, Development, Agenda, Global, Trust, Fund, General, Council, Doha, Development, Agenda, Global, Secretariat, Secretariat, Doha, Development, Agenda, Global, Trust, Fund, Doha, Development, Agenda, Global, Trust, Fund, Secretariat"
"3916",3916,"12","12.      He went on to inform the Committee about the results of some activities undertaken by the Secretariat in relation to technical assistance and capacity-building. First, agencies and country providers of trade-related technical assistance had met in Geneva on 19 February 2002. The purpose of that meeting had been to explore the basis of coordinated action by agencies and country providers of technical assistance for the creation and management of a trade-related technical assistance database. The group agreed to meet periodically to begin the creation and the management of the database. The next meeting would be held on 12 March in the WTO. Since the first meeting of the group, the Heads of the six core IF agencies had endorsed the proposal for the database. Second, the meeting of the IF Heads of Agency which had been convened by the Director-General in Washington on 26 February 2002 and hosted by Mr Jim Wolfensohn, President of the World Bank, had been a success. The Heads of Agency meeting had focused inter alia on the implementation of the IF pilot scheme and its extension. A joint communiqué of the Heads of Agency had fully endorsed the extension of the IF to other least-developed countries. Third, the JITAP was a successful programme involving three agencies: ITC, UNCTAD and the WTO. It was an integral part of the 2002 Technical Assistance Plan and was currently under evaluation. Fourth, as a first step in the process of establishing strategic alliances with regional institutions, the Director-General and the President of the Inter-American Development Bank had signed, on 27 February 2002, a memorandum of understanding under which the institutions would seek to deepen cooperation in order to provide technical assistance on trade negotiations and capacity-building to countries in Latin America and the Caribbean. Fifth, he said that the Committee had a tight and substantive programme before the Pledging Conference. He appealed to donor countries and invited agencies to ensure that the Pledging Conference became a success. A success which would maintain the post-Doha momentum on the central issue of technical cooperation. He went on to say that the Annual Plan could not respond to all the needs of the beneficiary countries. The Plan was only one of six basic elements in the overall architecture for responding to the Doha mandate on technical cooperation. Those elements included the interagency strategic partnerships; strategic partnerships with the bilateral donors; strategic WT/COMTD/M/39 Page 4 partnerships with regional banks, regional institutions and commissions; the IF for responding to the needs and priorities of the LDCs, the WTO trade-related database and the Secretariat Annual Plan for responding to the short-term needs focused on WTO Agreements, building knowledge on the Agreements, explaining obligations, identifying the rights and enhancing trade negotiation and policy capacity. He said he hoped that it would be possible for the Committee to take note of the Revision 2 of the Technical Assistance Plan and allow the Secretariat to accelerate the pace of its implementation.","WTCOMTDM39.pdf","Committee, Secretariat, Geneva, WTO, IF, Heads, of, Agency, Director-General, Washington, Jim, Wolfensohn, World, Bank, Heads, of, Agency, ITC, UNCTAD, WTO, Director-General, Inter-American, Development, Bank, Latin, America, Caribbean, Committee, Doha, WTO, Secretariat, WTO, Committee, Secretariat"
"3915",3915,"11","11.      He then went on to comment on the content of the Plan and stated that the revision dealt not only with the list of activities, but also with the structure of the Plan itself. The Plan had now been structured around themes, issues and mandates. The annexes on the Singapore issues and on trade and environment had been removed and specific activities on those issues had been included in the main list of activities. More direct and visible links had been established between the WTO’s trade- related technical assistance and capacity-building activities and the Doha Development Agenda. The number of activities had also increased to 514, an increase that had enabled the Secretariat to accommodate the new, expanded and more elaborated needs of the Membership. In response to Members' emphasis on coordination with other agencies he reported that all the activities under investment and competition had been coordinated and would be jointly delivered by the WTO and UNCTAD. Active discussions were under way with other organizations and would be reported continuously to the Committee. As far as the least-developed countries (LDCs) were concerned a meeting of the Integrated Framework (IF) Heads of Agency that took place in Washington had made a significant contribution towards improving coherence and coordination amongst the six core IF agencies. The final communiqué adopted at that meeting of the Heads of Agency was available and would be reported on fully at a later meeting by the Director-General. The donors, LDCs and the African Group had already been briefed on the results of the meeting. He emphasized that not only had priority been accorded to the needs of the LDCs, but the WTO had also enhanced its efforts with other core agencies to significantly improve interagency coordination and coherence. He said that in the several informal consultations carried out by the Secretariat with various groups, beneficiary Members had expressed satisfaction with the revision recognizing that while the Plan might not be perfect, the Secretariat's assurances of flexibility in its implementation responded to their concerns.","WTCOMTDM39.pdf","Singapore, WTO, Doha, Development, Agenda, Secretariat, Members, WTO, UNCTAD, Committee, Washington, Director-General, LDCs, African, Group, WTO, Secretariat, Members, Secretariat"

Deputy Director-General, Mr. Paul-Henri Ravier expressed his appreciation to Members for the opportunity to continue the dialogue on the Secretariat’s Technical Assistance Plan. The actual implementation of the Plan for 2002 had begun on 1 January 2002, and a little over 50 activities had been executed over the past two months. Operational activities were being implemented on the basis of the new strategy welcomed and endorsed by Ministers in paragraph 38 of the Doha Ministerial Declaration and on the basis of the clear mandate contained in the Doha Ministerial Declaration. Since implementation of the Plan began the Secretariat had been involved in exhaustive bilateral and plurilateral conversations with Members, both beneficiaries and providers of technical assistance. He assured Members that the Secretariat welcomed the advice that it was receiving. He said it was through the Members persistence that the necessary improvements had been made in the Plan. He emphasised that both the Plan and its implementation was work in progress. The Secretariat was still searching for the right approaches to respond to the new and unprecedented Development Agenda established at the Doha Ministerial Conference. It also meant that the Secretariat intended throughout the year and the implementation period, to meet the real needs of the beneficiaries and of the providers of the resources, in a flexible and dynamic manner. The Secretariat had continued                                                                                      WT/COMTD/M/39                                                                                              Page 3 consultations, in various formats, since the last CTD meeting in order to fine tune and focus the Plan more precisely around the substantive concerns that had been expressed by Members during the previous meetings.

The Advanced Internet is a project to establish an advanced network based on Internet protocols (IP), which aims to upgrade the national telecommunications system and integrate all voice, data and image services. The key objective is not only to increase high-bandwidth coverage in Costa Rica, but also to reduce the cost of Internet access for businesses, households and academic institutions. The project seeks to guarantee generalized access to the main communication networks and the exchange of data in order to help people in their daily lives – especially in rural areas – and drive the new economy forward.","WTCOMTDM38.pdf","Costa, Rica"

While in 1995 exports of high-technology products accounted for no more than 1.2 per cent of all goods exported from the country, the relative share of the sector had risen to almost 30 per cent by the year 2000. From 1998 on, the arrival in Costa Rica of major foreign-owned firms led to an exponential increase in foreign sales in branches with a strong technological component. From 1995 to 2001, exports in the technology sector grew by an average of around 130 per cent per year.

He said that the Director-General had accepted the invitation to the Conference and would be making an introductory statement at the plenary session at the summit component of the Conference. The DG would also be co-sharing one of the summit level round tables on the theme ""Financing for Development: Looking Ahead"". The heads of the institutional stakeholders namely the IMF (Mr Köhler), the World Bank (Mr Wolfensohn), and the WTO (Mr Moore) along with the Secretary-General of the United Nations (Mr Kofi Annan) had also been invited to participate in the Press Conference sometime during the summit segment of the Conference. In conclusion, he drew attention to the link between the Doha Ministerial Conference and the Conference on Financing For Development and the Summit on Sustainable Development to be held in Johannesburg in the end of August 2002.","WTCOMTDM38.pdf","Secretariat, WTO, Secretariat, Director-General, IMF, Köhler, World, Bank, Wolfensohn, WTO, Moore, United, Nations, Kofi, Annan, Johannesburg"

He added that in the chapter on trade, the draft text of the Monterrey Consensus had proposed a summit welcoming the implementation of the WTO decisions which had placed the needs and interests of developing countries at the centre of a WTO work programme and outlined the issues of concern to developing countries. Among other things he said that the draft text of the Monterrey Consensus had also recognized the importance of enhanced and predictable access for the exports of developing countries to all markets; called on developed countries that had not already done so, to work towards the objective of duty-free and quota-free access for all LDCs exports; called for additional bilateral and multilateral support and cooperation in areas of trade-related training, capacity-building, institution building, trade supporting services; and to commit Members to enhance the role of regional and subregional agreements and free-trade areas in consistency with the                                                                                    WT/COMTD/M/38                                                                                           Page 23 multilateral trading system. The other two sections of the Monterrey Consensus with particular relevance to the WTO were those that dealt with systemic issues and ""staying engaged"". In the section that dealt with systemic issues the text proposed that policy and programme coordination of international institutions and coherence at the national and international levels should be encouraged to meet the development goals of the Millennium Declaration. He said that the Secretariat felt that the mandate should be representative of the full membership and should be based on clear, simple and objective criteria so as to ensure the effectiveness of a global economic system which supported development. It should also identify areas where relationship between the UN and the WTO could be improved and where capacity to provide technical assistance could be strengthened. He went on to say that in the 'staying engaged' section, the text proposed that for the purposes of follow-up and coordination, the UN General Assembly and Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC) as well as intergovernmental and governing bodies of other institutional stakeholders would engage in preliminary consultations on the issues and address the issue of coherence, coordination and cooperation as a follow-up to the Conference at the spring meetings. It was proposed that the current high-level dialogue on strengthening international cooperation for development which was held every two years in General Assembly, would be reconstituted to include a policy dialogue with participation of 11 stakeholders under implementation of the results of the Conference. He said that copies of the final version of the agreed draft text of the Monterrey Consensus with UN document symbol A/AC.257/L.13 was available in all three working languages for the information of delegations. Additional information on the conference and preparations for it could be found on their website at www.un.org/esa/ffd.","WTCOMTDM38.pdf","Monterrey, WTO, WTO, Monterrey, Consensus, Members, Monterrey, WTO, Secretariat, UN, WTO, UN, General, Assembly, and, Economic, and, Social, Council, General, Assembly, Monterrey, UN"

Deputy Director-General, Mr. Ablassé Ouedraogo said that the WTO, as one of the ""major institutional stakeholders"" of the process, had been represented at the final Preparatory Committee held on 14-25 January 2002 in New York City. He had had the honour to make a statement at the opening of the Preparatory Committee. A copy of the speech was available on the WTO Web-site. This meeting had been chaired by Mr. Kofi Annan. Ministers dealing with development and other institutions such as the World Bank and the IMF had also been present. The Preparatory Meeting had been able to agree on the draft text for the consideration of the Head of States and Government which covered eight areas:         (a)     Confronting challenges of financing for development the global response         (b)     Mobilizing the west financial resources.         (c)     Mobilizing international resources, foreign direct investment and all the private                 flows.         (d)     International trade as an engine for development.

At the informal meeting held on 11 December 2001 it had been agreed that the WTO Director-General would be invited to send the package of decisions agreed to at Doha Ministerial Conferernce to the Secretary-General of the United Nations for the information of the Preparatory Committee.

Mr. Patrick Low, Director, Development and Economic Research Division said that the distinction between what could actually be delivered over the Internet and what could not was fundamental and would certainly be part of the discussion. The Secretariat was in touch with the OECD who had carried out a lot of work on all aspects of taxes on the internet and hoped to get WT/COMTD/M/38 Page 22 someone from the OECD to participate in the seminar. On the question of the interaction between e- business and governments the seminar would take the broader approach.","WTCOMTDM38.pdf","Patrick, Low, Director, Development, and, Economic, Research, Division, Secretariat, OECD, OECD"
"3863",3863,"62","62.      The representative of the European Commission said he was made aware that especially on direct taxes a lot of work had been done elsewhere, including in the OECD and he invited the Secretariat to draw on their expertise if it had not already done so. Duplication of efforts could be avoided if the Secretariat looked closely at what had already been done. Where government revenue was mentioned, he preferred the discussions to be more comprehensive and include the additional revenues which would accrue from using all the benefits and possible gains from electronic commerce, including for example how the development of e-commerce would affect government revenue. It should include possible growth and possible additional services being rendered possible in a country which used electronic commerce.","WTCOMTDM38.pdf","European, Commission, OECD, Secretariat, Secretariat"
"3862",3862,"61","61.     The representative of Canada said that the idea of the seminar was a good one. She suggested that the distinction be made between e-deliverables and goods only ordered on-line in the revenue perspective. That was to say that goods only ordered on-line were delivered at the borders whereas the others were not.","WTCOMTDM38.pdf","Canada"
"3861",3861,"60","60.      Mr. Patrick Low, Director, Development and Economic Research Division said that the Secretariat had drawn up a preliminary programme and was in the process of looking for speakers. The draft programme was made available to Members and was divided into four sessions, three shorter ones in the morning and a longer one in the afternoon. The first session in the morning would consider recent data trends in e-commerce, particularly at international exchange through electronic means. The second session would focus on revenue implications and the effects of e-commerce on prospects of governments of collecting revenue, different revenue sources, focusing particularly on the development aspects of the issues and would also touch on the question of what was available in terms of information technology to assist in the collection of revenue and identification of liability. The third session in the morning would address some of those issues from a WTO perspective. The Trade in Services Division would make a presentation as it was that area in which e-commerce had been most discussed in the WTO context. In the afternoon session two or three governments would present their experiences of e-commerce in relation to the revenue issue and how they saw the difficulties and challenges. Some private sector entities would also be invited to speak on the subject. He said he hoped that the programme would provide a clear idea of the issues connected to the revenue implications of e-commerce and the challenges for revenue collection. The Secretariat would ensure that there was time for discussion and questions and answers. He invited any delegation who felt that it had an experience to share with respect to revenue implications of e-commerce to let the Secretariat know so that it could be included in the programme. He also said that the Secretariat would welcome any suggestions and guidance from delegations as to who they might approach in a private sector.","WTCOMTDM38.pdf","Patrick, Low, Director, Development, and, Economic, Research, Division, Secretariat, Members, WTO, Trade, in, Services, Division, WTO, Secretariat, Secretariat, Secretariat"

"3857",3857,"57","57.      Mrs Mariel Picado of Costa Rica said that with regard to the proportion of the investment which came from the public and the private sectors in the expansion of e-commerce she wished to give a few examples. She mentioned the work being done by a Foundation which was developing a number of initiatives in order to make fuller use of electronic technology such as the use of computers. That Foundation had tried to generalize and develop a culture of informatics and improve knowledge of informatics through a number of initiatives, such as education. Another important project was ""Communications without Borders"" which was one of the most important projects in which they were involved. It was an area in which there was a possibility of integrating the private and public sectors in order to widen the use of electronic technologies. It was in that connection her Government was developing telecentres which were equipped in order to ensure that there was widespread access to computers and internet. Agreements were being entered into between the communal and municipal associations which were providing the funding and societies which were responsible for the training. There were training centres for instructors which ensured specialized training in the field of electronics. That was something which would back up the national industry. It was a question of giving more training to the already existing skilled personnel in order to help them to produce more and better software. Lack of adequate infrastructure was an obstacle to the development of e-commerce. She said the Government of Costa Rica had taken various initiatives to improve the infrastructure and to enhance the broadband capacity necessary for on-line transactions. There were also a number of other initiatives under way. Another way of improving infrastructure would be to seek alliances with other sectors in society such as the academia and the private sector. It was important that there be a response at the legislative level as well so that the necessary reforms could be made in infrastructure area. Her Government was making an effort to improve connections throughout the country. It had ensured that the cable services expanded the possibility for connections. That process had gone in parallel with the so-called informatics culture. Even if the infrastructure was in place, appropriate use had to be made of it. There was for example a free countrywide e-mail service and there had been a broad campaign to make people aware of the existence of it. The aim was to familiarize the population with the use of electronic information technology so that they would learn how to use those services. The Government had thought that the best way of doing so was through an information campaign through which for example people would learn about the various possibilities in order to make them interested and for them to start using the service. On the customs question, she said that the Government of Costa Rica was making efforts to improve the situation with the help of new information technologies. There was an internet page which made it possible to consult decrees, administrative materials and circulars, as well as all issues and information necessary for customs procedures. There was also the possibility of consulting jurisprudence and there was information on tariff classifications, restrictions, prohibitions as well as information regarding imports and exports. With respect to customs clearance, she said that the Government had a single digital window for exports, though it did not as yet have a single window for imports. However, the Government was looking for systems which would make it possible to speed up custom processes and customs clearance.

"3856",3856,"56","56.     The representative of Senegal asked if in Costa Rica there was an electronic customs clearance in operation and if that was the case, what the repercussions of it had been on the speed of customs procedures and on the costs of customs clearance. He said that at a time when greater facility in exchange was being discussed, it was good that some countries did use electronic means in the customs sphere. It would be useful if delegations could get more information and some figures on the impact of the use of electronic means on customs clearance procedures.","WTCOMTDM38.pdf","Senegal, Costa, Rica"
"3855",3855,"55","55.      The representative of Rwanda said that it appeared that the example of Costa Rica was a demonstration of a new era of development, similar to the industrial revolution which had its roots in England and then had gone to the West and then into Japan and other eastern countries. There was already a gap between the West and the rest of the World and it seemed that if a country did not take advantage of the new electronic means, another cleavage would be created. Since his delegation was interested in the use of those new electronic means he asked what percentage of the investment was by the State and what percentage was private investment, in the extension and expansion of the electronics market. It seemed that it was a nationwide programme. He went on to ask what the WT/COMTD/M/38 Page 20 likelihood was of success in a developing country where the degree of illiteracy was high and where the telecommunications services were underdeveloped. He also asked what advice she could give to the Governments of such countries.","WTCOMTDM38.pdf","Rwanda, Costa, Rica, England, West, Japan"
"3854",3854,"54","54.     Mrs. Mariel Picado referred to the question regarding the system of telecommunications and said that the coverage was high and that there was a Costa Rican electricity company which was responsible for the service. It had been in operation for many years in Costa Rica and its 95 per cent coverage had made it possible to reach areas located far from any centres; including distant rural areas which otherwise would not have had access. The Costa Rican Electricity Institute was the one responsible for telecommunications and electricity. The internet infrastructure had been made available to the majority of the population and she underlined the fact that one of the important questions being studied at the present time in Costa Rica was the quest of an advanced internet network. As indicated in her presentation, they would probably use optic fibre rings across the board in the country, thus taking advantage of the copper-based network which would make it possible to integrate the transmission of voice and images at high speed and thus reduce the costs of the connections and ensure access because of the wider band width. On the question of tourism she said that tourism was important to Costa Rica's economy. Different websites were being developed in order to promote Costa Rica as a tourist centre and to indicate the various services available in the different areas and sites of the country. She said the Government had created one main entry point to Costa Rica on the Internet.","WTCOMTDM38.pdf","Mariel, Picado, Costa, Rica, Costa, Rican, Electricity, Institute, Costa, Rica, Costa, Rica, Costa, Rica, Costa, Rica"

The representative of the European Communities said that though he did not represent a developing country, the systematic approach which the Government of Costa Rica had adopted was probably of interest to all Members. It was clear that the telecommunications infrastructure in Costa Rica was already good, an important element in implementing any programme of e-commerce. He asked how that had been achieved and what sort of problems the Government of Costa Rica had encountered and in which way it had gone about ensuring such a high coverage of access and such a good infrastructure.","WTCOMTDM38.pdf","European, Communities, Costa, Rica, Members, Costa, Rica, Costa, Rica"

"3846",3846,"47","47.      The representative of the European Communities said that his delegation disagreed fundamentally with the Secretariat as it still could not fully see how the change of priorities which should have come about from the Doha Ministerial Declaration and the Decisions was reflected in the Plan. A Plan should be the Members’ Plan. He had consulted with the Secretariat and had made numerous comments on how the Plan should be structured. He had no disagreement with any other Member on the content of the Plan, but he did tell that it was time that the Members were a bit more proactive and got another chance to comment on the document. His delegation did not want to micro- manage anything or stop the Secretariat from implementing the activities which were on call. However, he wished to see a Plan that was politically useable and which fully reflected what had been agreed to at the Doha Ministerial Conference. The Plan, as it was presented, did not represent the sort of response which his delegation was looking for. The dilemma, for example, on the Singapore issues was a simple question of presentation. There was no disagreement that there would be several activities linked to the issues in paragraph 23 of the Doha Ministerial Declaration. The only question was what to do with paragraph 21 and the illusion given that a decision had already been taken to negotiate these issues. That was also a question of presentation. There was no fundamental disagreement that something had to be done on the Singapore issues. He did not accept the argument that there was a dilemma which made the Plan impossible to change or presented with more information on cooperation with other international organizations. He asked why there could not be a section on industrial tariffs which some delegations had asked for, as there was one on investment. Members were clear on the sort of action which they wished to see. However, that did not mean that everything had to be done from scratch. It was important to make the Plan a tool which allowed Members to track various themes throughout the year. His delegation could agree to take note of the Plan. However, there had to be a change of focus in the WTO. That was why he had said that the Plan should be endorsed, not just be taken note of. As the Pledging Conference was to take place in three weeks time, his delegation could not endorse the Plan in its current form as the basic document for that Conference. These issues should be resolved quickly in an informal process to arrive at a Plan which corresponded to the political imperatives which Members were working under, after the Doha Ministerial Conference.","WTCOMTDM38.pdf","European, Communities, Secretariat, Members, Secretariat, Member, Members, Secretariat, Doha, Ministerial, Conference, Singapore, Singapore, Members, Members, WTO, Members, Doha, Ministerial, Conference"
"3845",3845,"46","46.      The representative of the United States said that as the WTO also had an e-commerce agenda which cross-cutted into various different bodies it was important that wherever there was the opportunity to use on-line resources, the WTO should be prepared to do so. She mentioned the fact that the agenda included a presentation by a developing country to explain its experience on the use of electronic commerce. The ITC had been extremely proactive in taking advantage of on-line tools to be able to train and to show developing countries how to use the on-line process to access markets. WT/COMTD/M/38 Page 18 She hoped that on-line aspects would not become such a weak link that her delegation had to question the initiatives. Her delegation appreciated the element contained in the Plan related to video- conferencing but noticed that there was a conditionality attached to video-conferencing as the WTO Secretariat had to use video-conferencing even for its internal work in coordinating with other agencies interested in trade. The Secretariat could not necessarily meet the demand even if it wanted to. Weak links existed in all missions and at all kinds of places, even in developed countries. However, it was important to move along this line with the technology available and with the recognition that it would be possible to further progress as the technology became more widespread and available. On the Singapore issues she agreed with the Secretariat and said that it was important to recognize the sensitivities. There should be language that covered both views of the issue since this was an area seriously negotiated at the Doha Ministerial Conference.","WTCOMTDM38.pdf","United, States, WTO, WTO, ITC, WTO, Secretariat, Secretariat, Singapore, Secretariat, Doha, Ministerial, Conference"
"3844",3844,"45","45.     He went on to say that on the issue of seminars he had not fully understood the problem with the use of this tool for technical assistance. For example there could be a request for WTO resource persons to show members how to schedule commitments for specific commitments on trade in services. Seminars spanned the gamut of such activities. They could be of a general nature or they could be of a technical nature. However, he knew the issue was tied to the LDCs' position that the Secretariat should deal with supply-side matters based on the Ministerial Declaration. The LDCs argued that they could make that case because there was a mandate in paragraph 42 and 43 of the Doha Ministerial Declaration. Secondly, some work had been undertaken within the IF which involved complementary work by other agencies, as there were issues that the WTO could not undertake on its own. On the question on the follow-up to the IF pilot scheme, which was currently under way in three countries he said that it would be extended to approximately five more LDCs and that an issue that still remained was the follow-up to some of the priority technical assistance recommendations arising from that. His final point was on the question of whether the Doha Development Agenda also covered the Singapore issues. He said it did, as it would cover all the issues and mandates that were listed in the table on page 6 of the Plan. There were several other limited questions, that he would take up with individual delegations such as the question by the representative of Ghana on the applicability of technical assistance activities for African countries with the JITAP and the clarification sought by the representative of China. The implementation of the Plan would continue as soon as consensus was reached on areas of improvement.","WTCOMTDM38.pdf","WTO, Secretariat, LDCs, WTO, Doha, Development, Agenda, Singapore, Ghana, China"
"3843",3843,"44","44.     He continued to say that coordination had a cost and required enhanced capacities. The Secretariat would attempt to coordinate its activities and it was doing so within the IF. Deputy Director-General Ravier had given examples of the coordination exercises that the Secretariat had undertaken since the last meeting. The first was the 25 January trade and competition policy course;                                                                                     WT/COMTD/M/38                                                                                            Page 17 the second was a week thereafter on trade and investment. DDG Ravier had also referred to the coordination meeting on 19 February with regard to the technical assistance database. The Secretariat would continue such efforts. However, coordination was always not that simple and it was not coordination that limited the operational activities. For instance, in delivering a technical cooperation activity it was possible to find two different organizations taking different positions on subsidies, one encouraging subsidies and the other organization discouraging it. It therefore had to be recognized that there was a limit to the coordination including in the context of the limitation of mandates, capacity and resources of different organizations. Moreover, coordination was not limited to inter- agency coordination. There should be coordination amongst donors, coordination amongst agencies and coordination amongst beneficiary countries. He went on to the issue of UNCTAD and said that the WTO Secretariat was not in a position to address the question of the role of UNCTAD. However, he could confirm that the WTO and UNCTAD Secretariats were working together in a constructive, positive and practical manner and wished to continue to do so. With regard to regional institutions he referred to the statement by the Director-General in the General Council on 13 February 2002. Connections had been established and were being established with the many regional agencies and commissions. There would be a meeting of the Inter-American Development Bank and the WTO on 27 February 2002. They would be working together and other agencies had been invited, as well as some of the coordinators of informal groups within the WTO. Together they would see how they could make best use of the best practices of each. On the issue of the strategy, he said the Secretariat has proceeded on the basis of the strategy endorsed in paragraph 38. On the point made with regard to presumption of negotiations in certain areas, he clarified that no such presumptions had been made. The Plan for technical assistance activities was not a negotiating document. Essentially, what it contained was references to the Strategy for WTO technical cooperation and a listing of operational activities. The Plan was based on Members' demands. He said the Secretariat had a compilation of the requests from Members for activities, both written and requests made by telephone. The Secretariat was prepared to making them available to any delegation who wished to see the requests.","WTCOMTDM38.pdf","Secretariat, Director-General, Ravier, Secretariat, Ravier, Secretariat, UNCTAD, WTO, Secretariat, UNCTAD, WTO, UNCTAD, Director-General, General, Council, Inter-American, Development, Bank, WTO, WTO, Secretariat, WTO, Members, Secretariat, Members, Secretariat"

Mr. Cheidu Osakwe, Director, Technical Cooperation Division said that it was possible to put the comments made into three categories: first, any consensus that was apparent in the remarks made by Members; secondly, the dilemmas and irreconcilable positions; and finally, the specific questions asked, including the request for clarifications. He began by saying there was obviously no consensus on the Plan as yet; if there had been it would have shown that the Plan was perfect. The possibility of a perfect plan simply did not exist. First there were the Singapore issues versus the traditional issues. Several Members had said that there should be more emphasis on the Singapore issues, and that the Plan be tuned to the negotiating agenda, others had said that this should not be done. Secondly, some members had asked the Secretariat to engage in a programme approach while others had asked for the activities to be more project-oriented. Thirdly, many of the providers had encouraged the consumers of technical assistance to identify their priorities and to list their needs. Yet, on the other hand many of the same members had said to the Secretariat that they did not want to see a list. The final dilemma was that between the strategies that Members wished to see anew and the strategy that Members had adopted in paragraph 38 of the Ministerial Declaration. He said the Secretariat welcomed discussions and would attempt to make the adjustments required by Members. However, Members had to recognize that there were divergences which the Secretariat could not bridge. It was up to the Members to bridge some of these dilemmas themselves.","WTCOMTDM38.pdf","Cheidu, Osakwe, Director, Technical, Cooperation, Division, Members, Singapore, Members, Singapore, Secretariat, Secretariat, Members, Members, Secretariat, Members, Members, Secretariat, Members"

Therefore, neither in terms of activities nor in terms of coordination with other international agencies or with bilateral donors, had the Secretariat considered that it was starting from scratch. It was because technical assistance was part of a continuum that the Secretariat had not indicated which activities responded to each individual article of the Doha Ministerial Declaration. Members had also defined a number of needs prior to the Doha Ministerial Conference and there had to be continuity with respect to those activities. However, the Secretariat had taken note of the fact that Members wished the Secretariat to link the activities to the Doha Ministerial Declaration. He then went on to talk about coordination, indicating that there were different ways of pursuing coordination. He however emphasized that from the very beginning, two-thirds of the WTO’s technical assistance activities had been carried out in co-operation with a number of organizations, one of which was UNCTAD, which he believed after regional development banks was the WTO's main partner.","WTCOMTDM38.pdf","Secretariat, Secretariat, Members, Secretariat, Members, Secretariat, WTO, UNCTAD, WTO"
"3840",3840,"41","41.      He went on to comment on the limitations and constraints in the Plan and its implementation. The limitations belonged to three or four broad categories: the number of activities, the cost of the activities and the human resources that could be devoted to the activities. The greater the number of activities the greater the cost and the greater the time devoted and therefore human resources required. The basic features of the Plan was that the number of regional activities was much higher than in the past. That had two direct consequences. From a financial point of view, it costed more per activity though less in terms of human resources. A regional activity was quite costly, even though a larger number of countries could be covered. That was one of the characteristics of the Plan and that was one of the ways in which the Secretariat was able to address these limitations. He took note of the suggestion that had been made regarding the implementation of on-line activities and said that the Secretariat would explore and take advantage of every possibility to use effective technological means in order to save time and money. However, it was entirely dependent on technology in that respect which for instance meant that on-line would depend on the weakest element of the chain, which in many countries was often telecommunications capacity.","WTCOMTDM38.pdf","Secretariat, Secretariat"
"3839",3839,"40","40.      Deputy Director-General, Mr Paul-Henri Ravier said that the status of the document was a procedural problem which needed clarification. The aim was not to spend the entire year to perfect the 2002 Plan but to implement it. About 13 per cent of the working year had already elapsed and only 11 per cent of the activities had been carried out. However, it was understandable since implementation was always slower early in any year. Nevertheless, it was not desirable to delay implementation of the Plan any further. He insisted that it was the Member's Plan, not the Secretariat’s. Revision 1 of the Plan was actually the sixth or eighth version as the Plan had been developed through consultations between the Secretariat and the Members. Such consultations had been held since the end of November 2001. Though the Plan could be improved on the basis of the remarks made by delegations, perfection may not be that easily achievable. The aim should be to have a working document of the Committee. He did not think that the objective should be to adopt the document formally on a consensus basis as that would delay its implementation. It was true that the CTD had other commitments and there were other essential issues to be debated in the CTD. It was not in the interest of the membership at large that the CTD became the management committee for technical assistance although that had not been the situation in the past. No matter how important technical assistance had become as a result of the Doha Ministerial Conference, he did not believe that it was the mission of the CTD to be exclusively occupied with technical assistance. Members should ideally take note of all the comments which had been made and for the Secretariat to remain open to further comments and remarks from the membership. He agreed with the notion that a plan is a plan and by its very definition must be amenable to changes. He said 10 to 15 per cent of the activities contained in the Plan would be cancelled in the course of the year for one reason or another and would be replaced by an equivalent number or a higher number of activities which were not yet planned. If Members were locked into a Plan adopted by consensus, every time an activity was cancelled or WT/COMTD/M/38 Page 16 added Members would have to meet in order to adjust the Plan. He did not think that this was what anybody wished to see happen.","WTCOMTDM38.pdf","Director-General, Paul-Henri, Ravier, Member, Secretariat, Secretariat, Members, Committee, CTD, CTD, CTD, CTD, Members, Secretariat, Members, Page, 16, Members"

The Chairman recalled that, at previous sessions of CTD it had been agreed to invite the following inter-governmental organizations on an ad hoc meeting by meeting basis: the Arab Maghreb Union (AMU), the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS), the Economic Corporation Organization (ECO), the Inter-Arab Investment Guarantee Corporation, the Islamic Development Bank (IDB), the Organization of African Unity (OAU), the Organization of the Islamic Conference, (OIC) the South Centre, the South Pacific Forum, the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), the West African Economic and Monetary Union (WAEMU), and the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO). He proposed that those Organizations be invited to the next formal meeting of CTD and that, in view of the forthcoming special sessions of the Committee on special and differential treatment, those Organizations be invited to any formal session held before the next regular session.","WTCOMTDM38.pdf","Chairman, CTD, Economic, Community, of, West, ECOWAS, Economic, Corporation, Organization, Inter-Arab, Investment, Guarantee, Corporation, Islamic, Development, Bank, IDB, Organization, of, African, Unity, OAU, OIC, South, Centre, South, Pacific, Forum, United, Nations, Environment, Programme, UNEP, West, African, Economic, and, Monetary, Union, WAEMU, World, Intellectual, Property, Organization, WIPO, CTD, Committee"
"3837",3837,"39","39.      Deputy Director General, Mr Andrew Stoler said that a question had been posed regarding whether it would be possible to fully cover some of the Singapore issues such as trade and investment in the global financial envelope. He responded that this may be possible provided it was possible to marginally increase the CHF 15 million associated with the Doha Development Agenda Global Trust Fund. There might actually not even be a need for CHF 16.3 to achieve all activities as the Secretariat had been conservative in the estimates of what the cost-sharing arrangements would contribute. He said that delegations would recall that, at the end of 2001 the Secretariat had asked donors who had contributed money into the existing trust funds whether they would agree to roll over that money into the DDAGTF for 2002. A number of them had agreed to do that. Others had raised some queries. However, it meant the fund was not starting from zero in terms of the amount that was needed at the Pledging Conference. On the issue of having a more detailed ventilation of the figures given on a global basis, he said that the copies of his remarks which had been distributed referred to the standard used costing that the Secretariat had used in arriving at the estimates of costs of the individual activities. It would show what the relative costs of the individual activities in the document were. However, delegations would not be able to see what exactly the cost-sharing would be with some of the agencies with which there was a cooperative effort. On the point raised about whether the figures could go up or not, his answer was clearly yes. He said that the Secretariat saw the CHF 15 million or even the CHF 16.3 million as a conservative estimate of what would be the absolute minimum to accomplish the planned activities. The numbers represented the minimum funding required for the existing set of planned activities. If delegations were willing to contribute more to the Trust Fund through the pledging exercise, new activities could be identified, provided that the Secretariat had the capacity to deliver in terms of its own resources or outsourced resources. Lastly, in response to what would happen in the event of a shortfall, he reminded delegations that it was in order to deal with exactly such a possibility that a buffer account of CHF 1 million had been provided for in the Global Trust Fund as agreed to in 2001 by the General Council. That buffer account was intended to deal with a situation in which there was a temporary shortfall in contributions received from delegations.","WTCOMTDM38.pdf","Director, Andrew, Stoler, Singapore, Doha, Development, Agenda, Global, Trust, Fund, Secretariat, Secretariat, Secretariat, Secretariat, Secretariat, General, Council"
"3836",3836,"38","38.      The representative of Bolivia said that he agreed with many of the comments made regarding improvements and felt that these could be introduced as the Plan was implemented. If Members considered the ambitious objectives set out in the Doha Ministerial Declaration and felt that the assistance provided in the Plan would not meet their requirements, they could say so. However, his delegation recognized that what was in the Plan was as much as could be reasonably expected from the WTO Secretariat. The Plan did have a strong capacity strengthening and training component. He agreed with other delegations about the need to start implementing the Plan at the earliest. During the implementation of the seminars and courses in the Plan, it might be useful for developing countries if the WTO Secretariat could coordinate with other specialized agencies that had particular knowledge in the given areas. It would be also important to ensure a multiplying effect in the beneficiary countries, by working in cooperation with local institutes that dealt with trade matters and with local training institutes. That would not involve changing the guidelines of the Plan. A multiplying effect could be achieved by finding different local entities that might be able to disseminate the information                                                                                    WT/COMTD/M/38                                                                                           Page 15 the WTO was providing. If the Member concerned agreed, other methods such as the internet and other means to reach a broader public could be used.","WTCOMTDM38.pdf","Bolivia, Members, WTO, Secretariat, WTO, Secretariat, WTO, Member"
"3835",3835,"37","37.     The Ambassador of Paraguay said that, even though the statements had been substantive, his delegation still felt that if the Committee continued to review the Coordinated WTO Technical Assistance Plan, they would reach the end of the year without developing countries having received the technical cooperation they needed in order to be able to participate in the work programme arising out of the Fourth Ministerial Conference. His delegation wished to see the Plan enforced and believed that necessary adjustments could be introduced as its implementation progressed. He quoted the Spanish saying “perfection is the enemy of the good” as he believed that the Plan was already good. A number of activities had been scheduled for February 2002, including one in Paraguay. It was important to commence the activities already scheduled in the Plan and not to wait until the Plan was perfect. It was better to enforce the Plan as it was and to introduce the adjustments as the need arose.","WTCOMTDM38.pdf","Ambassador, Paraguay, Committee, Coordinated, WTO, Technical, Assistance, Plan, Paraguay"
"3834",3834,"36","36.      The representative of Indonesia said that his delegation shared the concern expressed by the delegations of India and Malaysia with regard to the wording in paragraph 1 of Annex 1 of the Plan. He sought clarification on Annex 5 of the Plan which showed the number of planned activities per region. The figures in one column gave the percentage of region over subtotal. The percentage for the Asian/Pacific region was 20 per cent whereas the number of countries and the share of the world population located in the Asian/Pacific region was much larger. He therefore asked what the rational for the 20 per cent figure was.","WTCOMTDM38.pdf","Indonesia, India, Malaysia"
"3833",3833,"35","35.      The representative of Egypt asked for clarification with respect to the three other levels of technical cooperation. The response to his question might respond to some of the concerns raised by others with respect to the cooperation with UNCTAD. The second level of cooperation was referred to in the second indent of paragraph 2 on page 3 of the revised Plan. He asked whether a document would be published by the WTO regarding that level of cooperation as well as regarding the cooperation with the OECD mentioned in subparagraph 4 of paragraph 2. He said that he was aware that UNCTAD had already drafted a document regarding technical cooperation with respect to the Doha Ministerial Declaration and he believed that that document had been drafted in close cooperation with the WTO Secretariat. If he had understood the Plan, it referred exclusively to activities to be delivered by the WTO Secretariat, and as was stated in the document ""to an extent in coordination with multilateral agencies with related competence"". If everything was taken together delegations would get a complete view of all ongoing activities and the degree of coordination and cooperation that had been established among agencies.","WTCOMTDM38.pdf","Egypt, UNCTAD, WTO, OECD, UNCTAD, WTO, Secretariat, WTO, Secretariat"
"3832",3832,"34","34.      The representative of Pakistan said that technical cooperation and capacity-building were core activities of the WTO as confirmed by the Doha Ministerial Declaration. The negotiations agreed at the Doha Ministerial Conference and the recommendation of continuing the work programme on the Singapore issues and other subjects made it crucial that an effective technical assistance and capacity- building strategy be put in place. The Coordinated WTO Secretariat Annual Technical Assistance Plan for 2002 was a testimony of the fact that the Secretariat attached importance to technical assistance and capacity-building. The Revised Plan appeared to be a good basis. However, even if technical assistance and capacity-building were important, they were only one side of the development dimension of the multilateral trading system. More important was the need to inject a development dimension into the rules and disciplines, both in the existing ones and in those which Members would agree on in the future. There should be no presumption of any negotiations on issues on which there was no Ministerial mandate. He therefore supported the views expressed by the representative of India. Suggestions made by the representative of the United States regarding on-line training were good and merited consideration. He said he was surprised that other WTO bodies had not been consulted in the preparation of the Plan. There was a need for maintaining greater coordination with other WTO bodies in order for Members to get effective assistance from the Plan. He went on to say that one-day seminars might not be the best way to achieve the desired goal. In that regard, the importance of objective and analytic research studies and hands-on training could not WT/COMTD/M/38 Page 14 be over-emphasized. He looked forward to a final document which would take into account the concerns expressed by the various delegations. He concluded by saying that all Members were allocating resources, both human and financial, for the implementation of the activities, and he hoped that the Secretariat would put in place some sort of auditing or monitoring system which would ensure the effectiveness of the Plan and enable periodic evaluations of its effectiveness.","WTCOMTDM38.pdf","Pakistan, WTO, Doha, Ministerial, Conference, Singapore, WTO, Secretariat, Secretariat, Members, India, United, States, WTO, WTO, Members, Members, Secretariat"
"3831",3831,"33","33.      The representative of Canada said her delegation recognized that further work was required and supported the proposal for linkages with other WTO bodies by having them put technical assistance and capacity-building on their agenda. She welcomed the first efforts to deliver on the Plan and cooperate with other organizations. There were many appropriate and important organizations that should be mentioned in the Plan such as UNCTAD, UNEP, FAO, WIPO, UNIDO, APEC, IDB, the Asian Development Bank and the World Bank. The Heads of Agency meeting of the Integrated Framework was a good idea in that respect. However, she recalled that the IF was a tripartite relationship between the agencies, the donors and the LDCs and said that it might be appropriate to invite at least the Chair of the IF Steering Committee, and/or the two donor and two LDC representatives to attend that meeting as the perspectives of all should be heard.","WTCOMTDM38.pdf","Canada, WTO, UNCTAD, UNEP, FAO, WIPO, UNIDO, APEC, IDB, Asian, Development, Bank, World, Bank, Integrated, Framework, LDCs, IF, Steering, Committee, LDC"
"3830",3830,"32","32.       The representative of Switzerland said he had five brief points. Firstly, he said that his delegation was satisfied with the share of technical activities directed to the LDCs, which represented 50 per cent of the total. However, he supported the suggestion made by the representative of India that the figure might be deceiving. He asked the Secretariat to assure that the share of 50 per cent in favour of LDCs was established. Secondly, his delegation supported the view expressed that all areas identified in the Doha Ministerial Declaration for technical assistance should be supported equally from the Global Trust Fund, including the Singapore issues. Thirdly, his delegation was concerned about how the Members could provide support to the Secretariat in its endeavours. He explicitly called for the ad hoc requests to be limited to the barest minimum. Fourthly, he asked whether the large number of activities planned could really be carried out with the in-house staff available. It was still an open question to Members as how the priorities should be established if it became clear that all the activities could not be carried out with the human resources at the disposal in the Secretariat. Lastly, he said his delegation hoped to receive information on the work and methodology of the newly created unit of the Technical Cooperation Audit.","WTCOMTDM38.pdf","Switzerland, LDCs, India, Secretariat, Singapore, Members, Secretariat, Members, Secretariat, Technical, Cooperation, Audit"

He pointed out that only eight African countries were beneficiaries of the JITAP and the JITAP had its own activities. The programme would in principle end in June 2002, although it might be extended. He asked if the title implied that the activities in the technical assistance Plan for countries which were beneficiaries of JITAP would be carried out within the framework of the JITAP. If that was the case, the Missions should have been alerted to tell their Governments to adjust the activities of the JITAP in cooperation with the executing agencies of which WTO was a prominent one.","WTCOMTDM38.pdf","Ghana, WTO"
"3828",3828,"30","30.      The representative of China noted the remarks made by Mr. Ravier with respect to cooperation between the WTO and other international organizations, including the relevant UN bodies, in delivering technical cooperation to developing country Members. Such cooperation and partnerships were important as the organizations carried out complementary activities. Members should make full use of the comparative advantages of all international organizations. He referred to the tables in the Plan and sought clarification regarding the content of the fourth column entitled ""Cooperation with"". He said that, for example, on page 31 projects for Cambodia had been listed, while in the fourth column it was mentioned that this would be in cooperation with UNCTAD. He was unsure whether that activity was sponsored by the WTO with the cooperation of the UNCTAD Secretariat or whether it was sponsored by UNCTAD with the cooperation of the WTO Secretariat. That had to be made clear, otherwise it would create a precedent as to which other activities might be included in the tables. He concluded by saying that there could be amendments to the Plan later and that there could always be room for improvement during its implementation. There was therefore no need to continue to work on revisions as it would be too time-consuming. A Plan was a Plan and there was no such thing as a perfect Plan. The Secretariat had to be given a certain amount of flexibility in its implementation of the Plan.

"3826",3826,"29","29.      The representative of Malaysia said that the language in Annex 1 of the Plan gave the impression that Members had already agreed that negotiations would take place on the Singapore issues. He said that that was a decision for the Members to take. The matter should not be prejudged by the Secretariat because, according to the Doha Ministerial Declaration, it was clear that Members were to decide on how and what they would do with the Singapore issues at the Fifth Ministerial Conference. Delegations could not, at this point in time, accept that it be stated that the technical assistance provided should be geared towards negotiations in those issues. He agreed with the proposal that there should be coordination between the Committee and the other bodies in the WTO so that Members knew what each body was doing, in order to avoid duplication of technical assistance. He asked whether there was a deadline for agreeing to a final document in view of the imminent holding of the Pledging Conference. The Plan should be finalized as soon as possible and scheduled activities should not be put on hold. He add that these activities could be implemented even though the document had not been approved. He further asked that if a final CTD document was approved by the General Council, did it mean that no further requests could be made for technical assistance, or if, since it was a living document, changes, amendments and additions could still be made as Governments needs changed. He stressed that the possibility to change the Plan through the course of the year should exist. In addition he sought clarification as to whether, when further changes were made, the costing would be adjusted accordingly and how a possible shortfall in available resources would be dealt with. In connection to what had been said concerning the role of other international organizations he believed that information on the work being undertaken by other international organizations would be helpful. As most technical assistance to his Government was channelled through the WTO, information on other agencies in Malaysia which may have requested technical assistance directly from other international organizations, would be useful. The WTO’s role would therefore be a clearing-house of some kind. He asked if the activities of other international organizations were to be included in the document, would it be for information only, or if the WTO would have an overseeing role so that Members would have to go through the WTO to request assistance from other international organizations.","WTCOMTDM38.pdf","Malaysia, Members, Singapore, Members, Secretariat, Members, Singapore, Committee, WTO, Members, CTD, General, Council, WTO, Malaysia, WTO, WTO, Members, WTO"
"3825",3825,"28","28.       The representative of Belize said he thought it was critical to ensure that what was delivered corresponded to the needs of the Members. However, Members had an important role to play in that regard. The technical assistance to be provided over the next two to three years seemed to involve a range of interconnected activities of both donors and partners. That raised the question of how the divergent expectations could be assessed and how those divergences would be addressed. That was critical in ensuring the success of the WTO’s Technical Assistance Plan. It was important to consider what would happen in the period subsequent to the capacity-building phase. He was concerned that a number of Members who were eager to integrate their respective trade strategies into the multilateral trading system in a fashion that would allow them to realize their respective development objectives, WT/COMTD/M/38 Page 12 would be faced with various constraints. Members expressing a will to integrate should be provided with opportunities and support to do so. He suggested an analysis of the constraints of trade, in particular of how it related to the developmental needs and interests of the countries that would benefit from technical assistance and capacity-building. He said that he had only raised this issue as a way of identifying means of identifying how those countries could be facilitated in further integrating into the multinational trading system. He supported the suggestion made by the representative of the United States of having the Chairman coordinate with the Chairmen of other bodies to ensure that there was homogeneity with regards to the delivery of technical assistance.","WTCOMTDM38.pdf","Belize, Members, Members, WTO, Members, Members, United, States, Chairman"

The representative of Tunisia said his delegation welcomed the new changes introduced in the Plan in light of the observations made by delegations in the last meeting of the CTD, in particular regarding the link between the Plan and the Doha Ministerial Declaration. His delegation supported what had been said by the delegations from Venezuela, Cuba and the Ambassador of Zambia for more cooperation with international organizations, in particular with UNCTAD since that organization had a long experience in the field of trade. He was concerned as his Government's requests had not being taken fully into consideration, since the activity planned to take place in Tunisia in the previous plan, had apparently been removed in the revised version. He requested the Secretariat to provide an explanation, preferably in written form.","WTCOMTDM38.pdf","Tunisia, CTD, Venezuela, Cuba, Ambassador, Zambia, UNCTAD, Tunisia, Secretariat"
"3823",3823,"26","26.      The representative of Norway said that her country would be interested in continuing discussions on how the Plan evolved. Her delegation sought a coordinated approach to technical assistance and wished to avoid overlap, duplication and any differences between international organizations and other bodies, about which agency was most competent in the different areas. It had to be ensured that everything was covered and that there was no lacunae. It was important that the Plan and the proposed activities were clear, as should be their connection to the commitments made at the Doha Ministerial Conference. She said that many delegations had stressed the importance of coordination with other multilateral institutions, but it was important that Members knew which those organizations were. The database would be important in that context as it would provide information about who was doing what. It was not only UNCTAD which carried out activities of interest. Members should give thought to the suggestion made to have technical assistance dealt with on the agendas of the different bodies as they had a more hands on approach to the questions concerned. It was important that the programme be followed up and that it be made as concrete as possible. She said that her delegation had asked itself what the WTO’s role would be in the IF process and what the follow-up should be. She felt that there seemed to be an imbalance in the distribution of activities in the Plan. She noted what the delegation of India had said on Annex 5, and agreed that issue should be looked into. She continued by saying that when it came to identifying the activities that addressed the different commitments in Doha Ministerial Declaration, it was important that there was more focus on the Singapore issues, than the Plan currently seemed to have. It was also important because the Plan was a living document and as delegations went into negotiations and analysis of the different issues there would be more demands from delegations for assistance in those areas.","WTCOMTDM38.pdf","Norway, Doha, Ministerial, Conference, Members, UNCTAD, Members, WTO, India, Doha, Singapore"
"3822",3822,"25","25.      She went on to say that the revised Plan contained improvements, such as the chart linking some of the activities to paragraphs of the Doha Ministerial Declaration. Trade facilitation was mentioned only a few times in the various listings even though. Her delegation knew from bilateral discussions that a number of governments had requested assistance in the area of trade facilitation. However, she recognized that the listings only represented requests which had been made. Nevertheless notwithstanding what Members had in the Doha Ministerial Declaration, assistance in the area of trade facilitation was something that the WTO should coordinate with other agencies. She agreed with the Ambassador of Zambia on the importance of coordination with other multilateral agencies. More thought should be put into what other organizations could contribute to in joint efforts. She emphasized that a certain amount of bilateral technical assistance was always available globally and appreciated the setting up of a database that would make it easy for beneficiaries to know exactly what was being provided bilaterally. A lot of the bilateral assistance was directly trade-                                                                                     WT/COMTD/M/38                                                                                            Page 11 related. However, her delegation had sometimes found that representatives of different beneficiaries might not always be aware of the assistance provided on the ground. There was a need for more coordination on the ground to recognize the linkages. More could be done on-line and that this might be useful for providing some training on-line, a tool she said should be explored. On the issue of the Pledging Conference, her delegation sought clarification on whether Ministers were expected to attend. She also asked for updated information regarding who was invited. In other meetings, delegations had indicated they wished to contribute in kind. All contributions were equally important and it should be ensured that the Pledging Conference was inclusive in this respect. The focus of the Conference was on the Global Trust Fund and her Government was ready to make its contribution of US$1 million and was in the process of discussing with the Secretariat the transfer of other funds into that pool.","WTCOMTDM38.pdf","Members, WTO, Ambassador, Zambia, Secretariat"
"3821",3821,"24","24.      The representative of the United States said that she appreciated the effort the Secretariat had made in further revising the Annual Plan and appreciated that Deputy Director-General Ravier had clarified the understanding that the Secretariat was still not looking for an approval of the document. Her delegation looked forward to participating in the discussions with the Budget Committee, and appreciate Deputy Director-General Stoler's information on costings. Her delegation's understanding was that the Plan reflected Members' requests for assistance which had resulted in the compilation of activities that the Secretariat was planning. The Plan did not provide a qualitative basis on which to measure the effectiveness of the activities undertaken, nor to understand precisely what kind of assistance was being provided and the link to particular objectives, whether based on commitments taken at the Doha Ministerial Conference, or objectives based on already existing commitments. One of the points that had been made by the recipients in other meetings was that general seminars might not be the most appropriate way to in deliver technical assistance. She recognized that what might work in one country or region might not work in others. Delegations had also mentioned that their different levels of development in different fields meant that the assistance provided might have to vary from issue to issue and agreement to agreement. She was anxious to hear further from others about how the assistance worked on the ground. She suggested that, to further enhance the objectives in the document, the CTD should authorise its Chairperson to consult with chairpersons of other WTO bodies, committees and negotiating groups with a technical assistance element to find out if those various bodies would put technical assistance and capacity building as a regular item on their agendas in order for delegations to be regularly updated and for linkages to be made as the activities proceeded rather than having an end of the year rush to pull together what existed, what was happening and what might need to be done. Her delegation had already found that in the past years various WTO bodies dealt with technical assistance. That would become even more diverse with the new negotiating structures. Other WTO bodies had been carrying out hands on technical assistance and had been working well with other organizations, standards organizations, and customs organizations and had provided effective technical assistance. The preparation that had been done in the SPS area was a good example. It would be critical that the CTD maintained a link with the other bodies to make it easier for Members to evaluate the technical assistance activities during the ongoing year and the coming ones.","WTCOMTDM38.pdf","United, States, Secretariat, Director-General, Ravier, Secretariat, Budget, Committee, Director-General, Stoler, Members, Secretariat, CTD, Chairperson, WTO, WTO, WTO, SPS, CTD, Members"
"3820",3820,"23","23.      The representative of the European Commission said that through the Plan was a good basis for future work, it still needed some more improvement. He pointed out that the Plan was important as it was the reflection of what the WTO would need to do in response to the Doha Ministerial Declaration. In addition, the Plan was an operational document for the expenditure to be incurred under the Doha Trust Fund. His delegation therefore attached importance for the Plan to be approved at the earliest so that it could be used as a basis for the Pledging Conference on 11 March 2002. He said he believed that more should be done to clearly address the Doha commitments. He would appreciate if the activities which responded to the individual paragraphs of the Declaration were made more apparent. The column which had been added to the Annex which pointed to the relevant paragraph was a good start but did not allow delegations to understand what was being done in the different specific areas. For instance, he suggested that what was being done on implementation should be clearly defined. Paragraph 14 of the Implementation Decision adopted at the Doha Ministerial Conference made implementation a priority of WTO's work on technical assistance and capacity-building. He said that his delegation agreed that the WTO should cooperate closely with other international agencies and noted the work was under way in this regard. The WTO should also cooperate with bilateral donors, with training institutes and other activists in the field. That could be worked out in greater detail. The Plan still gave the impression that almost everything was being done by the WTO itself, which he felt was not the intention at the outset. His delegation attached importance to effective coordination between the WTO, other agencies in Geneva and across the Atlantic, and with the main donors. He said he thought that the WTO could build on the experience which the ITC had in sectors such as SPS and TBT. He asked if the Secretariat had given more thought as to what could be done on-line rather than sending officials abroad. He pointed out that in training institutes in Europe, in management institutions and in universities, a lot of training was done on-line and that was experiences the WTO could build on. He went on to say that it was his delegation's understanding that many of the short missions and the participation of WTO officials in meetings should not have been listed one by one. That inflated the number of activities. The 450 or so activities listed would appear to be exaggerated if every single mission of a WTO official was regarded as a capacity-building or technical assistance activity. The Plan had to give full attention to the Singapore issues. Annex 1 of the document was superficial and did not, for example, reflect recent cooperation between UNCTAD and WTO on investment. The Singapore issues was an area where negotiating capacity for developing countries was crucial and he hoped that this could be reflected in the document. With respect to the costing he noted that the Plan as such did not provide WT/COMTD/M/38 Page 10 any figures. He was therefore grateful for DDG Stoler's input. However, Members had to get an idea of the total figures distributed among the different activities. The Plan itself should have given a clearer idea of the cost of different activities. That should include a better idea of the importance attached to the Singapore issues as well as a clearer view of WTO participation in activities which were jointly carried out with other international organizations. Finally he said he agreed with Deputy Director-General Ravier that the Plan had to be dynamic and that it had to evolve with the experience which was being gained. His delegation would favour a clear arrangement which would allow the Secretariat and the Members to keep track of how the plan was being implemented. His delegation was ready to assist the Secretariat in every way and was confident that in doing so the Plan could be endorsed in the future.","WTCOMTDM38.pdf","European, Commission, WTO, Doha, Trust, Fund, Doha, Doha, Ministerial, Conference, WTO, WTO, WTO, WTO, WTO, Geneva, Atlantic, WTO, ITC, TBT, Secretariat, Europe, WTO, WTO, WTO, Singapore, UNCTAD, WTO, Singapore, Stoler, Members, Singapore, WTO, Director-General, Ravier, Secretariat, Members, Secretariat"
"3819",3819,"22","22.     Referring back to Annex 1 in the trade and investment part he went on to say that the Secretariat and Deputy Director-General Ravier had mentioned that this was work in progress which would be further elaborated and developed in consultation with other international agencies like UNCTAD. Analytical studies which would help developing countries understand various aspects of trade and investment could be included in that section. An analytical study of trade and investment would assist developing countries to participate effectively in regional seminars and national workshops that related to the topic. He referred to footnote 2 of the table in Annex 5 which showed the number of planned activities by region. His delegation felt that an activity could then be categorised under"" LDC activities"" even if only one LDC was participating. That footnote should then read ""Activities held in one LDC or, in the case of regional activities, those activities to which at least 50 per cent of the participants were LDCs'. It was consequently necessary to recalculate the figures in the column on the extreme right of the table. In conclusion he referred to paragraph 5, subparagraph 6, which related to technical assistance for non-residents. It was essential that non- Geneva based Missions were kept abreast of the negotiations. Minutes of formal and informal meetings in the negotiating phase should therefore be sent to the non-resident Missions. It would also assist Geneva-based delegations that were not able to participate in particular meetings. Those concerns had to be taken on board in order for his delegation to agree to the document.","WTCOMTDM38.pdf","Secretariat, Director-General, Ravier, UNCTAD"
"3818",3818,"21","21.      The representative of India mentioned that capacity-building extended to beyond holding of seminars and would require a long-term commitment. Capacity among developing countries was not equal. Many developing countries would have to start from zero. The pace of expansion of WTO activities should take the capacity of developing countries into account. In the delivery of technical assistance the Secretariat should explore the possibilities of making use of other institutions, particularly those which specialized in international trade and economic relations. Certain institutions had a good understanding of the situation in developing countries and would be able to better design specific codes for developing countries. In that respect the training of trainers in developing countries was important as such training would have a multiplier effect. He recalled the 16 January 2002 meeting of CTD, where his delegation had made some comments. He felt that those observations had not been taken on board in the revised document prepared by the Secretariat. His delegation had pointed out that in some instances when the Doha Ministerial Declaration had been recalled, phrases had been added by the Secretariat which gave a wrong impression and had the effect of changing the balance in the Ministerial Declaration. His delegation suggested that where specific paragraphs of the Doha Ministerial Declaration had been referred to, the exact language of the paragraph should be used without any revision. He drew attention to paragraphs 4 and 5 of the Document as well as Annex 1, in which it had been suggested that the Singapore issues had a certain hierarchy. His delegation did not see any specific hierarchy mentioned in the Doha Ministerial Declaration which gave either the Singapore issues or environment, a higher priority. Market access issues were equally important, if not more important. Paragraph 11 mentioned that the principle rationale of merging the WTO Development and Economic Research divisions was to adjust the Secretariat to address the development and technical cooperation and capacity-building mandates through research activities to provide factual and analytical information. His delegation found no mention of such studies in the Plan which only focused on national seminars, regional seminars and workshops and training courses. Analytical studies would assist developing countries in better understanding the various aspects involved in the post-Doha negotiations phase. Paragraph 1 of Annex 1 of the raised Plan mentioned that the Secretariat's Annual Plan for technical assistance contained activities focusing in particular on Singapore issues, so as to better prepare Members for negotiations. Technical assistance and capacity-building was intended to create awareness among the developing countries and LDCs about the implications of a multilateral framework of rules in any area and to enable them to take a decision at the Fifth Ministerial Conference when the issues relating to the start of negotiations and modalities would come up for a decision. That was clearly noted in paragraph 21 of the Doha Ministerial Declaration and any technical assistance should clearly state that the objective was to enable developing countries and LDCs to better evaluate the implication of closer multilateral cooperation for their developmental policies and objectives and human and institution development rather than what had been mentioned in the document provided by the Secretariat. He requested that his delegations concerns which had also been mentioned in the previous meeting be taken into account in order for his delegation to agree to the document. The first paragraph of Annex 2 mentioned that in paragraph 31 to 33 of the Doha Ministerial Declaration, Members had agreed to negotiations, even                                                                                      WT/COMTD/M/38                                                                                              Page 9 though this reference existed only in paragraph 31.        He requested the Secretariat to revise the document accordingly.","WTCOMTDM38.pdf","India, WTO, Secretariat, CTD, Secretariat, Secretariat, Singapore, Singapore, WTO, Development, and, Economic, Research, Secretariat, Secretariat, Singapore, Members, LDCs, LDCs, Secretariat, Members, Secretariat"
"3817",3817,"20","20.      The representative of Zambia said that the Plan was well structured and the activities clear and interesting. His delegation believed that in order for technical assistance and capacity-building to effectively support developing countries' participation in the negotiations it had to meet specific criteria. It should be designed in accordance with developing country needs and agendas. The Zanzibar Declaration provided clear guidelines in that regard. Secondly, his delegation believed that it had to encompass different topics on the trade agenda in a comprehensive manner. The key was that it be linked to Members developmental goals. Thirdly, it should recognize the need for identifying and pursuing common interests in negotiations, particularly through support to the regional and subregional integration agreements, and in particular to LDCs. He went on to say that he was aware that the WTO could deliver just one type of technical assistance, one which was focused on trade rules and the implementation of trade agreements. He believed such technical assistance to be in accordance with the WTO's mandate. At the same time, in light of WTO's limited mandate his delegation could not expect any technical assistance activities to be able to help his Government WT/COMTD/M/38 Page 8 identity its interests in the negotiations. That was something that had been acknowledged even by the Secretariat itself. Other agencies had to be actively involved in providing different perspectives and options so that delegations' positions could be based on an understanding of the various possibilities. One size fits all assistance and standardized products would have limited impact. That was why an intense cooperation with other agencies had to be included in the formulation of any WTO assistance programme. He noted the section devoted to the Integrated Framework and the reference made on page 4 to ""mainstreaming"" and asked for clarification on the practical implications of channelling assistance on trade negotiations through the IF and the precise meaning of the terms ""Mainstreaming"" and ""synergies""'. Those questions related to the role of the IF in trade negotiations. His delegation looked forward to receiving clear indications from the WTO Secretariat on the substantive content of the list of seminars and missions indicated in the Plan. They had to be explained in terms of objectives and modalities. He hoped that in the future, more attention would be paid to a balanced distribution of programmes.","WTCOMTDM38.pdf","Zambia, Members, WTO, WTO, WTO, Secretariat, WTO, WTO, Secretariat"

He went on to say that after the meeting of the CTD on 22 January 2002 which had been entirely devoted to Technical Cooperation and Training, the WTO Secretariat had prepared a revision of the Technical Cooperation Plan and an Agenda item on Technical Cooperation had therefore been included on the Agenda. The CTD would have normally elected its chairperson at the end of the first meeting of the year. However, the Chairman of the General Council was still in the process of holding consultations on the slate of officers for the different WTO bodies. As the CTD Chair could not be decided independently of the overall election of officers, the CTD would have to elect its chairperson for 2002 at its next regular session, scheduled for 23 April 2002 as the first substantial item on the agenda of that Meeting. He further suggested that the election of chairperson for the Sub- Committee on Least Developed Counties also be deferred to the following Meeting. He therefore proposed that Agenda Item C on the Election of Chairperson of the Committee on Trade and Development and Agenda Item E on the Election of Chairperson of the Sub-Committee on Least Developed Countries be postponed and put on the agenda of the next regular session.","WTCOMTDM38.pdf","CTD, WTO, Secretariat, CTD, Chairman, General, Council, WTO, CTD, Sub, -, Committee, on, Least, Developed, Counties, Chairperson, Committee, on, Trade, and, Development, and, Agenda, Item, E, Chairperson"

The representative of Cuba said that she was fully aware of the importance that Ministers at the Doha Ministerial Conference had attributed to technical assistance and capacity-building. It was referred to in over ten paragraphs in the Ministerial Declaration and it emphasised that technical assistance and capacity-building should be guaranteed and predictable. Her delegation urged the donors to make the necessary contributions so that a comprehensive plan could be carried out that satisfied the needs of all Members. Her delegation was satisfied with the coordination between the WTO and other specialized agencies, in particular with UNCTAD. That would avoid duplication of efforts and would be able to better tap available resources in other organizations. She approved of coordinated activities, particularly in dealing with the Singapore topics, as well as regarding the database. The database was of fundamental importance for developing countries so that they could better understand and hence be able to participate more fully in negotiations on market access. There was a need for greater coordination of efforts with UNCTAD with a view to derive more benefits from the resources available in that organization. Although technical assistance was not the solution to the problems which developing countries faced, it would clearly assist them in providing a better understanding of the different topics, many of which were relatively new.","WTCOMTDM38.pdf","Cuba, Doha, Ministerial, Conference, Members, WTO, UNCTAD, Singapore, UNCTAD"
"3814",3814,"18","18.     The representative of Japan said that his delegation wished to continue to consult with the Secretariat in order to make the Plan a better one. It was good that the Secretariat had already entered into consultation with other agencies in order to coordinate the efforts and share costs. His Government was studying ways to contribute to the Global Trust Fund, which he felt should also cover the technical assistance and capacity building activities on the so-called Singapore issues, especially on trade and investment. He believed that the document had been improved. It clearly showed a linkage between technical assistance activities and the Doha Development Agenda. However, there was room for the further improvement.","WTCOMTDM38.pdf","Japan, Secretariat, Secretariat, Global, Trust, Fund, Singapore, Doha, Development, Agenda"
"3813",3813,"17","17.      The representative of Venezuela said that the document corresponded to the variety of topics for negotiation mentioned in the Doha Ministerial Declaration for negotiations and future work. However, it concentrated more on traditional items of the commercial agenda and relatively few activities were devoted to the Singapore issues. The document enumerated many organizations that were going to cooperate in the activities, some of which were subregional. She said that complementarity with UNCTAD had not been mentioned in any of the activities being planned for Latin America. It was her understanding that the Technical Assistance Plan presented by UNCTAD’s Secretary-General, Mr. Ricupero, referred to cooperation with other bodies, in particular with the WTO. Delegations wished to see more cooperation between agencies and it would therefore have been timely if the WTO assistance plan had foreseen joint activities with UNCTAD. Her delegation was convinced that the two institutions' somewhat different mandates would not give rise to                                                                                    WT/COMTD/M/38                                                                                            Page 7 duplication of efforts and would benefit Members. On several occasions the WTO technical assistance activities in the Andean countries and in Venezuela had been prepared jointly with UNCTAD and had given rise to excellent results. It was important that that positive experience of cooperation, which her delegation understood to be also true for Africa, be repeated in the Latin American region. There should be more cooperation between UNCTAD and the WTO in the activities foreseen at the regional level in the areas of services, agriculture, environment and the new issues. She sought clarification on the implications of paragraph 2.2 of the document which refered to the efficient coordination of technical assistance with multilateral agencies and the consequences of the word synergy in that context. She asked whether the technical assistance resources being earmarked for joint activities with UNCTAD could be requested by individual delegations also. With regard the list of activities she said that it was necessary to consult with the Members before defining the programmes and the topics, as stated in paragraph 3(iii) of the Secretariat’s document. It was also important that countries participated in the organization of the activities so as to better reflect the interests and the needs of each country.","WTCOMTDM38.pdf","Venezuela, Singapore, UNCTAD, Latin, America, UNCTAD, Ricupero, WTO, WTO, UNCTAD, Page, 7, Members, WTO, Venezuela, UNCTAD, Africa, UNCTAD, WTO, UNCTAD, Members, Secretariat"

"3811",3811,"15","15.     He went on to say that the figures were consistent with the earlier estimate of the need for approximately CHF 15 million in contributions for use in 2002. However, since the General Council had agreed on the CHF 15 million level for the Doha Development Agenda Global Trust Fund, a number of additional activities had been identified and costed. Most of those activities were described in Annex 1 to WT/COMTD/W/95/Rev.1. The additional activities and their estimated costs were the following. First, there were future activities of the WTO Training Institute which had not been covered by the regular budget in 2002 and those activities would require around CHF 300,000. Secondly, there was technical assistance relating to trade and investment where there was an additional amount contributed to the project of CHF 1.8 million expected from UNCTAD. The share due to the WTO was based on what was in Annex 1 and was about 2 million Swiss francs in 2002. The third category of additional expenses related to technical assistance with regard to trade and competition policy and amounted to CHF 250,000 for the year 2002. Finally there were CHF 331,500 of programme support funds associated with that extra Annex 1 activity so that the consolidated total that would be reached with the Annex 1 activities would be an additional CHF 2,881,5000. It was estimated that all the projects taken together would involve a cost to the WTO, over and above the regular budget available for technical cooperation, of about CHF 16.3 million. About 19 per cent of that amount would be devoted to national activities, about 76 per cent to regional activities and the remainder to expenses on the tools which were identified in Section 6 of WT/COMTD/W/95/Rev.1. The Secretariat wished to see pledges to the Doha Development Agenda Global Trust Fund in 2002 for about CHF 16.3 million and reminded delegations that the Secretariat would be covering a considerable amount of WTO staff technical-assistance related travel through CHF 1.5 million provided for the regular budget for that purpose.","WTCOMTDM38.pdf","General, Council, Doha, Development, Agenda, Global, Trust, Fund, WTO, Training, Institute, UNCTAD, WTO, WTO, Secretariat, Secretariat, WTO"

Deputy Director-General Mr. Andrew Stoler addressed the second of the questions, informing Members of developments related to the costing of the Plan, notably in light of the Pledging Conference. He hoped that the figures, taken together with the details provided to delegations in documents related to the Coordinated Annual Plan and its Annex 1, would provide Members with basic information that they needed to prepare their authorities' positions in advance of the Pledging Conference for the Doha Development Agenda Global Trust Fund. He began with the costing of the activities that were covered by the 2002 Plan. Nearly all of the activities were known to the Secretariat when they prepared the estimates that were used to arrive at the CHF 15 million figure WT/COMTD/M/38 Page 6 which had subsequently been agreed by Members as the target for the 2002 Doha Development Agenda Global Trust Fund. The costing that had been arrived at for those activities in 2002 based on the 456 activities in the Plan and came to approximately CHF 14.9 million. The costing was arrived at by taking the following elements into account. First the estimated costs of the activities themselves was about CHF 16.1 million. That amount had then been reduced on account of cost sharing arrangements with other intergovernmental organizations that the WTO Secretariat anticipated arriving at, in particular, with respect to the regional activities. The reduction in the cost because of this to the WTO came to about CHF 2.9 million. In addition, the programme support fund cost of CHF 1.7 million had to be added. The consolidated total cost then came to CHF 14,886,376. In arriving at those figures the Secretariat had applied standard costing methodologies assigning different standard costs for a one day of activity for one person, depending upon whether the activity was classed as a regional activity, a national activity or a miscellaneous activity taking place in Geneva with the last one actually being the most expensive because it usually implied bringing in speakers and participants from outside of Geneva.","WTCOMTDM38.pdf","Director-General, Andrew, Stoler, Members, Members, Doha, Development, Agenda, Global, Trust, Fund, Secretariat, Members, Doha, Development, Agenda, Global, Trust, Fund, WTO, Secretariat, WTO, Secretariat, Geneva, Geneva"

"3782",3782,"12","12.       He continued by saying that there were two broad questions to address. First, the question of the implementation of the Plan, and second, the question of how much it would cost. In response to the first question he had seven specific remarks:         (a)     The implementation of the Secretariat-wide Plan for 2002 had began on                 1 January 2002. The CTD had taken note of the Technical Assistance Plan                 (document WT/COMTD/W/95) at its last meeting on 22 January 2002. The                 operational activities were being implemented on the basis of the New Strategy which                 had been welcomed and endorsed by Ministers in paragraph 38 of the Doha                 Ministerial Declaration. Implementation of the Plan had been preceded by                 exhaustive, bilateral and plurilateral consultations between the Secretariat and the                 Members, and the Secretariat remained in continuous dialogue with Members and                 welcomed the advice it was receiving WT/COMTD/M/38 Page 4      (b)   Second, and linked to implementation was the fact that over the past six weeks more            than 30 activities had been executed. It was to be noted, that planned activities in            several cases had to be postponed, some at the request of the beneficiary country            concerned and others, in order to be able to respond to emergency ad hoc missions            related to notifications to be executed within a mandatory time-frame. Officials in            the Technical Cooperation Division were in contact with delegations in the regions of            their responsibility in order to identify definite dates and venues for execution of the            planned activities. The rate of implementation was and equally dependent on the            beneficiary countries as the Secretariat and providers of assistance.      (c)   Third, the Revision of the Plan contained in document WT/COMTD/W/95/Rev.1. had            been issued to respond to Members' comments and observations during the last            meeting. The Secretariat would issue revisions to the Plan when even necessary.            These were transitional years for WTO Technical Cooperation and the Secretariat            continued to explore optimal strategies for how to best respond to the new and            unprecedented development agenda established at Doha Ministerial Conference. The            Secretariat's approach was stated in paragraph 2 of the Plan and the Secretariat would            continue to be guided by superior advice, which commanded consensus.      (d)   Fourth, Members would certainly agree with the dynamic and evolving nature of the            Plan. He insisted that both the Plan and its implementation were work in progress.            That would ensure that it met the needs of both providers of resources and of            beneficiaries. Since the last meeting, the Secretariat had consulted with several            regional and subregional groupings, such as CARICOM in order to fine tune and            focus the Plan more precisely around the needs of the beneficiaries. The Secretariat            expressed its appreciation to the CARICOM Group for their positive and constructive            suggestions on the fine tuning of the Plan to better respond to the needs of the Latin            American and Caribbean region.      (e)   Fifth, consultations had been held or were in progress with multilateral agencies to            identify the complementary contributions that they could make. On 25 January 2002            the Secretariat had held interagency consultations with the World Bank, OECD and            UNCTAD. The purpose of those had been to develop enhanced interagency            co-operation on technical cooperation and capacity-building in the field of            competition policy, to explain the Doha mandate to other agencies in that regard, and            to seek their support and cooperation in its fulfilment. The Secretariat had exchanged            experiences on the best way of meeting the needs of developing countries.            Discussions on each organization's specific technical cooperation plans had led to the            identification of specific opportunities for cooperation and coordination among the            organizations. The inter-agency meeting was considered successful by the            participating agencies. The invited agencies had underlined their support for            enhanced cooperation to meet the requirements of the Doha Ministerial Declaration.            The Secretariat had been able to identify complementarities between the types of            technical assistance provided by the different organizations, and advantage would be            taken of that complementarity. A significant number of specific possibilities for            cooperation in the form of joint activities, mutual support for each others activities,            and coordinated activities had been identified, especially with UNCTAD. It had also            been agreed that interagency cooperation had to be viewed as an ongoing process and            that representatives of the various organizations would remain in contact with each            other on a regular basis to exchange information on coming events. The Secretariat            was in the process of following-up with each of the organizations to work out the            practical details. Further information on capacity-building for trade and competition            policy in accordance with the objectives set out in Annex 1 of the Plan would be                                                                                   WT/COMTD/M/38                                                                                           Page 5                 provided at the informal meeting of the Working Group on the Interaction Between                 Trade and Competition Policy on 26 February 2002. The second example was of the                 Working Group on Trade and Investment which had already held an informal                 meeting to examine the issue of technical assistance and capacity-building in its                 specific area with the substantive participation of the UNCTAD Secretariat. More                 information would be provided as soon as possible on consultations with UNCTAD                 in that regard. The third example was that the Secretariat had convened a meeting                 with several agencies and the key providers of technical assistance on                 19 February 2002 to define the structure, parameters and categories for the WTO                 Technical Assistance Database that would be used to provide information to                 Members on trade-related technical assistance activities by beneficiary countries and                 by donor countries in accordance with the Doha Ministerial mandate. More                 information would be provided by the Secretariat at a subsequent meeting of the                 CTD. Finally, the Director-General had convened a meeting of Integrated                 Framework Heads of Agencies in Washington on 26 February 2002, which would be                 hosted by Mr. Wolfensohn, the President of the World Bank. The WTO Director-                 General would host a joint meeting of the WTO African Group and the Least-                 Developed Countries Consultative Group on 19 February 2002 to seek their advice in                 advance of the IF heads of Agencies meeting. The Heads of Agency meeting would                 focus inter alia on the implementation of the IF pilot scheme and its extension to                 other countries. A report would be made to the Sub-Committee on Least-Developed                 Countries after that meeting.         (f)     The Pledging Conference for the Doha Developmental Agenda Trust Fund had been                 scheduled for 11 March 2002. He hoped to have Ministerial participation at that                 event and mentioned that invitations had been circulated to all Members. He said that                 the Secretariat appealed to donors and invited agencies to ensure that the Pledging                 Conference would be a success. Success would maintain the post-Doha momentum                 on the central issue of Technical Cooperation and Capacity-Building.         (g)     He emphasized that the Annual Plan could not respond to all the needs of the                 beneficiary countries. The Plan was only one out of five basic elements in the overall                 architecture for responding to the Doha Mandate on Technical Cooperation and                 Capacity-Building.","WTCOMTDM38.pdf","CTD, Secretariat, Members, Secretariat, Members, Technical, Cooperation, Division, Secretariat, Members, Secretariat, WTO, Technical, Cooperation, Secretariat, Doha, Ministerial, Conference, Secretariat, Secretariat, Members, Secretariat, CARICOM, Secretariat, CARICOM, Group, Caribbean, Secretariat, World, Bank, OECD, UNCTAD, Doha, Secretariat, Secretariat, UNCTAD, Secretariat, Working, Group, Working, Group, on, Trade, and, Investment, Secretariat, UNCTAD, Secretariat, WTO, Technical, Assistance, Database, Members, Doha, Secretariat, CTD, Director-General, Integrated, Framework, Heads, of, Agencies, Washington, Wolfensohn, World, Bank, WTO, Director, WTO, African, Group, Least, -, Developed, Countries, Consultative, Group, Doha, Developmental, Agenda, Trust, Fund, Members, Secretariat"

The Trade Negotiating Committee had agreed, on 1 February 2002, that the work on special and differential treatment stemming from the Doha Ministerial Meeting should be carried out in Special Sessions of the Committee on Trade and Development (CTD). The issue of special and differential treatment had therefore been taken off the agenda of the regular session of the CTD. An invitation to a Special Session following the Regular Session of the Committee had been sent out after that decision on the assumption that a Chairman for the Special Session would have been selected in the General Council. In the absence of a General Council decision on chairs the Chairman had consulted informally. The Special Session would therefore be postponed until a chairperson had been elected. An invitation to a Special Session of the CTD would be issued as soon as practicable.","WTCOMTDM38.pdf","Chairman, Trade, Negotiating, Committee, Committee, on, Trade, and, Development, CTD, Committee, Chairman, General, Council, General, Council, Chairman, CTD"

He contributed by saying that there was a system of evaluation that had been described in the document WT/COMTD/W/86/Add.1 which had been provided to the CTD in the year 2001. A system for evaluation existed since many years, but it had been updated for the longer Trade Policy Courses. The evaluation method had lately been adapted to other activities of the Institute. For each activity there was thus a quite elaborated evaluation mechanism regarding aspects such as the degree of knowledge transferred, as experienced by the participants, and the efficiency of the experts making the presentations. All aspects were included in the evaluation. The Training Institute was also in the process of studying how the evaluation method could be adapted to suit some of the new activities as they would be different, such as the distance learning courses or the training of trainers. Another area of monitoring that the Training Institute would be interested in, but which it could not undertake for reasons of sovereignty of WTO Members over their internal affairs, was to look at what happened to the students trained once they returned to their countries. However, there were indirect methods to verify what had happened. For example, a fact that was readily verifiable was that an increasing number of Geneva-based delegates from developing countries were former participants of the Trade Policy Course. More than eighty former Trade Policy Course participants were currently in Geneva and among those a number of ambassadors. Through contacts with capitals it was also known that a number of former Trade Policy Course participants worked as trade-policy experts in capitals. That was an indirect way of measuring the impact of the courses. However, he hoped for future methods of analysis and evaluation in capitals with the help of the governments, which would permit to measure the exact impact of the courses.","WTCOMTDM37.pdf","CTD, Institute, Training, Institute, Training, Institute, WTO, Members, Geneva, Trade, Policy, Course"

"3748",3748,"79","79.      He further said that concerning the selection process for the courses, all the beneficiary countries were aware of the criteria as they were published each time an invitation was sent. Those criteria were public and concerned age, education, language skills in the language of the course, work experience in the area of trade policy and, a criterion on which the Training Institute insisted strongly, whether the candidates would, upon completion of the course, return to their respective Ministries and actually work with WTO-related issues. The selection was carried out at two levels; at the level of the Training Institute and at the Senior Management level of the WTO Secretariat. There were also a number of other criteria. For example, the aim was to have some regional distribution in order for the participants in each group to benefit from each others' experiences. Female representation was another consideration. There were no specific percentages but when there were many applicants, women were well represented. Since 1997 there was a mandate to give LDCs special attention. That priority was always taken into account, although it was difficult to achieve in the Spanish-speaking courses as there were not many Spanish-speaking LDC applicants. However, there was a tendency for a greater and greater regional representation in all courses. Countries which previously only made requests to attend French-speaking courses had made requests for courses held in English and Spanish, and vice-versa, so there seemed to be a certain mobility.","WTCOMTDM37.pdf","Training, Institute, Training, Institute, WTO, Secretariat"
"3747",3747,"78","78.      The Director of the Training Institute said that he would begin by the last question. The Training Institute currently had enough resources to carry out its activities with the exception, which was mentioned in the table of the document, of the second phase of the training-of-trainers programme. Otherwise, the financial resources seemed to be sufficient to cover the activities mentioned in the document. However, in order to increase the activities of the Training Institute in the future, increased resources would have to be made available. The mandate received in June 2001 had begun to be implemented. Most of the second part of last year had been devoted to preparation for the activities which were new to the Training Institute as well and to prepare the ground for pilot projects and other activities which could be implemented. There was therefore always a need for additional funding, but for projects yet to be defined. There was another activity which lacked funding relating to contacts with academia in developing countries. The Training Institute would, in the weeks to come, work on defining certain projects and contact donors. With respect to courses in French he said that he wished to draw the delegations' attention to footnote 11 on page 8. The Training Institute found itself in a difficult situation as it could not begin to double the courses straight away. First, there was a need for an additional training room for a new set of students. He hoped that                                                                                      WT/COMTD/M/37                                                                                             Page 25 this room would be ready by the end of August 2002 and it would then be possible to give two courses in parallel which would begin the cycle of double courses. The doubling would only be finalized in 2003 when the first 6 courses would have been held and it was in the beginning of 2003 that the course in French would be held. For every cycle, there would be four courses in English, one each in French and Spanish, which corresponded quite closely to the demand for fellowships in each language. The dates were not wrong, as the plan was to hold two parallel courses. The aim was to carry out joint activities of the two groups as often as possible since the new room would allow for that. In the initial phase of preparations for the pilot schemes, the Training Institute had contacted all possible other agencies with experience in the field and had benefitted from extensive advice and collaboration. The same had applied to the phase of bidding for the providers of such services where the Training Institute had benefitted from several demonstrations of different programmes which had enabled them to better select the service provider.","WTCOMTDM37.pdf","Director, Training, Institute, Training, Institute, Training, Institute, Training, Institute, Training, Institute, Training, Institute, Training, Institute, Training, Institute"

"3742",3742,"73","73.      The representative of the European Communities said that it was his delegation's belief that the training activities were important to spread the knowledge of the WTO into wider circles. His delegation wished to make two points in that respect. First, the planned on-line activities were important and his delegation encouraged the Training Institute to consider what other Geneva-based agencies had done in that respect. He knew that WIPO and other agencies had done some good work which the WTO might learn from. The second was that his delegation encouraged the Training Institute to seek as much cooperation as possible with institutions which did already train people. From the experience of the European Communities he knew that there were numerous such institutions within the Communities which would be ready to cooperate. There were also more and more possible counterparts in developing countries which would be effective partners in delivering joint training activities.","WTCOMTDM37.pdf","European, Communities, WTO, Training, Institute, WIPO, WTO, Training, Institute"

The representative of India said that he was pleased to note that the activities of the Training Institute were being diversified with the introduction of a pilot project to offer distance-learning on line. In fact, in one of his delegation's earlier interactions with the Training Institute, such a course had been suggested. His delegation was therefore grateful to the WTO Secretariat for the introduction WT/COMTD/M/37 Page 24 of that new activity. He hoped that this would assist interested people in developing countries to benefit from an increased understanding of the WTO Agreements without having to come to Geneva. On the last page of the document, there seemed to be a mistake as the twenty-first and twenty-second Trade Policy Courses had both been given the same dates.","WTCOMTDM37.pdf","India, Training, Institute, Training, Institute, WTO, Secretariat, WTO, Geneva"

He went on to say that coherence and complementarity between the activities of the Training Institute and the technical cooperation programmes were one of the priorities of the Secretariat. The role of the Technical Assistance Management Committee, which he chaired, was to ensure the implementation of that priority. He also mentioned the future role of the Joint Consultative Board on WTO-related Training which encompassed representatives of UNCTAD, ITC, World Bank, universities and WTO Members through the Chairpersons of the WTO Committees directly concerned by development matters. One of the objectives of that Board was to ameliorate the cooperation between the organizations in the area of training. The Board had held its first meeting in November 2001. The Training Institute was already cooperating closely with a number of agencies which were active in the area of training.","WTCOMTDM37.pdf","Training, Institute, Secretariat, Technical, Assistance, Management, Committee, Joint, Consultative, Board, UNCTAD, ITC, World, Bank, WTO, Members, WTO, Committees, Board, Training, Institute"
"3739",3739,"70","70.      Deputy Director-General Mr. Ravier said that the relevant document had been issued under document symbol WT/COMTD/W/89/Rev.1. Members would recall that they had already been informed at the meeting of the Committee in October last year of the activities the Training Institute envisaged for the year 2002. The work programme of the Training Institute had been revised in order to take the decisions taken at the Doha Ministerial Conference and in Geneva, with the adoption of the 2002 budget, into account. Document WT/COMTD/W/89/Rev.1 complemented and specified the information provided to delegations last year. The activities of the Training Institute complemented those contained in the Technical Assistance Plan. That was also the reason why the documents were examined in parallel. He said that he was of the view that future discussions on WTO technical assistance should always be linked to a discussion on training as the two were inter-related. Members had, in the course of the discussion of the WTO budget, approved a doubling of the activities of the Training Institute. The doubling concerned essentially the three-month Trade Policy Courses. That increase would substantially increase the courses available to Members and especially to developing country Members. Even if it had not been foreseen that the doubling of the three-month courses would be fully operational before 2003 (for practical reasons), the training activities would increase during 2002 with visible results already during the second semester of 2002. Members had also decided, in the course of the December 2001 budget discussion, to regularly finance training activities which previously depended exclusively on extra-budgetary resources. That was particularly the case for the Short Trade-Policy Courses for LDCs which, during the last few years, had become a more or less regular training feature. Two of the new mandates given to the Training Institute at its creation in June 2001 were to be concretised during the first part of 2002, i.e. training of trainers and distance learning. First, training of trainers would be undertaken to increase the quality of the training given by Secretariat experts when they were asked to participate in training or technical cooperation activities. The second phase of the programme, which would start in the second half of the year 2002, was intended for developing country trainers. The first part would be financed through already existing voluntary extra-budgetary resources. The financing of the second part had still not been ensured but was currently being costed. He hoped that this responded to one of the questions raised in the earlier discussion on technical cooperation. The Training Institute was also supervising the preparatory work for the launching of a pilot project on distance learning through a training course on line for about 65 participants in developing countries. The pilot project, which was scheduled for mid 2002, would permit modifications to be made before the launching of a more ambitious distance-learning programme on which the Training Institute was currently working. A third sphere of activities concerned the relations with universities, in particular those in developing countries. That activity had recently not received much attention as it had not yet received the necessary financing to give it the desired content. However, he hoped that that situation would improve.","WTCOMTDM37.pdf","Director-General, Ravier, Members, Committee, Training, Institute, Training, Institute, Doha, Ministerial, Conference, Geneva, Training, Institute, WTO, Members, WTO, Training, Institute, Members, Members, Members, Training, Institute, Secretariat, Training, Institute, Training, Institute"

There was no use in planning activities which could not be financed. His delegation was of the view that it was important that an LDC unit be established within the Secretariat. He asked why the WTO did not use the example of WIPO and UNCTAD, which had centralized all issues relating to the LDCs in one place.","WTCOMTDM37.pdf","Djibouti, Director-General, Ouedraogo, WTO, Secretariat, Secretariat, WTO, WIPO, UNCTAD, LDCs"

"3732",3732,"64","64.      The representative of the European Communities said that his delegation was satisfied with the explanations given regarding the next steps. However, the revision had to be made before the holding of the Pledging Conference, as the basis for that Conference would be the Plan. He indicated that there would be some additional funding forthcoming. Regarding the suggestion to use the model of one donor country in the presentation of technical assistance, a clear definition of activities had to be found in order for different things not to be mixed. Only one model had been quoted but other models were available. The OECD for example was working on one. The forthcoming meeting of the Committee in February should contain a discussion on what happened to the WTO Technical Assistance Strategy and the concepts of demand-drivenness and ownership. A certain demand was defined through the Doha Ministerial Declaration which could help reconcile the idea of a strategy and operational activities. They were not completely separate and there was already a link. His delegation had noted the point that the delegation of India had a different view of what had been done in paragraph 20 of the Doha Ministerial Declaration regarding agreed negotiations in the Annex on Investment and Singapore issues. However, his delegation did not want the issue to go the other way in the sense that other delegations would ask for the insertion of the language ""to be"" agreed negotiations. The best way out was to leave that discussion to the General Council and the Trade Negotiations Committee and only to refer to the paragraphs where there was full agreement that technical assistance should take place, such as paragraph 21 with respect to investment. There was no need for that issue to hold up the work on technical assistance in the CTD.","WTCOMTDM37.pdf","European, Communities, OECD, Committee, WTO, Technical, Assistance, Strategy, India, Singapore, General, Council, Trade, Negotiations, Committee, CTD"

The representative of Zambia said that his delegation would also be submitting a paper containing specific comments on the Plan and he said that he hoped that the Secretariat would take those into account in the revised Plan. The Doha Ministerial Declaration had made specific reference to the LDCs. He wondered why some non-LDCs would receive as many as eight missions compared to only one mission to many LDCs when the WTO Technical Cooperation Strategy stated that although technical cooperation was for all developing countries, Members had asked that LDCs be given priority. There was thus no consistency between the Strategy and the Plan. In addition, the WT/COMTD/M/37 Page 22 Integrated Framework Pilot Scheme focussed on three countries. He asked what would happen to the LDCs which were not included in the Pilot Scheme as it was stated in the Plan that the Pilot countries would be used as a basis. On the macro-level it was important that there was a specific section or unit in the WTO Secretariat which dealt with LDCs. A unit had been established after the Seattle Ministerial Conference but it had recently disappeared.

"3730",3730,"62","62.      The representative of the United States said that her delegation had understood that the Committee would ""take note"" of the Plan. Her delegation supported the overall initiative of the Plan and was actively engaged on a number of levels, including through a contribution to the new Global Trust Fund as had been announced by her the Minister of Trade. She would have made a number of statements with respect to possible improvements to the Plan that her delegation wished other delegations to be aware of. However, as the Plan would be revised, her delegation would shortly circulate a non-paper containing suggestions for improvements. One such change would be the reference in Section VI concerning tools for development. Her government was a supporter of the increased use of information technology, especially in technical assistance. However, her delegation had concerns regarding the information technology element and wished to review it further. She said that she hoped that the Secretariat would take her delegations comments into account in the revised draft Plan. There was a need to gear particular programmes towards a particular result. Her delegation had noted the comments made by a number of delegations including St Lucia and Zambia regarding the necessity to balance the attention given to different regions in particular need of technical assistance.","WTCOMTDM37.pdf","United, States, Committee, Secretariat, St, Lucia, Zambia"
"3729",3729,"61","61.      His third comment related to the JITAP. The JITAP would be evaluated. There had been 27 demands from LDCs and other African countries to benefit from the JITAP programme as it had led to concrete results. He said that he hoped that donors would keep that in mind. There was a complementarity between the JITAP and the Integrated Framework. He said that one example was a sub-regional workshop that he himself had attended in west Africa. The participating countries of that workshop had positive impressions of JITAP. There was no contradiction. Both the JITAP and the Integrated Framework aimed at building capacity in developing countries. Developing countries represented over 80 per cent of the WTO Membership and capacity building was one means of assisting those countries to participate more actively in world trade.","WTCOMTDM37.pdf","Integrated, Framework, Africa, JITAP, Integrated, Framework, WTO"
"3728",3728,"60","60.      Deputy Director-General Mr. Ouedraogo said that in his capacity as Deputy Director-General in charge of the CTD he wished to make one comment and the observations. The Plan represented a large effort to rationalize the WTO technical cooperation activities and contribute rigour and discipline to their implementation. That should assure the donors and give a new boost to technical assistance. He said that the first observation he wished to make related to the fact that he had recently returned from New York where he had participated in the proceedings of the Preparatory Committee for the International Conference on Financing for Development. At the opening of those proceedings, the Secretary-General of the United Nations had said that ""what was essential in every programming exercise was to make decisions that could be implemented"". WTO technical cooperation was important for developing countries, and it was therefore important that the financing of it was assured. Donors present in the CTD had proposed changes to the Plan and he hoped that, with those changes incorporated, financing would be forthcoming. The second observation related to the development dimension of the WTO. It was clear that the WTO contributed to development. That was, in fact, the reason why the outcome of the Doha Ministerial Meeting was called the Doha Development Agenda. That was also one of the reasons why the Secretary-General of the Untied Nations had called on the WTO to be one of the major institutional stakeholders of the International Conference on Financing for Development to be held in Monterrey, Mexico in March. The WTO did not finance development in the sense that it did not finance such things as infrastructure in developing countries. It was through its technical assistance programme that the WTO contributed.","WTCOMTDM37.pdf","Director-General, Ouedraogo, Director-General, CTD, WTO, New, York, Preparatory, Committee, United, Nations, WTO, CTD, WTO, WTO, Doha, Development, Agenda, WTO, Monterrey, Mexico, WTO, WTO"

"3726",3726,"59","59.      He continued by addressing the micro issues. There was an omission in the Plan of an NGO symposium. On page 15 there was an activity related to a symposium involving NGOs on trade and environment. However, there would be another NGO symposium on a broader topic which would be included in the revision of the Plan. A couple of questions had been raised with respect to the ""Geneva Week"" activity. Two ""Geneva Weeks"" were planned for April and October 2002 and they could be found on page 14. The Secretariat was guided by the wish of Members that meetings of the Sub-Committee and the Committee of Trade and Development should be scheduled during those weeks in order to allow representatives from headquarters to participate. Several questions with respect to the JITAP had been raised. The JITAP was designed to terminate in June 2002. The terminal evaluation would begin in February 2002. Approximately 30 applications had been received from individual African countries to have the benefits of the JITAP extended to them. The major providers of the JITAP funds had insisted that the JITAP be reconciled with the Integrated Framework in order not to have too many trust-funds operating indiscriminately and to build synergies. It was therefore necessary to wait for the terminal evaluation before any decision on an extension could be taken. The review of the Integrated Framework, initially scheduled for February 2002, would be held in the form of a seminar in April, after the meeting of trade and development ministers. He said he wished to draw these facts to the attention of delegations as he, at this stage, could not give any more precise answers to the questions. A concrete proposal should be before the CTD before the end of June 2002. Several delegations had mentioned that they wished the WTO Secretariat to distribute the venues for its regional seminars to more countries. It was a question that the Secretariat was looking into. Decisions on the venue was made jointly by the WTO and the regional economic commissions, the regional development banks or the headquarters of the regional institution that the WTO Secretariat was dealing with. There were frequently political and social factors which had to be taken into account in choosing the location. The language with respect to ""agreed negotiations"" in Annex 1 would be clarified as requested by the representative of India. Regarding mainstreaming he said that the language of paragraph 38 of the Doha Ministerial Declaration was clear. However, Members had differing views on how it should be done, through the multilateral intervention of the agencies or through the multilateral agencies providing assistance to countries. There could be a compromise in unanimity in the CTD in that WTO technical assistance should be delivered within a coherent policy framework, not as a conditionality. That policy framework could either be the country Plan or their sovereign determined Poverty Reduction Strategy Papers. For every region there would be a regional seminar on mainstreaming. There had been a question on the distinction between seminars, conferences and capacity building. The WTO Secretariat was using the literal English language usage. The Secretariat would produce a revision which would seek to accommodate the views and priorities expressed by Members.                                                                                     WT/COMTD/M/37                                                                                            Page 21","WTCOMTDM37.pdf","Secretariat, Members, Committee, of, Trade, and, Development, Integrated, Framework, Integrated, Framework, CTD, WTO, Secretariat, Secretariat, WTO, WTO, Secretariat, India, Members, CTD, WTO, WTO, Secretariat, Secretariat, Members"
"3725",3725,"58","58.      With respect to costing he said that the formula applied by the WTO Secretariat (Administration and General Services Division) was the standard cost formula which required criteria such as the venue, the number of participants, a comparison of grey-market tickets with regular costs of passengers. This formula could not be applied too far in advance as all the parameters would then not be fixed. That was one of the reasons why the WTO Secretariat could not give a fixed costing of each activity to be carried out in the year 2002 already in January. Nevertheless, every activity would be individually costed. There had also been a question as to whether there had been any contributions to the Doha Development Agenda Global Trust Fund. The Trust Fund had been established and the WT/COMTD/M/37 Page 20 delegation of the United States had pledged a contribution of USD 1 million the previous day. He believed that contributions would grow, based on indications he had received at the meeting with the OECD-DAC. He said that there seemed to be unanimity with respect to the establishment of a database on trade-related technical assistance which would show the assistance delivered, not only by the WTO Secretariat, but by major providers of trade-related technical assistance. The Technical Cooperation Division had established the position of a Web-site manager but needed more assistance. The delegation of the United States had indicated that they would assist the WTO Secretariat in that regard. The delegation of the United States to the OECD-DAC had, at the Paris meeting, presented a recently established database by USAID and USTR on trade-related technical assistance provided by the United States. That database could provide an operating model for a larger database. The WTO Secretariat had therefore asked the United States delegation if it could send its consultant to the WTO Technical Cooperation Management Committee and if the WTO Secretariat could then build on that model. It was important to quickly put up that database as it would provide valuable information for beneficiary countries on what was available as well as what was being done. The database would also help show what technical assistance could be provided in the short term (the coming year) and what could be done later, as well as provide a picture of what the WTO Secretariat was doing and what was done by other agencies and bilateral donors.","WTCOMTDM37.pdf","WTO, Secretariat, -LRB-, Administration, General, Services, Division, WTO, Secretariat, Doha, Development, Agenda, Global, Trust, Fund, Trust, Fund, United, States, WTO, Secretariat, Technical, Cooperation, Division, United, States, WTO, Secretariat, United, States, Paris, USAID, USTR, United, States, WTO, Secretariat, United, States, WTO, Technical, Cooperation, Management, Committee, WTO, Secretariat, WTO, Secretariat"
"3724",3724,"57","57.     He went on to say that evaluation and monitoring was an area of priority where the WTO Secretariat had to improve although some improvements had already been made. The Technical Cooperation Division had originally been monitoring itself. A separate audit within the Secretariat had subsequently been established under Mr. Paul Rolian who worked together with a consultant. The Technical Cooperation Division believed that an external audit should, periodically, be used. Currently, there were two forms for evaluation for every technical cooperation activity. One form was given to the beneficiary host country authority which it had to send back directly to the WTO Secretariat (to the technical cooperation audit) without the person delivering the technical cooperation seeing it. Mr. Rolian's reports then went to senior management as well as to the Technical Cooperation Management Committee. A report on monitoring and evaluation would also go to the CTD in order for Members to better appreciate the evolution of the quality of the technical cooperation delivered.","WTCOMTDM37.pdf","WTO, Secretariat, Technical, Cooperation, Division, Secretariat, Paul, Rolian, WTO, Secretariat, Rolian, Technical, Cooperation, Management, Committee, CTD, Members"
"3723",3723,"56","56.      He further said that several delegations had asked for clarification on the issue of coordination. All parties involved in technical cooperation had to improve coordination. The Plan was not a Technical Cooperation Division document.                       The Director-General and Deputy Director-General had ensured that the Plan was composed of activities jointly designed with all operational divisions within the Secretariat. Cooperation within the WTO Secretariat had been ensured through the Technical Cooperation Management Committee (TAMC). Coordination with other agencies was approached at two levels. One level was through the Integrated Framework which focussed specifically on the LDCs. There had been voices for the Integrated Framework concept to be extended to non-LDCs. That did not mean extending the Integrated Framework proper to other countries, but to apply the same coordinated approach to other developing countries that so wished. The WTO Secretariat was decided on that course of action, but WTO Members would have to press for the same change in the other agencies involved. This could encourage the agencies to establish another form of coordination mechanism. The WTO Secretariat aimed to improve coordination with donors, as one part of the coordination problem lay with the donors. There had been the first ever joint meeting of the six core agencies of the Integrated Framework and the OECD Development Assistance Committee in Paris the previous week. Coordination had been paramount. The point had then been made that trade and development ministers had to work more closely together and had to send out clear, consistent and coherent messages. At another level, coordination also had to be improved with the beneficiaries. The WTO Secretariat did not only receive requests for technical cooperation from the permanent missions in Geneva, a flurry of requests was also received from capitals. He had urged developing country missions, in bilateral discussions, to coordinate at their level as well so that the WTO Secretariat did not receive contradictory lists of requests from the same developing country Member. A specific question related to how the WTO Secretariat coordinated with UNCTAD with regard to the mandate of the trade and investment work programme. Mr. Richard Eglin, Director of the WTO Trade and Finance Division, had been in touch with the UNCTAD Secretariat. The WTO Secretariat would hardly organize any regional seminar on trade and investment under the Doha Mandate on investment. Rather, it would work within the framework of the regional seminars to be organized by UNCTAD. Annex I showed that the WTO Secretariat would convene a meeting of agencies on each of the Singapore issues to decide how to coordinate. Another example was that the WTO Secretariat would organize a meeting on trade and competition with the other agencies to discuss coordination already the coming Friday.","WTCOMTDM37.pdf","Director-General, Director-General, Secretariat, WTO, Secretariat, Technical, Cooperation, Management, Committee, Integrated, Framework, WTO, Secretariat, WTO, Members, WTO, Secretariat, Integrated, Framework, OECD, Development, Assistance, Committee, Paris, WTO, Secretariat, Geneva, WTO, Secretariat, Member, WTO, Secretariat, UNCTAD, Richard, Eglin, Director, WTO, Trade, and, Finance, Division, Secretariat, WTO, Secretariat, UNCTAD, WTO, Secretariat, Singapore, WTO, Secretariat"
"3722",3722,"55","55.      He said he wished to begin with the first category relating to general comments and advice. Members would recall that the CTD had established a consensus in 1996 that WTO technical assistance would be demand-driven. That had been stated in the guidelines which had gone to the Ministerial Conference in Singapore and which had been forwarded from the CTD by the then Chairperson Ambassador Benjelloun-Touimi. It was currently realized that the Secretariat could do better. The demand-driven approach had led to a long list of needs often exceeding the capacity of the Secretariat to deliver. It was therefore evident that that consensus had to be modified. The number of ad-hoc demands were growing, but they had to be reduced. Even though it was stated in the Plan, and some Members seemed to agree, that ad-hoc requests should be limited, there had still been many other Members reserving their right to come back with ad-hoc requests. That was an unsustainable situation. The Secretariat had aimed to strike the right balance, but it was for the Members to re-establish the indispensable new consensus to reconcile the growing number of individual country requests with the thematic and mandate-based orientation of technical cooperation that Members had said that they wanted. With respect to the presentational format he said that the current Plan contained a table of contents on the front page and an Annex at the end which gave the number of planned activities per region. It seemed that Members wished the Secretariat to include a new category which would present the technical cooperation mandates from the Doha Ministerial Declaration. It was possible to present the information in that way and the Secretariat would do so in the form of an Annex in a subsequent revision of the document. There were eleven paragraphs in the Doha Ministerial Declaration which contained operative technical cooperation mandates. Those paragraphs would be described and the 428 activities would then be classified accordingly. One delegation had expressed concern that the activities in the Plan seemed to be a simple listing. However, the Plan was based on the Strategy and activities had to be categorized somehow: they could be listed by region, areas of agreed negotiations, areas of work programmes or areas of mandates.

"3721",3721,"54","54.      Mr. Osakwe said that he had found all comments encouraging as they showed that the Membership supported what the Secretariat did in attempting to reconcile many divergent elements. He expressed particular appreciation to the delegations of Uruguay, Switzerland and others who had mentioned that they had appreciated the private consultations held by the Secretariat with respect to the Plan. At those consultations the Secretariat had attempted to explain to each group how their priorities had been taken into account and where they had differences of view with other stakeholders with particular interests. He was pleased to hear that several delegations had appreciated such consultations and encouraged the Secretariat to continue with them. The Plan contained operational activities. However, the discussion had focussed both on a technical cooperation strategy and on the operational activities in the Plan. It was a good occasion to comment on the broader Strategy which had to be revisited in light of the Doha Ministerial Declaration. Nevertheless, it had to be clear that, in spite of the interlinkages, there was a distinction between the Strategy and the Plan, which contained the operational activities based on mandates and decisions already taken by Members. Four types of comments had been made. First, Members had made general comments and given advice. Those would be taken into account. Second, Members had made comments regarding the presentational format of the Plan. Some of those comments had been contradictory and the Secretariat would have to seek more guidance from Members regarding the format. Nevertheless, he was confident that it could be improved. A third category was comments made at the macro-level such as those regarding coordination, regional groups, and a database. He would mention the intentions of the Secretariat in those respects. Last, there had been a number of comments on the micro level which the Secretariat should take into account.","WTCOMTDM37.pdf","Osakwe, Secretariat, Uruguay, Switzerland, Secretariat, Secretariat, Secretariat, Members, Members, Members, Secretariat, Members, Secretariat, Secretariat"
"3720",3720,"53","53.      Deputy Director-General Mr. Ravier said that three categories of issues merited attention. The first category was the procedural issues, and it was up to delegations to decide whether they wished to simply take note of the Plan or to do something more formal. He personally thought that the idea of the document, which could be improved, was that it be taken note of. The second category of issues meriting attention was the link between the Plan and the Doha Ministerial Declaration. Many delegations had mentioned that it was necessary to clarify the link between the capacity building efforts mentioned in the Plan and the Doha Development Agenda. That proposal merited consideration and it would be possible to make that link without any major change to the Plan in its current form. The Plan would have to be structured somewhat differently in order to show what related directly to the Doha Development Agenda and what came from the regular WTO work on technical assistance. Even if the Doha Ministerial Declaration was the politically most visible WT/COMTD/M/37 Page 18 document, WTO technical assistance activities also covered sectors which were not mentioned in the Declaration. The third category related to specific comments on different aspects of the Plan and he would give the floor to the Director of the Technical Cooperation Division to respond to those.","WTCOMTDM37.pdf","Director-General, Ravier, Doha, Development, Agenda, Doha, Development, Agenda, WTO, WTO, Director, Technical, Cooperation, Division"

He believed that technical assistance should be linked to the Doha Development Agenda, which in turn should be linked to all the activities of the WTO and its different Agreements. Technical assistance within the WTO should take into consideration the greater creation of supply in developing countries. He said that he was happy to see that his country was included in the 2002 Plan with the workshop on safeguards. He had also taken note of the comments made, that the Plan would be applied throughout the year, although it might be adjusted in the future, as the Programme evolved and as changes were introduced according to the needs of the WTO Members.","WTCOMTDM37.pdf","Mexico, Doha, Development, Agenda, WTO, WTO, WTO, Members"
"3717",3717,"50","50.      The representative of Bulgaria said that with respect to the organisation of the seminars, he proposed that all basic documents and presentations from each seminar, symposium and round-table, whether at the regional or national level, for Geneva-based Missions or non-resident Members, be made available to all Members. An additional link on the WTO web page could be developed, where all those documents could be posted. That would allow all countries to have access to the documents, and it would facilitate him advising experts from his capital to source those materials. It was pointed out that UNCTAD was doing something similar with respect to the outcome of its Expert Meetings, and they might be able to explain how that was organised. That would also reduce rivalry within the WTO with respect to technical assistance, as it would not matter whether a session was held for LDCs or a specific region, as all Members would have access to the basic documents and presentations in written format.","WTCOMTDM37.pdf","Bulgaria, Members, Members, WTO, UNCTAD, WTO, Members"

"3715",3715,"49","49.      The representative of St. Lucia indicated that her intervention would be from the perspective of non-residents. Thirty per cent of the WTO Membership were non-resident Members. The circumstances of the non-residents therefore required some sensitivity by the other Members for the challenges they faced. She thanked the delegation of India for indicating that the WTO needed to keep non-residents informed. She was under the impression that the WTO had approved two Geneva Weeks in the General Council and in the Committee on Budget and Administration, but that had to be clarified. With respect to capacity building, many of the previous interventions had focused on the need for targeted technical assistance in line with Members' development strategies. Part of the problem, as stated in many of the interventions, was to focus on the specific requests from Members, which almost locked them into a vicious circle of ignorance. A certain level of understanding of the WTO Agreements was required to make a specific request for technical assistance. For instance, St. Lucia was the only member of the Organisation of Eastern Caribbean States (OECS) featured in the Plan for any technical missions. She noted that the assistance was to be delivered through regional seminars, workshops, conferences and briefings, and her delegation sought a clarification similar to that of the representative of Belize on the differences between those. In addition, the assistance was at                                                                                    WT/COMTD/M/37                                                                                           Page 17 the Caribbean Community (CARICOM) or broader hemispheric level. She thanked the Secretariat for holding two of the CARICOM seminars in St. Lucia, as it gave her Government the opportunity to have more persons present. However, the absence of more targeted technical assistance was disappointing. It might be said that the Governments also bore responsibility for the absence of any activity specifically targeted towards the sub-region as they had not been proactive enough. She was in the process of finding out what requests had been made by the OECS countries, and at what level – whether regional, sub-regional or national. There were reasons why all six OECS Members, and other CARICOM Members, were non-resident. As small-island states with populations between 40,000 and 150,000 persons, the OECS countries had over-burdened administrations and often an insufficient understanding of the Uruguay Round obligations to appreciate their deficiencies, in order to make timely technical assistance requests. She therefore hoped that, as stated by the delegations of Madagascar, Lesotho and Jamaica, among others, the door remained opened for ad hoc technical assistance requests, and asked the Secretariat to be creative in the design and delivery of programmed assistance, and to use every occasion to reach out to non-residents. Her delegation's experience with respect to meeting the subsidy notification had shown the absence of knowledge and the lack of understanding of what had been undertaken during the Uruguay Round. It would be even more so for the new round of negotiations, as many small delegations would not be present to participate.","WTCOMTDM37.pdf","St., Lucia, WTO, Members, Members, India, WTO, WTO, Geneva, Weeks, General, Council, Committee, on, Budget, and, Administration, Members, Members, WTO, St., Lucia, Organisation, of, Eastern, Caribbean, States, OECS, Belize, Caribbean, Community, CARICOM, Secretariat, CARICOM, St., Lucia, OECS, OECS, Members, CARICOM, Members, OECS, Uruguay, Madagascar, Lesotho, Jamaica, Secretariat, Uruguay, Round"
"3714",3714,"48","48.      She went on to say that her delegation also wished to know how far the three-year plans which had previously been submitted by Members, had been taken into account in the preparation of the 2002 Plan. She noted that the TAMC had been established to ensure the coordination and coherence of technical assistance activities within the Secretariat and between the WTO and other organisations. However, it was unclear how the TAMC prepared the Plan and the factors that had determined which activities were chosen. She suggested that, for the sake of transparency, the Secretariat give its rationale for the choice of activities in the Plan. She further indicated that it would be useful if the Secretariat indicated how the activities would be audited, to ensure that quality technical assistance was delivered and that the objectives of the technical cooperation strategy were being met. With respect to the coordinated delivery of technical assistance, she pointed out that in the new Plan, the Secretariat had underscored the need to improve its approach in the delivery of technical assistance by ensuring the effective, coordinated delivery of technical assistance in conjunction with inter-agency groups, bilateral donors and international organisations. That was a positive step, as technical cooperation with those bodies, particularly international organisations such as the World Bank, and the infra structural type technical assistance offered by those organisations would assist in addressing issues related to supply-side constraints faced by a number of LDCs and developing countries, including her own. With respect to the ""Singapore Issues"", she noted that Annex I did not clearly indicate how technical assistance in those areas would be approached. The Doha Declaration, with respect to the ""Singapore Issues"", had pointed out that a decision to launch negotiations on the modalities of the negotiations would be taken by explicit consensus by Members, at the Fifth Ministerial Conference. The emphasis placed on those issues within the Plan, should not be done in a manner that would appear to pre-judge the launching of the negotiations in those areas. She emphasised the need for secure and stable funding for the range of technical assistance activities planned for 2002 and beyond. The Work Programme launched at Doha was a challenging one, and as the Programme evolved and Members became more aware of their technical assistance needs either in relation to the negotiations or the programmes in the standing Councils and Committees, the demand for technical assistance and capacity building would increase. It was therefore imperative that adequate and stable funding be secured. Finally, she said that the Secretariat had indicated that it intended to adhere to the 2002 Plan, but that there would be some flexibility in its implementation, as Members would still be able to submit requests for additional technical assistance throughout the year. In response to the Secretariat's request that Members kept ad hoc requests to a minimum, her delegation still hoped that the Secretariat would look favourably upon such requests from Members.","WTCOMTDM37.pdf","Members, TAMC, Secretariat, WTO, Secretariat, Secretariat, Secretariat, World, Bank, Members, Work, Programme, Doha, Members, Secretariat, Members, Secretariat, Members, Secretariat, Members"
"3713",3713,"47","47.      The representative of Jamaica recalled that at the Doha Ministerial Conference, Ministers had emphasised the critical importance of technical assistance and capacity building in facilitating the participation of developing and LDCs in the WTO Work Programme, including the broad based negotiations launched at Doha. To that end, eleven operative paragraphs of the Doha Declaration reflected the commitment to the provision of technical assistance. She drew attention to paragraph 38 of the Declaration, which stated that in the provision of technical assistance ""priority shall also be accorded to small, vulnerable, and transition economies, as well as to Members and Observers without representation in Geneva."" While her delegation recognised and applauded the efforts of the Secretariat in attempting to respond to the overwhelming demand for technical assistance from Members, her delegation was concerned with the way in which small economies were dealt with in the Plan. It was not clear how far the needs and concerns of those countries were being addressed, and an examination of the Plan suggested that work needed to be done to fulfill the mandate as identified in paragraph 38. For example, the Caribbean region included many small island developing countries, most of whom were non-resident members of the WTO. Those countries in particular, needed a range of technical assistance activities to be kept abreast of the work conducted in the WTO; to facilitate their participation in the WTO negotiations and to enhance their supply-side capabilities. However, most of the technical assistance activities, in which Jamaica would be involved, would be in the form of regional seminars and workshops, with minimum attention being paid to technical assistance at the national level. While the regional dimension of the WTO strategy was an important component, she indicated that the new strategy should recognise, as far as possible, the technical assistance requirements of individual countries within regions. While her government was fully committed to regional cooperation, and recognised the place of regional activities in the delivery of technical assistance, she drew attention to the fact that there were certain limitations to regional WT/COMTD/M/37 Page 16 seminars. For example, participation was usually limited to one or two officials from each country, which therefore placed a limit on the participation of the public sector and, in particular, the private sector. It was not easy to obtain the required level of private sector participation, since it was usually difficult for private sector participants to fund their own participation.","WTCOMTDM37.pdf","Jamaica, LDCs, WTO, Work, Programme, Doha, Members, Geneva, Secretariat, Members, Caribbean, WTO, WTO, WTO, Jamaica, WTO"

The representative of Indonesia said that his delegation supported the view of the delegation of Madagascar, that the WTO should permit Members to submit requests on issues and sectors which were not yet included in the Plan. With respect to Section III of the Plan on national technical assistance programmes, he requested the inclusion of his country in the 2002 Plan. His Government required technical missions under the WTO technical assistance programmes which aimed at a better understanding of the implications of the services negotiations, as well as issues initiated at Singapore, which were particular to the economic development of the country.","WTCOMTDM37.pdf","Indonesia, Madagascar, WTO, Members, WTO, Singapore"

The representative of Nigeria said that his delegation was of the view that it was a step towards the implementation of the Doha mandate on technical assistance to build capacity of WTO Members and prepare them for the challenges ahead. He appreciated the three activities earmarked for Nigeria and the regional African activities under the Plan. However, there was a need for better coordination with other agencies providing technical assistance, to prevent duplication.","WTCOMTDM37.pdf","Nigeria, Doha, WTO, Members, Nigeria"

The representative of Kenya said that technical assistance and capacity building were core elements of WTO's work, and indicated that it would be a mistake if the efforts already undertaken                                                                                     WT/COMTD/M/37                                                                                            Page 15 were not recognized. Success would depend on the level and quality of technical assistance provided to developing countries. He welcomed the planned activities, but wished to see some of the activities address the specific request to enhance his Government's negotiating capacity and skills on subjects, especially those specified in the Doha Declaration. His delegation was of the view that room should be made for counties to identify some of its more pressing needs. His delegation had already submitted its specific requirements to the Secretariat, and was willing to discuss it, to see where it would fit in the current planned activities. He requested a similar clarification with respect to JITAP as the representative of Ghana had requested.","WTCOMTDM37.pdf","Kenya, WTO, Secretariat, Ghana"
"3708",3708,"42","42.      The representative of Morocco said that his delegation was of the view that the implementation of the Programme of Action in the area of technical assistance and capacity building augured well, given the greatly improved financial conditions and the different activities programmed. He believed that ad hoc requests should be permitted to allow some flexibility for developing countries, although they should be limited in number. With respect to Annex II, which dealt with the ""Singapore Issues"", Morocco had already, at a regional level, organised activities in those areas; specifically, the Euro-Mediterranean Conference on Competition Law, and a regional seminar on government procurement. Those had allowed for a better understanding of these complex issues. He indicated that his government would be willing to host a regional workshop on any of these issues, in which African countries and developing countries generally, still had a lot of work to do. His Government also renewed its offer to host a third study-cycle for Moroccan and African students on WTO-issues. One of the benefits from that type of activity was that it assisted the WTO in its overall training in the public and private sectors. With respect to the activities for 2002, his government was happy to host the two regional seminars which were being organised in Morocco on dispute settlement and trade policy in order to better understand the WTO Agreements, and assured the Secretariat that everything would be done by the organisers to have successful events.","WTCOMTDM37.pdf","Morocco, Morocco, WTO, Morocco, WTO, Secretariat"
"3707",3707,"41","41.      The representative of Ghana said that he sought a clarification with respect to the national technical assistance programmes listed for Ghana on page 23 - in the Topics column, ""WTO Agreements"". He recalled that his delegation had made some requests for technical assistance in the past, which might have included WTO Agreements. He asked if what was contained in the Plan was based on that request. He further noted that the Plan was targeted toward effectiveness in the upcoming negotiations, and his delegation did not need knowledge of WTO Agreements in general for that purpose. What was needed was specific technical assistance based on his Government's specific needs. He therefore enquired whether the Plan was finalised or whether it could be modified, as his delegation needed to identify the type of assistance it needed.","WTCOMTDM37.pdf","Ghana, Ghana, WTO, WTO"
"3706",3706,"40","40.      The representative of Uganda, speaking on behalf of the LDCs said that the importance of technical assistance to LDC could not be over-emphasised. He therefore asked for LDC issues to be given more visibility and not be mixed with those of other developing countries. That should not be done at the expense of other developing countries, but given their position as LDCs and their well known capacity constraints, LDCs should be given more visibility. He indicated that the LDCs were willing to work with the Secretariat in the preparation of the final document, to ensure greater visibility and more LDC-focussed programmes.","WTCOMTDM37.pdf","Uganda, LDCs, LDCs, LDCs, Secretariat"

Before going to the next agenda item, the Chairman noted that Mr. Peter Tulloch had retired, and therefore took the opportunity to indicate how appreciative he was of his contribution to the WT/COMTD/M/37 Page 2 Organisation, and that he had personally benefitted from his advice, objectivity and the trust he had won from all sections of the Membership and he wished him well in his endeavours. The Chairman said that he hoped that those views reflected the views of the Committee.","WTCOMTDM37.pdf","Chairman, Peter, Tulloch, Organisation, Chairman, Committee"
"3704",3704,"39","39.      The representative of Belize said that with respect to enhancing negotiating capacity, paragraph 5(iii) of the document spoke to the ""Singapore Issues"", and trade and the environment. His delegation was of the view that that reference seemed to suggest that that Plan treated those issues at a higher level than the other issues. That was true when taken within the context of paragraph 38 of the Doha Ministerial Declaration, which called for ""technical assistance and capacity-building to support efforts for national plans for economic development and strategies for poverty reduction"". That should not be the case, since the reality was that many developing countries still suffered from negotiating capacity-deficits in other areas of trade of particular export-interest to them. With respect WT/COMTD/M/37 Page 14 to the nomenclature of the different activities within the Plan, he asked what the difference was between symposiums, seminars and workshops. He enquired whether they had different levels of importance and/or programme-content. If that was the case, he further enquired what the differences were in the benefits that would be derived to participants in the respective programmes. Paragraph 10 of the Plan called for the Secretariat and the Members to work together to ensure that technical assistance is delivered within a coherent policy framework. However, it made no suggestions with respect to how assessments of the benefits of the technical assistance and capacity-building efforts would be made. His delegation was of the view that this was critical for measuring the effectiveness of the programmes and determine what the future work plans should be. In closing, he joined the representative of India in expressing concern with respect to the comment that the WTO was not a development institution. His delegation did not suggest that it was a developing institution, but for many developing countries development assumed a trade-led approach. Given the resource and capacity-constraints of those countries, the importance of trade as a vehicle for development imbued the WTO with a certain dimension, if not personality, of development, and that could not be denied. To do so would undermine the so called ""Development Round"".","WTCOMTDM37.pdf","Belize, Secretariat, Members, India, WTO, WTO"

He also thanked the donors that had announced contributions, and urged others to do so rapidly, since the success of the Plan and LDCs depended on their assistance. He also noted the apprehensions of the Secretariat, with respect to being overwhelmed by ad hoc activities, and therefore suggested that regional programmes should be complemented by national programmes. With respect to the multiplicity of activities foreseen, he agreed with the need to coordinate with other organisations such as UNCTAD. Despite the multiplicity of activities, the needs of LDCs were still not met. He enquired whether the confirmation of certain activities would be made by the Secretariat, the beneficiary countries, or during consultations.","WTCOMTDM37.pdf","Burundi, LDCs, Secretariat, UNCTAD, Secretariat"
"3702",3702,"37","37.      The representative of Zambia said that the Plan, for his country as an LDC, lacked visibility of the wishes expressed by Ministers at Doha. Document WT/COMTD/W/90 stated that ""Although all developing countries are entitled to WTO technical assistance, Members however, have asked for priority to be accorded to the Least-Developed Countries, African countries, non-residents, and modest and capacity-constrained Missions."" That wish did not seem to have been reflected in the Plan, and he therefore asked for a section be included in the Plan, focusing on the special needs of LDCs, as had been identified in the Uruguay Round, at the Fourth Ministerial Conference, and in the document referred to. He thanked the representative of Norway for highlighting that point. He then sought clarification with respect to paragraph 2(iii), which dealt with the IF. What was referred to as the re-vamped IF was actually the pilot-IF which currently only concerned three countries. He enquired whether that meant that only those three countries would be considered as priority-countries. If that was not the case, he enquired how the Secretariat intended to operate in order for all other LDCs to be included. In the same paragraph, he was also concerned by what appeared to be a condition of mainstreaming trade, as an imposition of a conditionality for technical assistance. His delegation had always argued that the IF should address other trade-related technical assistance needs and should not highlight mainstreaming, as the condition to be met. Finally, the lack of focus and visibility on LDCs was also evident in the distribution of programmes. For instance, the LDCs had not received a sufficient number of programmes in Section III on national technical assistance programmes.","WTCOMTDM37.pdf","Zambia, Doha, WTO, Members, Uruguay, Round, Norway, Secretariat, LDCs"

"3700",3700,"35","35.      He went on to say that in paragraph 6 of the Plan, the Secretariat refered to a number of elements which his delegation considered important. The first point related to coordination. Coordination related to at least three levels. The first level of coordination, was coordination within the requesting members, for both national and regional projects. Requestors needed to have good internal coordination for their requests for technical cooperation from the Secretariat. His Government had coordinated internally in making requests to the Secretariat. Since China was such a large country with a population of 1.3 billion people, and more than 30 provinces and independent cities under the direct leadership of the central government, it would be difficult if everyone made individual requests to the Secretariat for technical assistance. It would be difficult not only for the Secretariat, but also for the Chinese Government. His delegation therefore believed that the coordination within the requesting parties was important to make full use of available human and financial resources, both of the Secretariat and of the requesting Members. The second area of coordination was the internal coordination of the Secretariat. He noticed that in Annex III of the Plan, the Secretariat had given a list of contact persons in different Divisions. He found that useful, but it did not mean that every Member should be encouraged to directly contact those officers for their technical cooperation projects, since, whenever an individual request was made directly to a particular person, that person responsible for a specific area of business in that Division, would sometimes respond directly to the requestor. That would confuse the situation and sabotage the coordination efforts of the Secretariat and the requesting Member. The final area of coordination related to the coordination between the WTO Secretariat and other international agencies. His delegation had found some references to the importance of coordination of that type in the Plan. It was stated that the WTO                                                                                     WT/COMTD/M/37                                                                                            Page 13 Secretariat was ready to strengthen that sort of coordination, not only to avoid duplication but also to promote mutual complementarity, and he encouraged the Secretariat to continue those efforts. In paragraph 6, the Secretariat also referred to the flexibility of the Plan and flexibility with respect to implementation. Flexibility was also important, given inter alia, the emergence of new Members, the applications for accessions, and the launch of the new Round. Rapid implementation of the Plan was therefore important. Finally, the Secretariat had rightly drawn the attention of Members to the fact that they should request as few ad hoc technical cooperation projects as possible, as that would sabotage the whole Plan if not properly managed. Ad hoc requests could not be avoided, but they should be kept to a minimum. He indicated that China wished to keep ad hoc requests to a minimum, although he could not guarantee that his country would never make such a request.","WTCOMTDM37.pdf","Secretariat, Secretariat, Secretariat, China, Secretariat, Secretariat, Secretariat, Members, Secretariat, Secretariat, Member, Secretariat, Member, WTO, Secretariat, WTO, Page, 13, Secretariat, Secretariat, Secretariat, Members, Secretariat, Members, China"

The representative of China said that he wished to take this first official opportunity, as a new Member, to express his delegation's thanks to the Secretariat for the technical assistance provided to China during the whole process of China's negotiations on its resumption of Contracting Party status, as well as in the few years of negotiations with the WTO on accession. His delegation believed that that technical assistance had been useful, not only for the projects offered to China over the years, but also the training courses which had been offered by the Secretariat to Chinese officials. For instance, many Chinese officials in charge of WTO affairs, except the speaker, had been trained by the Secretariat, particularly through the Trade Policy Courses. That was the case for the Director-General for the Department of International Relations, who had taken care of China's accessions negotiations over the past 15 years; the Director-General for the current Department of WTO Affairs of the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation (MOFTEC); and the Director-General for the newly established Fair Trade Bureau, which also dealt with WTO Affairs in MOFTEC. The seminars, workshops and advisory studies provided by the Technical Cooperation Division, which was currently headed by Mr. Osakwe, had also offered help to his delegation in its familiarisation with the rules of the WTO, and the strengthening of the negotiating capacity of his Government, mainly in its accession process. His delegation therefore believed that technical cooperation was important, not only to other developing countries, but also to China as a new developing Member.","WTCOMTDM37.pdf","China, Member, Secretariat, China, China, Contracting, Party, WTO, China, Secretariat, WTO, Secretariat, Director-General, Department, of, International, Relations, China, Director-General, Department, of, WTO, Ministry, of, Foreign, Trade, and, Economic, Cooperation, MOFTEC, Director-General, Fair, Trade, Bureau, WTO, MOFTEC, Technical, Cooperation, Division, Osakwe, WTO, China, Member"

The representative of Guinea said that the number of activities planned for 2002 was an indication of the extent to which technical assistance was important to developing countries, especially LDCs, including Guinea. Her delegation had already forwarded its comments, with amendments, to the Technical Cooperation Division. She indicated that her Government wished to participate in the detailed technical assistance programme during 2002. As stated by the representative of Malaysia, her delegation also wished the countries selected to host the seminars to be more varied, to allow for more diversified participation in the seminars. Given the burden of work post-Doha, her delegation wished to approach the Secretariat about the seminar to be organised in Guinea, in coordination with the Technical Cooperation Division. With respect to cooperation with other organisations such as FAO and UNCTAD, her delegation had contacted them with a view to establishing a work-programme on post-Doha affairs in connection with their mandates. Her delegation invited the CTD to endorse the Plan, and invited all partners to finance the 15 million CHF needed for technical cooperation, in order to make progress in the short time available.","WTCOMTDM37.pdf","Guinea, Guinea, Technical, Cooperation, Division, Malaysia, Secretariat, Guinea, Technical, Cooperation, Division, UNCTAD"
"3697",3697,"32","32.      The representative of the Philippines said that the activities in the Plan were part of the process of development, and the WTO technical assistance experience was not longer than that of other Geneva-based institutions. Nevertheless, the tables gave a good view of the broad scope of the activities, objectives and coverage of WTO technical assistance, without indicating the quality of the outcome. That was something that had to be developed. He hoped that those who had serious interests in technical assistance would focus and pay more attention to the capacity, and later to the consolidation and quality-control of the 442 activities. He said that he had a side comment regarding the statement that the WTO was not a development organisation. He would no longer object to that type of statement, because, as he had understood from the respresentative of India, the development perceptions of most of the delegations were for ""hard"" infrastructure including roads, bridges and irrigation. The technical assistance the WTO could provide was in terms of ""soft"" infrastructure such as the human capital and the institutions that would allow developing countries to achieve the objectives of their development. That was the objective of the CTD. With respect to the tables, his delegation believed that the Secretariat had done a good job as far as the balance of activities, objectives and regional distribution were concerned. His delegation was satisfied with the planned activities by regions, as indicated on page 47. However, in the individual presentations there were indications of various activities for which dates were to be confirmed, which he knew meant that the activities were either not funded, or not definite. He therefore still had a problem with respect to the prioritising being made on the basis of the budgetary resources available. He hoped that the case of the LDCs, as stated by the representative of India, would be taken into consideration, and indicated that a number of consultations also had to be undertaken with the prospective recipients, to allow the WTO to respond to their legitimate objectives with the technical assistance provided. For example, his delegation did not see SMC–issues as concrete activities since there were to be consultations on the kind of technical assistance that would be needed during the first month of 2002. He enquired whether it was being undertaken by the WTO or whether it was being done within the context of UNCTAD's work. He noted that there had been regional discussions with UNCTAD, and that UNCTAD had plans for a broad approach to the requirements of the Doha Development Agenda in the areas of investment, competition policy, and trade facilitation. The objectives of UNCTAD were broad, as was its membership. UNCTAD therefore had to conform to the desires and objectives of its membership. With respect to the fourth sentence of the first paragraph on page 41, it was implied that the ""Singapore Issues"" had already been agreed to in negotiations, and that the focus of the work therefore was on addressing the negotiating elements. In his view it was far broader than that. The issue had been addressed by some delegations in the Informal Group of Developing Countries, and the Secretariat had responded that it would look at it. He stressed that since it was an evolving process, each activity should be analysed in terms of its outcome, and be incorporated into a cross- sectoral analysis from the perspective of the Membership with a view to seeing if there was need for more training tools, more outreaches to regions and institutions and more training and capacity building. If the analysis was done in the regions, by the Members, rather than from the perspective of persons based in Geneva, the training courses could be improved. A new set of programmes would be developed in 2003, and there should then be close consultations with the prospective beneficiaries of the training courses, in order to ensure that it would be useful to them with respect to their WTO obligations. The matrix should also be viewed in the context of technical assistance from other Geneva-based institutions, banking and international financial institutions, which hoped to achieve similar objectives, so that the IF principle, which was a good one, could be achieved as far as the type and quality of the WTO's technical assistance programmes was concerned.

"3696",3696,"31","31.      The representative of Lesotho said that his delegation found the Plan adequate for what it considered as a priority. He supported the view that there was a need to highlight the assistance or work being undertaken at the bilateral level to avoid overlaps. Cooperation between the donors and the recipient states was therefore important. With respect to ad hoc requests, his delegation noted the comments of previous speakers on the need to limit them. However, for most countries, in particular developing countries and LDCs, the process of analysing the outcome and the implications of the Doha Work Programme was ongoing, and there was therefore a need to provide alternate allowances for countries to supplement the requests that they had originally submitted to the Secretariat to reflect their improved understanding of the implications of the Doha Conference. The Secretariat should be given the flexibility to assist countries when they submitted such requests, while recognising that this should not be the regular route. With respect to the need for improved coordination with other organisations such as UNCTAD, he indicated that his delegation had been in contact with UNCTAD                                                                                    WT/COMTD/M/37                                                                                           Page 11 to discuss how to implement the Doha Work Programme. The UNCTAD Secretariat had made suggestions on how to address some of the issues. The work that had already been started had to be taken into account when considering the Programmes that were now being embarked on in the WTO. His final point related to the coordination with regional economic bodies. When regional seminars were undertaken there should be maximum coordination with those bodies to ensure that coverage and priorities identified by the region were reflected in the Work Programme. He proposed that, at the end of the meeting, the CTD take note of the report to enable its implementation.","WTCOMTDM37.pdf","Lesotho, Doha, Work, Programme, Secretariat, Secretariat, UNCTAD, UNCTAD, Doha, Work, Programme, Secretariat, WTO, Work, Programme, CTD"
"3695",3695,"30","30.      The representative of Norway said that his Government attached importance to the developmental aspects of the WTO agenda post-Doha. Firstly, there was a need to avoid ad hoc requests, as they were not the best way to accommodate the needs of Members. Secondly, the Plan lacked an elaboration of how coordination with other organisations would be carried out, and requested the Secretariat to briefly comment on that aspect. Thirdly, the Secretariat had indicated an interest in presenting an IF-process for non-LDCs, similar to the current IF programme. Such a process had to be demand-driven and there had to be a close dialogue between donors and recipients. He noted that in Section I of the Plan, 158 regional seminars and multilateral conferences were planned. Given the high number of activities, he wished to know whether they were based on evaluations of previous seminars and conferences. He noted that there was a wide geographical spread and indicated that if there was a need to trim the number of activities, LDCs should be given priority. There were less activities planned with respect to trade-related capacity building in Section II. As to Section III of the Plan, on technical assistance related to the WTO Agreements, which normally would be the core business of the WTO, he recognised that there was a wide geographical spread in terms of beneficiary countries and queried the inclusion of some of the more well-off developing countries. He further asked whether self-payment for those countries had been considered and whether visits by Committee Chairs to countries seeking accession would be covered by the Fund. His final question was whether the activities related to the thirteen countries, which were also included in the IF Programme, would be funded by the IF fund or the Global Trust Fund.","WTCOMTDM37.pdf","Norway, WTO, Members, Secretariat, Secretariat, LDCs, WTO, WTO, Committee, Chairs, Global, Trust, Fund"

The representative of Madagascar asked the Secretariat to make a greater effort to get translations out more rapidly, since her delegation only had received the French translation that morning. However, her delegation hoped that that would not be a problem for much longer since the Director-General had indicated that additional funds of 850,000 CHF had been earmarked for the translation services, in addition to the 1.5 million CHF allocated last year, as had been requested for a long time by non-English speaking delegations. She expressed the hope that the programmes which had been established would not prevent her delegation from making further requests for technical assistance in the course of the year, as needs arose.","WTCOMTDM37.pdf","Madagascar, Secretariat, Director-General"
"3691",3691,"27","27.      The representative of Senegal noted that many activities concerning his country were retained in the Plan, based on the requests made, which in turn had been based on a needs-assessment. However, that there were perhaps some adjustments to be made concerning the priority given to the activities. Some of the requests would be retained and others would not, in terms of their priority. Those might be handed into the Secretariat. He sought clarification from the Secretariat as to whether the Joint Integrated Technical Assistance Programme for Selected Least-Developed and other African Countries (JITAP) was to be completed at the end of 2002. Many developing countries had insisted that it be maintained and extended. There were currently eight countries involved, and he wished to know what would happen since there had been many references to Senegal under the JITAP Programmes, and to other countries as well. He enquired whether the Programme would be maintained, since initially there had been references of a ""second generation JITAP"". He therefore wished to know the exact future content of the Programme. His second point related to Information Technologies and the WTO Reference Centres. WTO technical assistance had to assist Geneva-based delegations maintain contact with their capitals. He did not know whether that could be done under the SITA as indicated on page 36 of the Plan. It was clear that it was important to install reference centers in capitals, but it would always be difficult for developing country delegations to carry out their tasks as long as a functioning link was not established between the Geneva missions and their capitals. The missions obviously used classical means of communication. However, it would be useful if they could use modern information technology tools to become more effective. He therefore requested more information on the SITA. He further recalled that a presentation of how a small Geneva-based developing country mission could use modern information technology tools had been made by the Ambassador of Panama. The Ambassador had demonstrated extremely interesting methods of work. That type of sharing of experiences should be increased as it enabled developing countries to learn from other delegation's experiences with coordination and contacts with capitals. There was currently a limit of 15 million CHF for WTO technical assistance and the Director-General had said that the financial programme would be further elaborated. His delegation hoped that the WT/COMTD/M/37 Page 10 WTO would be able to get the necessary resources to finance its activities, especially so as some delegations were of the view that the 15 million CHF was not sufficient.","WTCOMTDM37.pdf","Senegal, Secretariat, Secretariat, Joint, Integrated, Technical, Assistance, Programme, Senegal, Information, Technologies, WTO, WTO, SITA, Geneva, SITA, Ambassador, Panama, Ambassador, WTO, Director-General, WTO"

She noted that the recent agreement to establish the Global Trust Fund put extra emphasis on the CTD's coordination of technical assistance and capacity building activities and looked forward to that proceeding. She said that her delegation appreciated the clarity of the Plan, in particular the eight policy frameworks under which the Plan was divided, and further elaborated in paragraph 5. With respect to paragraphs 6-10 of the Introduction, on the five additional points which were underlined by the Secretariat, she agreed with the determination to limit ad hoc technical assistance activities to the greatest extent possible. However, if some legitimate and urgent requests for technical assistance did arise unexpectedly, then some flexibility in implementing the Plan would be required. Nevertheless, previous experience had shown that meeting ad hoc requests diminished the Secretariat's ability to provide long-term targeted technical assistance. With a new mandate and heavy focus on developmental issues, the achievement of long-tem goals were a vital aspect of the Organisation's work and her delegation endorsed the comments made under paragraph 6.","WTCOMTDM37.pdf","Australia, Secretariat, Doha, Development, Agenda, Global, Trust, Fund, CTD, Secretariat, Secretariat, Organisation"

That was probably due to the complex nature of the comprehensive list of activities. His delegation hoped that the Secretariat was to make activities designed to create conducive environments to the implementation of Doha commitments by responding to the specific needs of specific countries. His second point referred to the Annex I of the Plan, which indicated that the Secretariat was going to plan activities in the sectors of investment and competition policy, based on the input of meetings to be held by the WTO. He hoped that, through this process, the WTO would coordinate closely with other donors and organisations, such as UNCTAD, in order to avoid unnecessary duplication, since the limited resources available had to respond to all the requested activities. He said that his final point was similar to that expressed by the representative of the European Communities with respect to the costing and priority issues.","WTCOMTDM37.pdf","Japan, Secretariat, Doha, Secretariat, Doha, Secretariat, WTO, WTO, UNCTAD"

"3687",3687,"23","23.      The representative of the United States said that her delegation strongly supported the WTO's technical assistance agenda, and took a realistic approach to what Members agreed to at the Doha Ministerial Conference and the sentiments they all shared going into Doha concerning technical assistance and the integration of developing country Members into the multilateral trading system. Her Government had recently announced that it would submit 1 million US dollars to the new Global Trust Fund in an effort to begin the process to meet the objective that had been agreed to. With respect to the Secretariat Note she said that she had understood the Deputy Director-General to say that the CTD was being asked to adopt the ""Note by the Secretariat"". She therefore sought a procedural clarification as to what was to be done. She asked whether the intention was for the CTD to adopt the Secretariat Note or whether something more specific was to be adopted. She also stressed the need for coordination with other national and international organisations that provided technical assistance, as well as with other WTO bodies and Committees engaged in technical assistance activities. She was of the view that a number of the programmes and initiatives outlined did target specific agreement areas. Coordination was a priority in order to streamline and expedite the delivery of technical assistance. In the area of standards for example, as indicated in the Note, there were a number of international organisations that participated in seminars, and the same international organisations were working closely with the various standard-related Committees of the WTO. It was therefore important that there be tight coordination with the work of the other Committees. In order for the strategy to be effective, there had to be a focus on monitoring, auditing and evaluating the implementation of the technical assistance provided. She hoped that all of the projects that had been identified, including the specific seminars, focused on specific needs requested by the beneficiary countries. That comment also referred to the Work Plan for the ""Singapore Issues"" and she took note of the comments made by the representative of India with respect to the first paragraph on page 41. For any technical assistance issues linked to the Doha Declaration it had to be clear how the technical assistance was articulated in the Declaration. Her delegation expected that the projects in the Plan were linked to the various initiatives in the Doha Declaration. Her delegation sought more time to go through the Plan, which was one of four levels of technical assistance action. It would be kept in mind that the Plan described an evolving process and that as needs were identified and issues arose, it would be possible to accommodate those. She urged that there be coordination with other organisations that provided technical assistance and that bilateral donors would be actively involved.","WTCOMTDM37.pdf","United, States, WTO, Members, Doha, Ministerial, Conference, Doha, Members, Global, Trust, Fund, Secretariat, Note, Director-General, CTD, Secretariat, CTD, Secretariat, WTO, WTO, India"
"3686",3686,"22","22.      The representative of Paraguay agreed with the Plan and was grateful for the inclusion of three technical cooperation programmes which had been requested by his Government. He believed that the technical assistance provided by the WTO was a complement to the national training effort to meet the needs of multilateral trade at this time of globalisation. WTO technical cooperation was not a substitute for national efforts, but complemented them. Even if the Plan was not perfect, it contained aspects of the Doha decisions and requests from delegations. There had been progress in formulating the Plan and doors had been opened with other international institutions which dealt with similar matters. His delegation therefore supported the Plan.","WTCOMTDM37.pdf","Paraguay, WTO, WTO, Doha"
"3685",3685,"21","21.      He continued by saying that it was unclear how the costing process would operate. His delegation was not of the view that the Plan would cost more that 15 million CHF. He asked how priorities would be set if more costs were incurred through cooperation, since co-financing would not always be easy. Some programmes would hopefully be allocated to other international organisations who had more expertise, and more resources for the ""Singapore Issues"", for example. More clarity was needed in that area. In addition, delegations had to be informed about how much the WTO Secretariat could really deliver with its own resources. That would make the Plan a more credible WT/COMTD/M/37 Page 8 document and would help it respond to the challenges which the CTD faced. His delegation was looking forward to receiving an interim report to the General Council in December 2002. He was certain that the Organisation and the donors would be put to the test and asked what had been done. He therefore asked how it could be ensured that the words in the Ministerial Declaration had been turned into something tangible for developing countries. In order to be in the best possible position to give such a response, the Plan should be revised and rearranged along the lines suggested.","WTCOMTDM37.pdf","WTO, Secretariat, CTD, General, Council, Organisation"
"3684",3684,"20","20.      The representative of the European Communities said that his delegations' remarks, while suggesting improvements, should not to be taken as if his delegation did not fully appreciate the difficulties involved in the work completed. It was in his delegation's self interest to get the Plan right, as the Doha Agreement was so focused on technical assistance and capacity building, that the success or failure of the whole exercise to a large extent would be measured by what was reflected in, for example, paragraph 41 of the Doha Ministerial Declaration, from which it was clear that there had to be a stocktaking of the adequacy of the measures undertaken. The main improvement his delegation suggested was to make it clear how the Plan fitted into the new framework under which the WTO was working. The Doha Ministerial Declaration and the Technical Cooperation Strategy had been mentioned in the introduction to the Plan. The Strategy Document was also reflected, in some elements, in certain relevant paragraphs, especially paragraphs 38-41 of the Doha Ministerial Declaration. Unfortunately, the Plan still looked somewhat like the lists which had been circulated in 2001 although the imperative was to respond to paragraphs 38-41, and be able to show how the development and technical assistance challenges would be responded to by the work of the WTO Secretariat and by bilateral and multilateral donors. It might therefore not be enough to report that a regional seminar had been conducted as outlined in the first part of the Plan if it could not be tied into specific obligations to provide technical assistance. Before a seminar was decided upon, it had to be considered whether it fitted into the development strategy of the recipient, as was clearly indicated in paragraph 38 of the Declaration, how it fitted into the Doha obligations and how it fitted with the main focus of the Technical Cooperation Strategy. Those considerations should have been the point of departure for the Plan, with more information as to how those objectives were to be met by the particular measures put forward. His delegation was aware that that was not an easy task as everything could not be classified from the start. However, the political value and visibility of the responsiveness of the Organisation lay in further working out those points. Some efforts had been made in that respect and he would be more positive and concrete with respect to these points. The Annexes on Investment and Environment of the Plan were based on subjects and the type of commitments taken in the Doha Ministerial Declaration. His delegation shared the view of the representative of Switzerland, that it was not clear what was WTO's work would be and questioned whether the WTO could organise the type of seminars outlined in the Plan. It was also not clear what UNCTAD's role would be. He asked if UNCTAD would organize seminars in which the WTO would participate, or whether the WTO would organise seminars in which UNCTAD would participate. His delegation also focussed on another main theme – cooperation and coordination with other multilateral organisations. The Deputy Director-General had pointed out that that was another level of the discussion, but the document discussed some of those issues as for example in the Annexes mentioned earlier and with respect to the IF. The more complementarity there could be, the better off everyone would be. He urged the Secretariat to try to expand the Plan a little in the direction of theme-oriented programmes, such as in the areas of investment and environment, for which the proposals were embryonic. In the area of the environment, for instance, a lot more had to be done to remove some of the concerns in the area and he urged the Secretariat to take up those themes.","WTCOMTDM37.pdf","European, Communities, WTO, Technical, Cooperation, Strategy, WTO, Secretariat, Doha, Organisation, Switzerland, WTO, WTO, UNCTAD, UNCTAD, WTO, WTO, UNCTAD, Director-General, Secretariat, Secretariat"

He stated that, the CTD normally elected its Chairperson at the end of the first meeting of the year; however, the Chairman of the General Council was still in the process of holding consultations on the slate of officers for the different WTO bodies and he would report on the situation at an appropriate time at a meeting of the General Council. The Chairman of the CTD therefore suggested that the Committee elect its chairperson for 2002 at its next regular session scheduled for 14 February 2002, as the Chairmanship of the CTD could not be decided independently of the overall election of officers. He further proposed to place the election of a new chairperson as the first substantial item on the Agenda of that meeting in order to allow the incoming chairperson to chair the main part of the second meeting of the year as was the practice.","WTCOMTDM37.pdf","Chairman, CTD, Chairperson, Chairman, General, Council, WTO, General, Council, Chairman, CTD, Committee, CTD"
"3682",3682,"19","19.     The representative of Djibouti noted that there was something new in the Plan, not previously seen in WTO documentation, specifically the names of the Secretariat staff who would be dealing with each activity. However, no telephone number were given. That information would assist delegations when they wished contact the officer responsible for a particular seminar. The aim of the technical assistance paragraphs of the Ministerial Declaration was to provide a means to developing                                                                                      WT/COMTD/M/37                                                                                              Page 7 countries and LDCs to prepare themselves to enter fully into the multilateral trading system. The 15 million CHF was therefore needed to ensure the implementation of the technical cooperation activities and to train people to comply with the obligations. The IF had developed well. However, he was not aware of the results of the three pilot countries. His government was willing to host a round table and to have an expert to prepare the round table.","WTCOMTDM37.pdf","Djibouti, WTO, Secretariat, LDCs"
"3681",3681,"18","18.      He went on to note that the Plan referred specifically to, and seemed to focus on the ""Singapore issues"". He was surprised to find reference to those in paragraph 5(iii) and the second sentence in Annex I of the document, as his delegation was not aware that negotiations on ""Singapore Issues"" had been agreed. He was of the view that that was to be discussed at the Fifth Ministerial Conference and to be decided on by explicit concensus. Similarly, with respect to mainstreaming and the IF in paragraph 5(i), there was a reference to paragraph 38 of the Doha Ministerial Declaration and his delegation preferred that the language used in the Plan be the same as that in the Declaration. It would otherwise give a misleading impression that something had been agreed to in Doha which had not been agreed to. The Doha Ministerial Declaration implied technical assistance in other areas, such as rules. He specifically referred to paragraphs 34, 35, 28 and 29. There was also an implied reference in paragraph 6 of the Declaration on Public Health which had to be taken into account, so that activities in those areas would be organised. In the final section of the Plan there was a provision for video-conferencing, which was useful. However, since the video-conferencing facilities were used by many Divisions, they should not be financed through the technical assistance budget, but be part of the regular budget. In Annex V of the Plan which summarised the number of activities planned for the year 2002, there was a column containing the number of activities planned for LDCs, which made impressive reading until the footnote was read. The footnote specified that LDC activities were ""Activities held in an LDC or, in the case of regional activities, those activities to which at least an LDC is invited."" If in a group of 30 participants, one participant represented an LDC, it could not be classified as an event for LDCs. He proposed that for group activities, only those where at least 50 per cent of the participants represented LDCs, should be identified as LDC activities, and that the figures be adjusted accordingly. He went on to say that it still was unclear where the required 15 million CHF was to come from. He hoped for an early decision on a Pledging Conference to held in early 2002. He said that he did not understand the Deputy Director-General's comment about cost-sharing with other organisations, since the activities being planned were within the WTO, and the cost should therefore be borne within the WTO. One of the previous speakers had mentioned that the WTO was not a development organisation, but it was not clear what that statement meant. If what was meant, was that the WTO could not assist in establishing infrastructure facilities, such as ports and roads, he could agree, but if the technical cooperation listed in the Plan was classified in that other context, he could not agree. In the pre-Doha phase, all delegations would recollect that when developing countries had made the point that they lacked expertise in the areas of investment and competition policy, they had been told not to worry as technical assistance and capacity building would be provided. If, after that, developing countries were told that the WTO was not a development organisation, it made his delegation wonder what the meaning of the earlier statement was. The technical cooperation and capacity-building activities listed in the Plan were relevant to the WTO's core-business and that assistance had to continue to be provided to developing countries and LDCs.","WTCOMTDM37.pdf","Singapore, Doha, Public, Health, Director-General, WTO, WTO, WTO, WTO, WTO, WTO"
"3680",3680,"17","17.       The representative of India agreed with the statement of the Chairman with respect to Mr. Tulloch who had been the ""Development Pillar"" of the Institution. It was unfortunate that he had left just after Doha. He stated his deep appreciation for Mr. Tulloch's valuable contribution. He went on to say that after Doha, many delegations had announced that the ""Doha Development Agenda"" had been launched. However, soon after returning from Doha delegations had discovered that the WTO Secretariat's Development Division had been liquidated, although its work had not gone away. It had been distributed between three WTO Secretariat Divisions. Despite that reorganisation, the Plan had been put together in a short time. His delegation had argued strongly in favour of two Geneva Weeks in the Budget Committee, and that had been included in the Plan. However, to the best of his knowledge, only one Geneva Week had been approved in the Budget Committee. He therefore wished to know if only one of the Weeks would be funded by the regular budget and how the other would be financed. Irrespective of the number of Geneva Weeks actually held, a way had to be found to keep the non-resident delegations constantly informed of progress in the various negotiations launched in Doha. His second point had to do with the meaning of capacity-building. He was of the view that capacity-building went beyond the holding of seminars. He acknowledged that seminars and regional workshops were valuable inputs into capacity-building, but noted that capacity-building extended far beyond those. The capacities of developing countries varied vastly and the programmes designed should cater to the specific needs of each beneficiary country. Developing countries did not have infinite capacity to absorb technical assistance. Their capacity had to be built up slowly, and WT/COMTD/M/37 Page 6 would involve the building up of capacities from scratch on certain issues. The pace of expansion of WTO activities, on specific subjects on which developing countries did not have adequate experience, should be so planned to allow all developing countries to effectively participate in the negotiations. He recommended the consideration of the delivery of technical assistance through institutions in other countries, particularly developed countries which had knowledge and expertise in development-related issues and had specialised in topics such as international trade and economic relations, as that might be a cost-effective way of delivering technical assistance. The training of trainers would have a multiplier effect since the trainers trained from developing countries would go back and train a significant number of persons in their own countries.","WTCOMTDM37.pdf","India, Chairman, Tulloch, Doha, Tulloch, Doha, Doha, WTO, Secretariat, 's, Development, Division, WTO, Secretariat, Geneva, Weeks, Budget, Committee, Geneva, Week, Budget, Committee, Geneva, Weeks, Doha, WTO"
"3679",3679,"16","16.     The representative of Malaysia understood the work on the Plan to be a complex exercise involving the coordination and cooperation between multilateral agencies considering requests from Members as well as giving the appropriate focus to LDCs. There was a broad mix in the delivery of technical assistance between the regions and he welcomed the fact that there were a number of regional workshops which would include the participation of Members which may otherwise not be included because of a lack of priority or because of a lack of funds. In this context, he noted that there were a number of venues that were used more frequently than others, possibly because the coordinating agencies were based in those countries. However, whenever possible, regional seminars and workshops should be hosted in other locations. A better spread of venues should be encouraged, so as to provide opportunities to additional Members to enhance their participation in the seminars. He further noted that the funding of the programmes was still pending, and would welcome pledges from donors to the Global Trust Fund so that those activities would be fully funded.","WTCOMTDM37.pdf","Malaysia, Members, Members, Members, Global, Trust, Fund"
"3678",3678,"15","15.     The representative of the Uruguay said that he had appreciated the initiative by the Secretariat to meet with regional groups to present the Plan for 2002. GRULAC was one of the groups that had benefitted from direct contact with the Secretariat. That contact had allowed them to get advance knowledge of the document and send it to their capitals in a timely manner. He hoped that that practice would continue in the future. His delegation thanked the Secretariat for including a national seminar on services in Uruguay, in the list of activities for the current year. He noted the position of the Secretariat to avoid ad hoc technical assistance requests. The 422 activities already planned for 2002 clearly showed that there was a significant planning for 2002. However, he reserved his delegation's right to make new technical assistance requests as necessary, bearing in mind the large agenda which arose from the fourth Ministerial Conference. There would be a national seminar on competition policy in Uruguay in the first half of the year 2002, in conjunction with other organisations. Bearing in mind what was stated in Annex I of the Plan with respect to capacity building and technical assistance in relation to the Singapore issues, he requested the support of the WTO Secretariat in planning that seminar.","WTCOMTDM37.pdf","Uruguay, Secretariat, Secretariat, Secretariat, Uruguay, Secretariat, Uruguay, Singapore, WTO, Secretariat"
"3677",3677,"14","14.      The representative of Switzerland indicated that his delegation would do its best to assist the Technical Cooperation Division in its difficult task. The WTO was not meant to be a development organisation, but there was a need for the WTO to provide technical assistance and build capacity in developing countries. He further reported that in a joint meeting of the OECD (DAC) and the Inter-Agency Working Group of the IF the previous week, the Chairman of the OECD Trade Committee had emphasised that capacity-building efforts in the WTO were of paramount importance for the further development of the multilateral trading system. Trade-related technical assistance had to take place in the WTO. The OECD Trade Committee, chaired by Switzerland, wished to convey to the CTD that it would follow those activities with interest and would be as supportive as possible. To be effective and efficient, the fullest possible transparency regarding the delivery of technical assistance was necessary. The report on capacity building that the Director-General would prepare for the General Council at the end of the year and for the next Ministerial Conference should not only present the activities at the multilateral level, but also those at the bilateral level. A compendium should also be prepared in collaboration with the relevant international organisations and donor countries on all trade-related technical assistance. With respect to Annex I of the 2002 Plan, he indicated that a focussed and enhanced technical assistance plan in the field of trade and investment, was to be discussed, and UNCTAD should be invited to participate in that process. He indicated that he had been informed that UNCTAD had already made a first draft of a post-Doha technical assistance proposal in the area of investment. He asked whether the WTO investment activities proposed in the 2002 Plan were coordinated with UNCTAD as his delegation would not wish to see similar activities conducted in parallel in both organisations. On the issue of transparency, he enquired whether there were country-specific lists which summarised the trade-related technical assistance activities delivered in the past. Such detailed lists by activity would be useful and he asked the Secretariat to prepare such lists in the future, in collaboration with other organisations. His delegation agreed with the Deputy Director-General's comment that ad hoc requests should only be met in exceptional circumstances. For full transparency with respect to ad hoc requests, he proposed that the Secretariat list the countries making such requests together with the subject area of their requests. He did not believe that the point had been reached where stand-alone technical activities were being turned into long-term sustainable and effective capacity-building. What was needed was                                                                                      WT/COMTD/M/37                                                                                              Page 5 to put in place a process for comprehensive trade-related capacity-building and move away from individual activities. He noted that the technical assistance strategy contained some elements that might assist, such as the coordinating committees at the country-level, or interlocking trade policy reviews with the design of country-specific capacity building. Those were future pursuits. The evaluation of the activities should also be part of transparency and effectiveness.","WTCOMTDM37.pdf","Switzerland, Technical, Cooperation, Division, WTO, WTO, OECD, Inter-Agency, Working, Group, Chairman, OECD, Trade, Committee, WTO, WTO, OECD, Trade, Committee, Switzerland, CTD, Director-General, General, Council, UNCTAD, UNCTAD, WTO, UNCTAD, Secretariat, Director-General, Secretariat"
"3676",3676,"13","13.      The representative of Canada thanked the Secretariat for the immense amount of work devoted to the preparation of the documents that the CTD had before it and indicated that her delegation understood how complex the process was when five separate sets of activities had to be brought together to create the Plan. Her delegation recommended that the Plan be more closely identified with the activities linked to the Doha commitments. That linkage could be made, although it might not be easy since activities related to several different commitments. However, that was important from a strategic perspective, and would allow the Committees to relate to the Plan, analyse the Plan and understand the Plan as it related to their areas of expertise.","WTCOMTDM37.pdf","Canada, Secretariat, CTD, Doha"
"3675",3675,"12","12.      He then indicated that the Plan was divided into six sections, as they appeared in document WT/COMTD/W/90/Add.1. In view of the importance attached in the Ministerial Declaration to the Singapore issues, Annex I was dedicated to these issues. That Annex explained the overarching strategy underpinning the Singapore issues, and showed how technical assistance would be delivered in those areas, including in coordination with other competent agencies. Annex II was dedicated to trade and environment, in light of the negotiations agreed by Members. Paragraph 5 of the Introduction highlighted the areas of action covered in light of the Doha mandates, namely: (i) mainstreaming and Integrated Framework;            (ii) implementation issues and concerns; (iii) enhancing negotiating capacity;      (iv) trade-policy capacity-building;      (v) accessions; (vi) non-residents; (vii) WTO reference centres and information technology support; and (viii) modernization and expansion of technical assistance tools. He appealed to Members to limit ad hoc requests throughout the year. He noted that some planned activities would be cancelled or postponed, WT/COMTD/M/37 Page 4 while others would be ad hoc. He said that the CTD would recall the difficulties involved in ensuring an appropriate balance in the management of technical assistance, when the ratio between the planned activities and the ad hoc activities was unbalanced. In the 1980s and 1990s the ad hoc activities had represented a higher proportion than the planned activities, with the result that they had become difficult to organise. Since the number of planned activities in 2002 (422 in total) significantly exceeded the levels for previous years, the Secretariat would attach priority to planned activities, and would seek the cooperation and understanding of Members to ensure adherence to the Annual Plan. He clarified that ad hoc requests and activities that arose or were requested by Members throughout the year 2002 would be considered for the 2003 Plan, except when the most exceptional of circumstances would justify financing and integrating them into the 2002 activities. In concluding he urged the Members to be foresighted, and think of the next 3-4 years. In order to get the maximum benefit from the scarce financial and human resources, it was important to follow the plan agreed to at the beginning of the year. A flood of ad hoc activities would take up too much time and resources and would upset the balance of activities planned.","WTCOMTDM37.pdf","Singapore, Singapore, Members, Doha, WTO, Members, CTD, Secretariat, Members, Members, Members"
"3674",3674,"11","11.      He went on to emphasise that with respect to the budgetary and financial aspects of the Plan, the cost had not yet been fully assessed. In principle however, the cost should not exceed the 15 million CHF which had been agreed to in the Committee on Budget and Finance. That figure depended on parameters such as the sensitive issue of cost-sharing with other organisations with which the WTO Secretariat cooperated and the number of participants to be invited from each Ministry. Once the financing of the programme had finally been determined, a statement would be made by the Secretariat. He drew the CTD's attention to the fact that the Plan was only one of four levels of action that the WTO Secretariat would pursue in the implementation of the technical cooperation and capacity building objectives in 2002. The other levels of action, which would be pursued interdependently were: (i) effective coordinated delivery of technical assistance with well-defined inter-agency groups/multilateral agencies. That would focus on areas such as the Singapore Issues, and areas where synergies would be required with other multilateral institutions; (ii) the Integrated Framework (IF) for Trade-Related Technical Assistance to the Least-Developed Countries (LDCs). Action at that level would be based on the re-vamped Integrated Framework as a mechanism for mainstreaming trade priority areas of action into the development plans and strategies for poverty reduction of the LDCs; and (iii) effective coordinated delivery of technical assistance by the WTO and bilateral donors through interaction with the Development Assistance Committee (DAC) of the OECD.","WTCOMTDM37.pdf","Committee, on, Budget, and, Finance, WTO, Secretariat, Ministry, Secretariat, CTD, WTO, Secretariat, Singapore, Integrated, Framework, LDCs, WTO, Development, Assistance, Committee, OECD"
"3673",3673,"10","10.     Deputy Director-General Mr. Paul-Henri Ravier introduced the Secretariat-wide Plan for Technical Assistance in 2002. He requested Members' comments and guidance as the implementation of the Plan proceeded with the delivery of the activities. The activities contained in the Plan were operational activities based on mandates already established by Ministers, Decisions taken by the Membership in various Committees and Councils, and demands by the Membership. The Doha Ministerial Declaration confirmed that technical cooperation and capacity-building were core elements of the development dimension of the multilateral trading system. Ministers had established                                                                                   WT/COMTD/M/37                                                                                           Page 3 an extensive mandate and had undertaken a firm set of commitments on technical cooperation and capacity building to enable beneficiary countries to implement WTO rules and obligations, and prepare them for effective participation in the work of the WTO, including for future negotiations and an extensive Work Programme, as well as enable them to draw on the benefits of the multilateral trading system. Document WT/COMTD/W/95 outlined the Coordinated WTO Secretariat Annual Technical Assistance Plan for 2002 and contained the activities the WTO Secretariat could deliver within its area of competence, resources, and what was possible within an 11-month period. The Plan had been subjected to the fullest possible internal coordination by the WTO Secretariat Technical Assistance Management Committee (TAMC) which had been established last year. It was also based on information available to the Secretariat, under the time constraints post-Doha given the fact that implementation was to begin that month. The activities in the Plan were based on inputs from five sources, namely: (i) mandates on technical cooperation and capacity building in the Doha Ministerial Declaration as contained in paragraphs 16, 21, 24, 26, 27, 33, 38-40, 42 and 43; (ii) the New Strategy for WTO Technical Cooperation for Capacity-building, Growth and Integration – which was noted by the October 2002 CTD Meeting and endorsed by Ministers in paragraph 38 of the Doha Declaration; (iii) requests from the Membership and countries in accession to the WTO Secretariat.

The remaining costs, for example maintenance, staff, electricity, water and waste disposal, are covered by the Infoplaza administrative partner.

In addition, the CTD might wish to make some input into the Rio Plus Ten Conference which so far only had been discussed under the Committee on Trade and Environment. It should be kept in mind that that conference treated the issue of development as well and might entail some future work for the CTD for coherence and policy consistency reasons.

At the same time, it was clear that as a result of the 4th Ministerial Conference the WTO had a great deal of additional development-related work to do. Not all that work would be carried out in the Committee on Trade and Development. Some areas were mentioned as falling under the aegis of other WTO bodies such as work on small economies, trade, debt and finance and trade and transfer of technology which would be carried out under the General Council. Paragraph 51 of the Ministerial Declaration dealt with developmental aspects of the negotiations. It was clear that the Committee on Trade and Development was named as the forum where development-related aspects of the negotiations should be identified and debated. In addition, he recalled that both the CTD and the Committee on Trade and Environment had been asked to do work in relation to sustainable development. It was clear that that work covered elements of sustainability and development and that the CTD next year would have to look at what those concerns were. That work might require cooperative efforts among Members and the Secretariat on both development and environment issues. In addition to the identified areas, the CTD might be involved in reviewing and assessing the overall WTO Work Programme and a particular role might be envisaged for the CTD in relation to the expanded programme for technical assistance and capacity building.

He noted, with respect to seminars, that revenue implications was one of the horizontal issues taken up in the General Council. He reiterated that Members should participate in the drawing up of the agenda for the seminars so that the process be as Member-driven as possible. He had some concerns with the wording of paragraph 4 of the Work Programme which stated that the results of the seminars be ""fed back into the regular work of the WTO.

A revised version, contained in document WT/COMTD/W/92, had been before the Committee at its last meeting. While there had not been any objections to the content, some delegations had believed that the CTD should wait for the 4th Ministerial Conference before moving ahead with the work programme. He therefore hoped that delegations were in a position to consider the draft work programme in the CTD. The work programme was of course without prejudice to any decision the General Council might take with respect to the overall WTO Work Programme on Electronic Commerce. The draft work programme for the CTD outlined work the Committee could pursue in respect of the development implications of e-commerce and it also suggested the format such work could take. As he had said before, he believed that the work programme should be flexible enough to take account of requests from the General Council and individual Members as well as opportunities to invite speakers who happened to be in Geneva.","WTCOMTDM36.pdf","Chairman, CTD, Committee, CTD, General, Council, WTO, Work, Programme, CTD, Committee, General, Council, Members, Geneva"

The representative of UNCTAD said, in response to the question posed by the representative of the United States, that there were some similarities and some differences between the World Bank and the UNCTAD studies. More of less the same limited number of product categories had been used in both. However, the UNCTAD Secretariat had used a slightly different classification code for its calculations which had allowed it to separate software products from other products. The UNCTAD Secretariat calculations also included a larger number of countries, in particular more developing countries, than had been included in the World Bank study. Furthermore, apart from the tariff calculations, the UNCTAD Secretariat had added another database to calculate other customs surcharges and import taxes on those products. The UNCTAD Secretariat had not only calculated the potential tariff revenue losses but also those that could occur if additional surcharges levied on imports were taken into account as well. Regarding the question from the delegation of Brazil, she said that the UNCTAD Secretariat had wished to include not only the tariffs, but also the other duties. That was why the Study included both an analysis of information on tariffs only and an extended analysis including other duties that could be foregone, as those other duties would not be collected either if the products were imported digitally. It had been unclear what kind of duties the WTO Moratorium included; if it was limited to tariffs or if it had a broader reach. That would probably have to be looked into in the future. As far as the products were concerned, the UNCTAD Secretariat was happy to provide delegations with the other, more detailed study and would provide further information on the different calculations and more country and commodity details. The representative of Brazil was correct in that the calculations represented upper-level potential losses and did not claim to represent actual losses today. In addition, the figures were based on 1999 actual imports.","WTCOMTDM36.pdf","UNCTAD, United, States, World, Bank, UNCTAD, UNCTAD, Secretariat, Secretariat, World, Bank, UNCTAD, Secretariat, UNCTAD, Secretariat, Brazil, UNCTAD, Secretariat, WTO, UNCTAD, Secretariat, Brazil"
"3633",3633,"72","72.      The representative of Brazil said that the issue of fiscal implications and forgone revenue was one of the issues of the report which was of interest to his delegation as well. On page 125 of the report, the study seemed to indicate that there was a consensus in the WTO regarding the Moratorium on customs duties and on any implications of that Moratorium on internal taxes. The consensus was that the Moratorium only covered tariffs, not internal taxes. Both the Geneva and the Doha Ministerial Declarations reflected that understanding. In light of that, he asked why, in the calculations of foregone revenue, the UNCTAD Secretariat had taken foregone tax revenue, in particular consumer taxes such as VAT and sales taxes into account. The Study made reference to a group of products used as the basis for the calculation of the tariff losses. It was said on page 126 that ""…a number of commodities have been selected, which traditionally have been shipped physically and been subject to border tariffs, but which today can be transformed into a digitized format and sent through the Internet"". The study made reference to a footnote, but the footnote in turn referred the reader to another study. Although some examples of the type of products were given, such as (i) printed matter; (ii) software; (iii) music and other media products; (iv) film; and (v) video games, he sought clarification as to which the products included were, with specific examples. He suggested that it would be more accurate to say that that revenue might be foregone in a context where tariffs were being levied on electronic deliveries as opposed to saying that that revenue was actually being lost.","WTCOMTDM36.pdf","Brazil, WTO, Geneva, Doha, Ministerial, Declarations, UNCTAD, Secretariat"
"3632",3632,"71","71.      The representative of the United States said that her delegation had taken note of the effects and impacts on developed and developing countries. She had found the calculations of the fiscal losses, as mentioned in the executive summary distributed, to be particularly interesting. In that connection, she noted that the draft work programme for the CTD included a seminar on the issue of fiscal implications. The CTD work programme had been initiated in 1998 and an overall WTO work programme on e-commerce had been launched under the supervision of the General Council. The mandate for the overall work had recently been renewed. Her delegation asked whether the UNCTAD calculations regarding fiscal losses were similar to the World Bank analysis on the same issue carried out two or three years back. It would be particularly interesting to see what kind of product coverage UNCTAD had used as far as including certain digital products in the calculations were concerned. She asked if any comparison had been made as to the scope of the analysis. It was                                                                                      WT/COMTD/M/36                                                                                             Page 15 interesting to note that developed countries took the larger burden due to consumption taxes and their volume of trade, as was the concern that absolute losses of tariff revenues and potential tariff revenues foregone in developing countries owed to higher tariffs applied to the digital products traded. It would be interesting to consider the possible effects of imports of digitised products over time. Developed countries were willing to recognize the gains in comparison to the losses even though there might be a concern of the level of the revenue loss.","WTCOMTDM36.pdf","United, States, CTD, CTD, WTO, General, Council, World, Bank, UNCTAD"
"3631",3631,"70","70.       The UNCTAD ""E-commerce and Development Report 2001"" contained a chapter on developments in China. China had impressive growth-rates of the number of Internet users: the rate had doubled every six months between 1997 and 2000. The mobile-phone market was also increasing rapidly. Almost 100 per cent in 2000 and China currently had the largest market in the world of mobile phone subscriptions. It had even surpassed the U.S. with 120 million subscribers. The UNCTAD report estimated that the current figure of 27 million Internet users would increase to 68 million by 2005 which was still only 5 per cent of the population. However, the growth curve would begin to flatten, while still showing growth, as had already happened in the US and in some EU countries. The IT industry already contributed 12 per cent to China's GDP growth but it was still in its infancy and there were a number of barriers that had to be tackled such as trust, business culture, Internet access costs. The lack of credit card use made on-line payment almost impossible. Language and content restrictions added additional burdens for Internet service providers in China. The gradual opening of the telecommunications and the financial sector, which both were important for the development o e-commerce, could be expected to improve the environment for e-commerce in China. It was therefore likely that further development and improvement of e-commerce in China would take place within the short to medium term.","WTCOMTDM36.pdf","UNCTAD, China, China, China, U.S., UNCTAD, US, EU, China, China, China, China"

Family members who lived abroad would order goods and services from home through the Internet. Teleservices such as remote processing (data processing, software development) and on-line call centers. A number of interesting examples of call centers were spelt out in the report. In Togo, Internet telephony had been used to get around some of the Internet access costs. A number of sectors where developing countries companies made successful use of the Internet were discussed. Some of the solutions had been to use secure servers and on-line payment facilities in other countries to allow customers to buy and make electronic payments through the Internet. That would progressively create consumer trust which was a key goal for a company to become successful on the Internet.","WTCOMTDM36.pdf","Togo"
"3628",3628,"68","68.      E-tourism was the topic of Chapter Three. It was an area that was important in e-commerce and it mainly referred to on-line bookings and reservations of flights and hotels. It was a leading sector in business-to-consumer e-commerce, because at the point of sale, the tourism product was largely an information product and was therefore ideally suited for marketing and selling over the Internet. It had been an important sector for developing countries. The UNCTAD Secretariat estimated that currently about 50 per cent of all e-commerce took place in the area of tourism and that there was good potential for increases in that sector. Developing countries only had about a 3 per cent market share in e-tourism but it was estimated that it could be increased to about 30 per cent. The chapter discussed the type of action that could be taken to increase the share of developing countries in the sector.","WTCOMTDM36.pdf","UNCTAD, Secretariat"
"3627",3627,"67","67.      The UNCTAD ""E-commerce and Development Report 2001"" also included a chapter on legal and regulatory issues. She would only mention two issues: taxation and customs duties. As far as taxation was concerned, there had been a large discussion on sales taxes and which jurisdiction should be applied for e-commerce, the one for the consumer or the one of the supplier. The current tendency seemed to be to apply the jurisdiction of the consumer, although it was not yet clear how the sales taxes would be collected from foreign suppliers in those cases. For example, there had been a debate in the European Communities regarding taxation and foreign suppliers supplying European Community consumers with goods delivered electronically were currently exempted from sales tax. With respect income tax collection from businesses, there had been discussions about how the concept of permanent establishment would apply in cyberspace with respect to e-commerce. The OECD countries had agreed that a web-server could constitute a fix place of business or permanent establishment of a company, if that company owned the server, and if the company carried on its main business activities through the server. The company would then have to pay taxes in the country of location of the server. As far as customs duties were concerned, WTO Members had extended the Moratorium on customs duties on electronically transmissions for two more years. There had been questions about the potential fiscal implications of that decision. The UNCTAD Secretariat had carried out extensive calculations at the country level. Import revenues had been calculated on digitised products (software, music, printed matters, video-products) based on 1999 imports. The value of the tariff revenue that potentially could be foregone was about 1 billion US dollars. The developing countries would have the larger share of that. If other duties were added, surcharges and WT/COMTD/M/36 Page 14 import duties such as consumption taxes on imports the value added up to a potential loss of 8 billion US dollars. In that case, developed countries would take the larger share of the loss, given their large trade volumes and high consumption taxes on the products concerned.","WTCOMTDM36.pdf","UNCTAD, European, Community, OECD, WTO, Members, UNCTAD, Secretariat"
"3626",3626,"66","66.     The macro-economic impact of e-commerce was dealt with in a separate chapter of the UNCTAD ""E-commerce and Development Report 2001"". An economic model had been used to calculate some of the implications of ICT. It was assumed that ICT would raise the productivity in the services sector. Based on that assumption, the UNCTAD Secretariat had worked with two scenarios: one in which developing countries fell behind the developed countries as far as their productivity growth in the services sector was concerned, and a second in which the developing countries caught up with the developed countries. In the second case, a productivity growth had been simulated in selected developing countries only. A number of results for different variables had been achieved. In the first scenario in which a 1 per cent productivity growth had been simulated in developed countries only, the result was that there would be negative changes in economic welfare in all developing country regions apart from Asia. Whereas in the second scenario where a 1 per cent productivity increase were simulated in selected developing countries only, positive welfare gains were noted in those regions. The 1 per cent productivity change was an arbitrary number and the figures should not be taken as absolute numbers, but rather underline the importance that new technologies can play for countries' productivity growth and its possible implications for their macro-economic indicators.","WTCOMTDM36.pdf","ICT, ICT, UNCTAD, Secretariat, Asia"
"3625",3625,"65","65.      The second chapter of the UNCTAD ""E-commerce and Development Report 2001"" looked at measuring electronic commerce. Even if many were interested in how much e-commerce there really was, most data provided by the private sector companies only provided rough estimates. Those estimates of the value of e-commerce in a given future year varied substantially depending on which source it came from. The lack of information about the value of e-commerce was a real problem. The fact that the numbers varied and the data was incomparable as they were based on different definitions and methodologies had been giving rise to an international effort towards providing guidelines which could be used for measuring e-commerce. As a result of that effort a working definition of e-commerce was available as were statistical indicators which could be used by national statistical offices. Some national offices had begun to collect e-commerce statistics. That had proven to be useful for policy makers as well as for businesses when taking decisions on investment and other policies. There was an urgent need for coordination and cooperation in the area of e-commerce statistics, in particular between those statistical offices which already had experience in measuring e-commerce with statistical offices in developing countries who wished to begin but who did not yet have experience.","WTCOMTDM36.pdf","UNCTAD"
"3624",3624,"64","64.      She said that she wished to share a few of the results of the UNCTAD ""E-commerce and Development Report 2001"" in various areas. There was a discussion on what had happened in the past year as far as the Internet market was concerned and the rise and fall of the ""dot com"" companies. One of the lessons drawn from those developments were that the economic and business implications of ICT and the Internet had to be properly understood by all players: companies, investors and consumers. The same business rules applied to the ""new economy""-companies as applied to the ""old economy""-companies. Developing countries had largely remained unaffected by those events, mainly because they had not had access to the same amount of venture capital as companies in the developed countries, especially companies in the U.S. It was an opportunity for companies in developing countries to learn from the mistakes and misconceptions that had prevailed in the past years on the Internet market. One of the conclusions drawn in the introductory chapter was that the changes brought about by ICT and e-commerce would be fundamental and lasting and that the actual benefits and the potential that the new technologies would bring were only beginning to become obvious. A main challenge ahead was related to the business culture. That was true for both developed and developing countries. Many other challenges were also discussed in the report but unless businesses changed as far as their flexibility and openness was concerned towards adopting e-commerce strategies it would be difficult to participate in the new developments.         2             http://www.unctad.org/ecommerce/docs/edr01_en.htm                                                                                   WT/COMTD/M/36                                                                                          Page 13","WTCOMTDM36.pdf","UNCTAD, ICT, U.S., ICT"

The introduction discussed the lessons learned from the previous year's ""dot com""-crisis. The first chapter treated the subject of measuring electronic commerce. The second related to e-commerce and economic growth. The following chapters were about e-tourism, e-marketplaces, e-government, legal and regulatory issues, electronic payments and logistics in the e-commerce age. Finally, there were two empirical chapters; one on e-commerce in ten LDCs and one on China.","WTCOMTDM36.pdf","LDCs, China"
"3622",3622,"62","62.       Dr. Teltscher said that that the UNCTAD ""E-commerce and Development Report 2001"" had been published the previous week. It was available on the UNCTAD Website for free download2 and delegations should have received copies through the official UN distribution system to the Geneva-based missions. If delegates still required hard copies, the UNCTAD Secretariat would be happy to provide extra copies. The overview of the report was available outside the meeting room in the three WTO languages while the main report was in English only. It was the first time that UNCTAD had considered the issue of e-commerce and development in such a comprehensive way even though UNCTAD had worked on e-commerce and Information and Communication Technologies (ICT)-related issues, particularly in the area of trade facilitation for a long time. It was a new publication which UNCTAD planned to release on an annual basis in the future. The goal with UNCTAD's work in this area, and with the report, was to assist developing countries benefit from the new technologies and that way contribute to the narrowing of the digital divide. The report should also be considered as an input into the UN Secretary General's new task force on ICTs which had held its first meeting the previous week in New York, US.","WTCOMTDM36.pdf","Teltscher, UNCTAD, UN, UNCTAD, Secretariat, WTO, UNCTAD, UNCTAD, Information, and, Communication, Technologies, UNCTAD, UNCTAD, UN, New, York, US"

"3611",3611,"52","52.     The representative of the European Communities praised the study for its analytical qualities. The points made in part V were the most important ones. The questions of utilization and utility addressed in the tables were interesting. The two should not be confused and utility is what really counts in the end. His delegation concurred with the questions put forward in part V. One of the conclusions was that preferences could be useful but that they were not always used and that one of the reasons for that was the supply-side constraints. Another reason was the one the European         1             See WT/COMTD/W/93/Corr.1.

His delegation was willing to work on the issues put forward as his delegation believed that these schemes still were useful. The Note and the conclusions that could be drawn from it were useful for the negotiations which were to begin in agriculture, industrial tariffs and regional trading agreements. All of them could benefit from a background showing how certain preferences work. In addition, the Note was also relevant for the identification of technical assistance needs and constraints of developing countries. The Note was a reminder to his delegation, as a granter of preferences, that it could still do better. The instrument which constituted the GSP would not be abandoned in the near future, it would be improved. Long discussions on preferences had also been held in other parts of the WTO and they demonstrated that preferences, if applied correctly, did work. The discussions should be led by those who used the preferences to get access to developed country markets. More comments from beneficiaries would therefore be welcome. It would be useful, if the resources of the Secretariat permitted, not only to look at the Quad countries, but also the ambitious schemes of some other countries which could be a source of future innovation and future reflection on how the GSP instrument could be used and improved.","WTCOMTDM36.pdf","GSP, WTO, Secretariat, GSP"
"3610",3610,"51","51.     The representative of the United States said that the Note, in the future, could include more information on how beneficiary countries were taking advantage of the GSP.

"3607",3607,"49","49.      The representative of Sri Lanka said that her delegation found the document a useful source of reference, particularly for developing country users of the GSP schemes. It described the schemes of the Quad countries, reviled shortcomings and suggested solutions as to how those shortcomings could be overcome. Delegations should be given more time to elaborate on the text. Her delegation therefore suggested that the item be retained on the agenda for the next formal meeting of the Committee. One conclusion that could be drawn was that the share of trade covered by the GSP compared to the share of trade covered by MFN was fairly small. Another was that few beneficiaries were using the GSP scheme effectively. One reason for that was the supply-constraints of developing countries which had led to the question of graduation and counter-graduation. In addition, when comparing the agricultural and the non-agricultural sectors, the report reviled that the utilization was higher in the industrial, non-agricultural product sector. In order to enhance the utilization of the GSP there was a need to focus on those product sectors. From the statistical part of the part of the paper showing the utilization rates, it was clear that the situation had not changed during the last couple of years. Sri Lanka's utilization rate of the United States GSP scheme was fairly high as most of the items entered duty-free. However, the actual coverage of the United States' GSP scheme had to be analyzed as certain important sectors had been excluded. Whereas the European Communities' scheme had a broader coverage, the utilization rate was lower. The reason for that was known. It was the rigid rules of origin requirements and quota restrictions. The report could be a guide of how to improve the GSP schemes. She had cited the reasons for her country's low utilization rate, however, other Members would have other explanations for their low utilization rates.","WTCOMTDM36.pdf","Sri, Lanka, GSP, Committee, GSP, MFN, GSP, Sri, Lanka, United, States, United, States, GSP, Members"

The Chairman said that at the last meeting of the Committee, Members had had before them a Note by the Secretariat entitled ""The Generalised System of Preferences: A preliminary analysis of the GSP schemes in the Quad"" contained in document WT/COMTD/W/93. That study had been prepared in response to requests from delegations for further information on the benefits of the Generalized System of Preferences.

"3605",3605,"47","47.      After the informal discussion, the Committee decided to hold further informal consultations on the issue in the near future. WT/COMTD/M/36 Page 10","WTCOMTDM36.pdf","Committee"
"3604",3604,"46","46.      As a starting-point for the discussions, he suggested that the Committee used the information provided in Document WT/COMTD/W//77/Rev.1. That document contained, amongst other things, a discussion of the operation of S&D, an illustrative list of questions, and also the nucleus of a distinction between provisions that were mandatory and those that were not. He also recalled that Ministers had instructed the CTD to take fully into consideration previous work undertaken as noted in WT/COMTD/W/77/Rev.1. Members had had that document in their possession for some time, and he was convinced that it had prompted many thoughts. He therefore urged Members to direct their comments towards taking forward the work the Committee had been mandated by Ministers to carry out. Document WT/COMTD/W/77/Rev.1 was not an exclusive basis for work. For a start, he believed that it would be useful to ask the Secretariat to assist the Committee by identifying in more depth the mandatory S&D provisions. Of course, Members were free to make their own proposals, and he recalled that Ministers had taken note of a proposal for a Framework Agreement on S&D made by a group of Members. He suggested that the Committee proceeded by holding its first discussion in informal mode. However, if any delegation wished to make a statement for the record, an opportunity to do so would be provided after the informal discussion.","WTCOMTDM36.pdf","Committee, CTD, Members, Members, Committee, Secretariat, Committee, Members, S&D, Members, Committee"
"3603",3603,"45","45.      He went on to recall that the work the CTD carried out was without prejudice to that carried out in respect of implementation by other WTO bodies. In that connection he drew delegations' attention to the fact that other WTO bodies would be carrying out work on specific S&D provisions, either under the mandate handed to them by the Decision on Implementation-Related Issues and Concerns, or as part of their treatment of outstanding implementation issues under paragraph 12 of the Ministerial Declaration. He would be seeking the guidance of Members, as the work progressed, on how to coordinate the work done in the CTD with that done elsewhere, in order to meet the CTD mandate, and to avoid duplication of efforts. Regarding how the CTD approached the substance of its work, he suggested that the meeting focussed in particular on that part of the mandate contained in paragraph (i), of the work programme, which instructed the CTD to do the following three things, and then to report to the General Council with clear recommendations for a decision by July 2002. Those three things were:         •       to identify those special and differential treatment provisions that were already                 mandatory in nature and those that were non-binding in character;         •       to consider the legal and practical implications for developed and developing                 Members of converting special and differential treatment measures into mandatory                 provisions; and         •       to identify those that Members consider should be made mandatory.","WTCOMTDM36.pdf","WTO, WTO, Members, CTD, CTD, CTD, CTD, General, Council, Members, Members"
"3602",3602,"44","44.      The Chairman said that the issue of Special and Differential Treatment (S&D) had been given a new departure in the Doha Ministerial Declaration, to which the CTD had to respond urgently. As reflected in paragraph 44 of the Ministerial Declaration (WT/MIN(01)DEC/1), Ministers had agreed that that all S&D provisions should be reviewed with a view to strengthening them and making them more precise, effective and operational. In that connection, they had endorsed the work programme contained in Paragraph 12 of the Decision on Implementation-Related Issues and                                                                                   WT/COMTD/M/36                                                                                           Page 9 Concerns (WT/MIN(01)/17), also adopted at Doha. Copies of the text of the work programme on S&D were available at the back of the room. As delegations would have noted, two aspects of the work programme had firm deadlines instructing the CTD to report to the General Council with clear recommendations for a decision by July 2002. It was therefore critically important to commence the work immediately and that Members considered how they wished to organize the work. Only three formal Committee meetings had been scheduled before the end of July 2002. It would therefore be necessary to schedule a number of informal meetings, in addition to the formal meetings, if the CTD wished to make good progress. In principle, he proposed to call one informal meeting a month in order to ensure progress on S&D. However, that programme might have to be varied according to the progress made.","WTCOMTDM36.pdf","Chairman, CTD, Doha, CTD, General, Council, Members, Committee, CTD"

More time was needed to get a better sense of what the exercise was about. The CTD should consider what the next steps were as far as a WTO contribution was concerned. Even if it was to be a factual listing, Members would need to say what that factual listing would be.","WTCOMTDM36.pdf","United, States, CTD, WTO, Members"
"3591",3591,"34","34.     The representative of the European Communities said that with respect to what the representative of Paraguay had said, it was not a question of an interpretation of the WTO declaration. The idea was to give persons who prepare for FFD, a tool, showing them what had been done at Doha on the issues in the FFD process. For example, the Facilitator and others had raised the issue of WT/COMTD/M/36 Page 8 Market access. The market access sections of the Doha Declaration could then be quoted. He understood that some delegations were uneasy about what the proposal actually meant and how it could be done, so he agreed to the Chair's suggestion to continue the discussion informally. However, the Committee should not wait too long since the PrepCom meeting was in January 2002.","WTCOMTDM36.pdf","European, Communities, Paraguay, WTO, Doha, Committee"
"3590",3590,"33","33.     At this point in the discussion, the Chairman reminded the meeting that there were two proposals: the proposal of the representative of the European Communities and a proposal to send the factual documents which were previously indicated - the Ministerial Declaration, the Decision on Implementation-Related Issues and Concerns, the Declaration on TRIPS and Public Health, the Decision on Extensions under Article 27.4 of the Subsidies Agreement, and the Decision on the EU/ACP Waiver - without any comment, duly notifying them of the decisions taken. The latter proposal did not seem to raise any problems. There was also a proposal to update the PrepCom on progress in the preparation of the setting up of the WTO TNC. He hoped that that this could be agreed. With respect to the proposal made by the representative of the EC, he noted that although there had not been opposition, it has been agreed that further discussion was necessary. The Committee could consult later on how to proceed on that issue. No decision could be taken at that moment.","WTCOMTDM36.pdf","Chairman, European, Communities, Public, Health, WTO, TNC, EC, Committee"
"3589",3589,"32","32.     The representative of Paraguay found that the proposal risked interpreting the Doha Declaration. That was why such a proposal had to be taken with caution and judiciousness. He agreed with the representative of Canada that it should be much more a question of looking at ways to supplement the Doha Declaration, but the Committee should not look for ways of interpreting what had actually been stated in the Doha Declaration, as that would be dangerous.","WTCOMTDM36.pdf","Paraguay, Canada, Committee"
"3588",3588,"31","31.      The representative of Japan indicated there seemed to be a lot of capacity building and similar supporting activities included in the Declaration, and the WTO had to work with the other international, regional and bilateral donors to implement those activities. He therefore wished to see the proposed paper, if such a paper was prepared, include the good collaboration and cooperation in a coherent manner to work toward the common target of development. He supported the advantage expressed by previous speakers that supply-side capacity constraints, including infrastructure hardware with regard to trade, had to be tackled in a coordinated manner. The WTO was not accustomed to doing that all alone. Wording with respect to further cooperation and collaboration therefore had to be included.","WTCOMTDM36.pdf","Japan, WTO, WTO"
"3587",3587,"30","30.     The respresentative of the United States said that her delegation would welcome an informal discussion on what the list may entail, since her delegation might not necessarily share the views of certain other delegations, although it would probably share some of the indications coming from the representative of Canada, especially with respect to the supply-side requirements and the linkages that would be found in the International Conference. She also found some of the comments by the representative of Argentina interesting. She did not wish to re-draft the WTO Declaration and Decisions, which had been negotiated intensively in Doha.","WTCOMTDM36.pdf","United, States, Canada, Argentina, WTO, Doha"

The representative of Argentina, indicated that there might be certain costs for developing countries from the Doha Declaration, and the proposed factual report should not lose sight of them it was to give a balanced picture of the situation. That had to be further considered, so they were not in a position to come up with an analysis at that time.","WTCOMTDM36.pdf","Argentina"
"3584",3584,"28","28.      The representative of Canada indicated that the proposal did not cause them any problem. It was a good proposal, although some concerns might need to be worked out. It was a good idea to indicate succinctly what could be done within the confines of the WTO and what went beyond that. It should be indicated, where linkages were necessary, and where the coherence agenda would have to come into play, to make it clear that the World Bank, IMF and other organisations would be drawn into certain of the supply-side considerations in particular.","WTCOMTDM36.pdf","Canada, WTO, World, Bank, IMF"
"3583",3583,"27","27.     The representative of the European Communities indicated that the idea was to ask the WTO Secretariat to draw up a more succinct report of what had happened in Doha, rather than just sending the Fourth Ministerial Declaration. The proposed report would make clear where the elements that had been identified so far in the FFD discussion were addressed in the Declaration. The major part would be on technical assistance and capacity building because there were so many firm commitments to be followed-up. It was also worth noting that many of the other substantive points which the Facilitator and others had raised which would be the elements which would really be conclusive to financing development by using trade means, such as better market access. For example, it could be stated that the question of market access had been addressed and that the WTO had a commitment to negotiate further. What the specific commitments were in the Least-Developed Countries (LDC) section of the Declaration, could also be pointed out. That would enable a reader to have a succinct and comprehensive overview of what the relevant commitments undertaken in the Declaration were and that would assist the New York based FFD process. The aim would not be to push anyone into a negotiating position. It was a fact that the WTO had agreed to strengthen the rules for example, and the language that was in the WTO Ministerial declaration paragraph on rules, did make reference to certain disciplines.

"3582",3582,"26","26.       The representative from the United States asked exactly what the representative of the EC had suggested. References had been made to anti-dumping and other elements, when the development of the trade section of the paper on FFD was being described. The proposal needed to be discussed more, informally, for all to get a better idea what they would be agreeing to with respect to the illustrative list proposed.","WTCOMTDM36.pdf","United, States, EC"
"3581",3581,"25","25.     He therefore proposed that, as a first step, the CTD as the official point of contact for the FFD process, should send copies of the Ministerial Declaration, the Decision on Implementation-Related Issues and Concerns, the Declaration on TRIPS and Public Health, the Decision on extensions under Article 27.4 of the Subsidies Agreement, and the Decision on the EU/ACP Waiver, to the Co-Chairs of the FFD Preparatory Committee for the information of the Preparatory Committee at its next meeting in January 2002. He further proposed that at the January 2002 meeting of the PrepCom, the WTO Secretariat and himself could update the PrepCom on developments in Geneva since 26 November 2001, in particular on steps towards the creation of a Trade Negotiations Committee (TNC). At the January 2002 Preparatory Committee meeting, it would be open to any Member to state their views concerning the Work Programme of the WTO and the contribution that it might make towards FFD. He reminded the Members of the EU's proposal, which had been endorsed by Switzerland, for the Secretariat to undertake work on areas in which cooperation should continue, and enquired whether Members would be agreeable to that process.","WTCOMTDM36.pdf","CTD, Public, Health, FFD, Preparatory, Committee, Preparatory, Committee, WTO, Secretariat, Geneva, Trade, Negotiations, Committee, TNC, Preparatory, Committee, Member, Work, Programme, WTO, Members, EU, Switzerland, Secretariat, Members"
"3580",3580,"24","24.    The Chairman recalled that earlier in 2001, the CTD had sent a contribution to the Preparatory Committee, contained in document WT/COMTD/30, and that at that time, the WTO had been working towards the Doha Ministerial Conference. The WTO was currently in a new situation: the Ministerial Declaration and Decisions had been adopted; the decision on the extension of transition periods for subsidies had been taken; and the waiver of GATT 1994 for the EU/ACP Cotonou Convention had been adopted.. The WTO had a clear work programme of negotiations and other work which would take it through to 2005. In addition, the WTO had admitted China and Chinese Taipei as Members.","WTCOMTDM36.pdf","Chairman, CTD, Preparatory, Committee, WTO, WTO, GATT, WTO, WTO, China, Taipei, Members"
"3579",3579,"23","23.      The representative of the European Communities proposed that, to get the ""good news of Doha"" into the UN process, in addition to meetings held in Geneva and New York, the WTO Secretariat could be asked to briefly look in a factual way, at what had been decided that was relevant to the themes of the International Conference. Such a factual paper would indicate for each item in the FFD, how it was concretely addressed in the Doha Declaration, what the commitment was, and what the WTO Membership had agreed to do. This would ensure that the decisions and ideas from Doha were included in the process and that the WTO had something to say on the elements of the FFD process, be it reinforcing or complementary to the political objectives which all WTO members shared. His delegation would therefore propose going beyond the recommendation in the WTO Secretariat's background note provided in paragraph 29, and not only make an intervention on the results of Doha, but provide a factual analysis, aimed at putting together the elements which were already in the Facilitator's draft outcome document and other papers which had come out from the FFD process, and point out how the developments that have come out of Doha were relevant. The idea was to give the persons who had to decide on concrete action and concrete commitments in the WT/COMTD/M/36 Page 6 FFD process a solid basis to do so, without having to read the whole WTO Declaration in order to find the all the sections/paragraphs on one issue. The WTO Secretariat, possibly under its own responsibility, could be tasked to sum up and provide such a paper to the Conference.

"3578",3578,"22","22.     His delegation was of the view that developments emerging from Doha should be reflected and followed-up in the FFD Ministerial Declaration with concrete pointers saying, ""we note and take note again of these commitments, and we will do our part these commitments are followed-up, that the money is there, that the political commitment is shared by our governments in this Conference, as well as those who went to Doha."" In the area of technical assistance, which was an important area with respect to the financing question, the delegate went on to state that the facilitator's draft outcome document called for multilateral and bilateral donors to work on the issue. The WTO Ministerial declaration also called for coherence in this field.","WTCOMTDM36.pdf","Doha, Doha, WTO"
"3577",3577,"21","21.      He drew attention to the trade part - and to a lesser extent to the development, debt and other issues parts - of the existing facilitator's draft outcome document and indicated that there were many points that were already made and could be reinforced and made more concrete after Doha. For example, the draft outcome document started with the general message that trade liberalisation was a useful tool. This however, needed to be re-modelled, as it was not just any type of trade liberalisation but was very specific. The draft outcome document went on to consider anti-dumping, and the strengthening of rules and disciplines – things that the WTO had decided to do in the Ministerial declaration. The document also mentioned further liberalisation of trade in agricultural products – the WTO had a firm, new mandate for the agricultural negotiations. The reduction of tariff peaks which affect developing countries exports was also mentioned in the document – the WTO had concrete non-agricultural market access negotiations coming up, including some analytical work on exactly what it meant for developing countries. In addition, the draft outcome document referred to textiles and trade and health – again, the WTO had a declaration on these issues coming out of Doha. The document also discussed regional trade integration, on which there was a negotiating mandate within the WTO for better rules. The document also addressed market access (the Everything But Arms initiative) and the issue of coherence, among many others. In the area of investment, the draft outcome document looked at how to ensure that developing countries have a capacity, and that the international system should be responsive to the fostering private investment flows. The Fourth Ministerial Declaration again gave the WTO a mandate to look at rules in this area.","WTCOMTDM36.pdf","Doha, WTO, WTO, WTO, WTO, Doha, WTO, WTO"
"3576",3576,"20","20.     The Conference would also be expected to be complementary in areas where the WTO could not deliver all the promises in the Doha Declaration on its own. This was especially with respect to technical assistance and capacity-building, where many of the commitments in the Doha declaration could only be delivered with the help of Members development agencies or Ministries and Ministries of Foreign Affairs. Policy consistency and follow-up were necessary, in addition to strong political commitment, to ensure that what had been agreed to at Doha came into effect. This was not only true for technical assistance and capacity building, but for the substantive contributions which were mentioned in the Facilitator's first draft outcome document and other reports from the preparatory process.","WTCOMTDM36.pdf","WTO, Doha, Members, Doha"
"3575",3575,"2","2.       The Chairman introduced the draft Agenda for the meeting, contained in airgram WTO/AIR/1661/Rev.1 of 23 November 2001. He said that it was his intention to only have one discussion on special and differential treatment under agenda item D. He therefore suggested that the two sub-items under agenda item D be merged and that the Secretariat document be used as a starting-point for the discussions on the work programme on special and differential treatment contained in the decision on implementation related issues and concerns adopted by Ministers in Doha. He recalled that Ministers had instructed the CTD to take fully into consideration previous work undertaken as noted in WT/COMTD/W/77/Rev.1.","WTCOMTDM36.pdf","Chairman, Secretariat, Doha, CTD"
"3574",3574,"19","19.     The representative of the European Communities agreed that the Conference was an important event which should be seen in the perspective of the important work that the WTO was trying to commence after Doha. He said he wished to ensure that the WTO had some messages for the Ambassador to take to New York in order to achieve an optimum result of the Conference. He acknowledged that the Members had channels in New York to do so, but was of the view that it was appropriate to have discussions at the WTO, given the past involvement of the WTO and also the future approach which the CTD had been informed about. The WTO had played an important role in the process. The questions outlined in the background note were pertinent, and outlined how his delegation saw the follow-up to Doha developing. The most important point was that the Conference was a platform to consolidate, reinvigorate and make known to a broader constituency outside the trade world, the results – namely, the development dimension of the Doha Declaration - which was innovative, new, and much more development-oriented than before.

Ambassador Jacoby went on to indicate that the next meeting of the PrepCom of the FFD process would take place in mid-January 2002 for two weeks, and it was presumed to be the last PrepCom meeting, before the actual Conference. It would definitely be the last formal PrepCom, but it was possible that there would be some intersessional last minute drafting exercises before March 2002, and a lot of work was on-going. The Facilitator, who had prepared a first draft of an Outcome document which was circulated to the CTD at its last meeting, was working on a revised draft after having received comments from members during the last PrepCom meeting. This revised document would be discussed again at the January 2002 meeting.","WTCOMTDM36.pdf","Ambassador, Jacoby, CTD"

Ms. Ruth Jacoby, Ambassador, Permanent Mission of Sweden to the UN, congratulated the WTO membership on the results of Doha and indicated that she was impressed and encouraged by the results that had been achieved. Members of the WTO should have been proud. The last PrepCom had been held in October 2001 and had brought about many discussions and negotiations. She felt encouraged by a number of things that had happened since that PrepCom meeting. One was the Ministerial Conference in Doha, and another was the meetings of the Development Committee and the International Monetary and Financial Committee (IMFC) recently held in Ottawa (17-18 November 2001), where Ministers of Finance and Ministers of Development Cooperation had agreed on two Communiqués, one of which she felt was particularly forward looking and represented the latest, most authoritative view on the trends of world development and the direction to be taken. Those two important Ministerial meetings had set the parameters and framework for substantially moving forward the common agenda of development and improvements in standards of living in the developing countries, in the coming months. That was encouraging.","WTCOMTDM36.pdf","Ruth, Jacoby, Ambassador, Permanent, Mission, of, Sweden, UN, WTO, Doha, Members, WTO, Doha, Development, Committee, International, Monetary, and, Financial, Committee, Ottawa, Communiqués"

He apologised for the paper not being translated into the three languages but indicated that translation would soon be available. The paper aimed to give an accurate description of the process, the PrepCom and WTO's involvement in the process. The key issues raised in the note were contained in paragraph 30 on Page 5, and governed the interrelationship between what would happen in Geneva following Doha, and the ongoing process in New York in the lead up to the Monterrey Conference. Four questions were raised in this regard: (1) How can the FFD process contribute to the furthering of the results of the Doha declaration? (2) How can elements of the Doha declaration be incorporated into the discussions on FFD? (3) How should the two institutions of the WTO and UN best cooperate in the future, especially in this regard? and (4) How can individual members ensure that trade and development issues are treated in a consistent manner within the two processes? The Secretariat thought that it was important to maintain consistency in the flow of information between New York and Geneva in the process leading to the Conference in Monterrey in 2002. He hoped that some of the questions would be used as a background to the informal discussions to be held with Ambassador Jacoby later on.

The Director of the Development Division stated that the WTO had been involved through the Membership and at Secretariat-level in the various stages of the preparatory process for the FFD Conference. The WTO was recognised as a major institutional stakeholder in the preparatory process for the Conference, which was to be held in Monterrey, Mexico in March 2002. He reiterated that Deputy Director-General Mr. Ablassé Ouedraogo and Mr. Alain Frank had attended the most recent PrepCom held in mid-October 2001. He went on to note that the October 2001 PrepCom meeting had been held before the Doha Ministerial. Doha was a watershed that made a difference in the WTO's approach to the FFD Conference, since WTO Members had now agreed to a Ministerial Declaration. At the October 2001 PrepCom meeting, the main item on the agenda had been the draft Outcome of the Facilitator, which had been distributed at the last CTD session. According to reports he had received, there had been substantive and lively discussion on the draft Outcome, which was to be revised and reissued at the end of November 2001.

At this meeting, the Committee had the honour of the company of Ambassador Ruth Jacoby, who was Ambassador at the Permanent Mission of Sweden to the UN, and one of the Co-Chairs of the Bureau to the Preparatory Committee (PrepCom) for the Conference. She had come to the CTD to discuss preparations for the Conference under sub-item (ii). However, he first informed the Committee, that since its last meeting in October, the PrepCom had held a meeting in New York at which the WTO had been represented by the Deputy Director-General, Mr. Ablassé Ouedraogo and Mr. Alain Frank, Director, External Relations. The Secretariat was invited to inform the Committee of the latest developments in the UN process from a WTO perspective, and to introduce the new background note by the Secretariat contained in document WT/COMTD/W/94 of 21 November 2001.

Finally, as I stated at the beginning of this paper, while considerable progress has been made in Panama in isolated cases, coordinated efforts have not shown the same progress.

Various State entities offer a number of online services and facilitate their work through electronic media, the most significant of which are the Panama Canal Authority, whose website offers detailed information on procurement of goods and services for the Panama Canal, and the Ministry of the Economy and Finance, whose website not only provides information, but also enables taxpayers to send their tax returns by magnetic media (although physical payment is still required). It is also worth mentioning that March of this year, saw the introduction of an Internet-based system called SICE (Integrated Foreign Trade System), which replaced SIDUNEA. SICE connects institutions involved in foreign trade, offering the possibility of preparing customs declarations and obtaining, online, most of the documentation relating to import customs transactions (including licences) which previously had to be obtained from different institutions. This system was created only recently, so that it is still not possible to complete the entire process online.

Thus, the costs of unlimited internet access service providers remain reasonable, depending on the user (residential or business) and the technology used (dial-up, cable modem, cable data etc.).

For example, medium-income users have rapid and efficient access (average connection speed of 56K) through digital exchanges set up at certain locations in the country.

The subject was important and the documents provided to delegations were essentially in English which made it difficult for French- and Spanish-speaking delegations to work on and understand the document. Nevertheless, her delegation had made an attempt to study it. She informed Members that her Government had integrated trade into its Poverty Reduction Strategy. That was why Guinea was suited for the second phase of the pilot scheme of the IF. WTO technical assistance was directed towards making Members understand the rules and principles of the organization. That was why particular importance should be attached to the question of financing of technical assistance and why the financing had to be predictable and included in the regular budget of the WTO. Her delegation was pleased to see that some of the questions her delegation had raised with the Secretariat had been taken up in the Strategy such as cooperation with universities in developing countries on questions related to the WTO and the training of trainers in developing countries. Those were vital issues for people in developing countries to understand the WTO. However, her delegation was concerned with what was stated regarding modern information technologies. She asked how the WTO intended to hold on-line courses for participants in countries where information technology was scarce. For example there was only one reference centre in her ministry. Her delegation also wondered how the countries listed in the table on the IF in Section V of the Coordinated WTO Plan for Technical Assistance Activities had been selected. All LDCs had more or less the same needs. Apart from that, her delegation was satisfied with the new Strategy and hoped that it would be applied with the participation of all Members and that appropriate funding would be forthcoming in order for the objectives to be reached.","WTCOMTDM35.pdf","Guinea, Members, Guinea, WTO, Members, WTO, Secretariat, WTO, WTO, WTO, Members"
"3529",3529,"98","98.      The representative of Indonesia said that the Strategy provided a clear approach of the WTO Secretariat to technical assistance. Although his delegation agreed with much in the Strategy, a couple of aspects had to be kept in mind in the implementation for it to achieve its objectives. The problems and challenges faced by developing countries differed from one country to another and had become deeper and broader in nature. No ""one-size-fits-all"" approach to technical assistance for developing countries was applicable. It was therefore imperative that, before embarking on any technical assistance programme, both the WTO and the beneficiary countries, conducted problem identification. That would ensure that the technical assistance provided by the WTO would be tailored to the specific problems and needs of the developing countries or regions. The essence of any technical assistance was to help developing countries, not only to implement the WTO Agreements, but also to derive benefits from them. Only by adopting such a problem-oriented approach could developing countries reap the full benefits of the liberalized trading system. Although his delegation supported increased funding for technical assistance, it should not burden the share of the developing countries' contribution.

However, it was noted that the new Strategy provided for technical assistance to regions. However, the new Strategy should also recognize the need of individual countries within regions as each country had its own needs and requirements for technical assistance. The WTO technical assistance had to respond to supply-side constraints through inter-agency collaboration. The current financing through the regular budget was inadequate. Her delegation supported a multi-year funding programme to give predictability and stability to the process. The new Strategy should accord prominence to paragraph 9 which referred to technical assistance delivered in Geneva. The Secretariat should endeavour to quantify the assistance with a view to identifying how it could be expanded. Lastly, Trade Policy Reviews were critical aspects of technical assistance and capacity building. The intervals between reviews were too long. For example, for countries such as Jamaica, Trade-Policy Reviews occurred every six years. That issue had to be addressed to see how the integration of the Trade-Policy Reviews could be carried out in a constructive manner.","WTCOMTDM35.pdf","Jamaica, WTO, Geneva, Secretariat, Jamaica, Trade-Policy, Reviews"

"3526",3526,"95","95.     The representative of Japan said that the Strategy covered and responded to many of the concerns raised in previous meetings. His delegation endorsed the Strategy. The first of his delegation's three concerns related to the fact that the WTO could not undertake everything. There were several dimensions to the development of a developing country, but the WTO was not the main executing agency for technical assistance and only covered a limited part of the whole picture of development. His delegation wished to see the WTO play an active part in mainstreaming trade into the development strategies of each country. In order to do that the WTO had to strengthen its coordination with other international organizations and bilateral donors. Second, his delegation was happy to note the new WTO unit for technical cooperation audit and wished to see the positive feedback from the outcome of auditing and monitoring. Third, there seemed to be some concern regarding the predictability of technical assistance funding. Several Members had raised the possibility to increase the regular budget. His Government wished to study that option, but as had been mentioned earlier, the WTO was not an executing agency for technical assistance. There were a certain amount of contributions on a voluntary basis to several trust funds. His delegation wished to see predictable funding by also utilising other resources.","WTCOMTDM35.pdf","Japan, WTO, WTO, WTO, WTO, WTO, Members, WTO"
"3525",3525,"94","94.      The representative of Turkey said that he first had a comment regarding the allocation of priorities regarding the available technical assistance resources of the Secretariat. It was not surprising that the new Strategy gave high priority to the LDCs. His delegation had always been in favour of giving high priority for LDCs in technical assistance. However, that should be without prejudice to the rights of other developing countries. At least the current level of technical assistance provided to developing countries should not be reduced, and when possible, should be increased. The language of paragraph 15 did not fully address the specific concern of his delegation. Second, with respect to Annex V, he said that his delegation wished to see an explicit reference to two important regional organizations operating in his country's region: the Organization of the Black Sea Economic Cooperation and the Economic Cooperation Organization. The Secretariat had been working closely WT/COMTD/M/35 Page 24 with those two organizations and his delegation had been happy to see the fruitful results of that cooperation and was confident that the cooperation would continue in the future. It was therefore appropriate to make a clear reference to them in Annex V.","WTCOMTDM35.pdf","Turkey, Secretariat, LDCs, Organization, of, the, Black, Sea, Economic, Cooperation, Economic, Cooperation, Organization, Secretariat"
"3524",3524,"93","93.      The representative of Peru said that it was important that the Strategy be financed. Even if a strategy were designed with deadlines and review mechanisms, it would not bring many benefits unless it was financed. That was of utmost importance as it was part of the concerns of developing countries in connection with a possible new round of negotiations. Section II of the document contained the right approaches. The ten core elements constituted a comprehensive strategy. The mainstreaming mechanism and its application was important in order to include technical assistance and capacity building at the national level. Efforts had been made in Peru with respect to the institutionalization of focal points and the creation of a national coordinating committee. A national commission with participation of both the public and the private sectors had been set up. Its mandate was to disseminate information, make broad policy guidelines and above all train businessmen, academics as well as government employees on WTO matters. The follow-up of the benefits of technical assistance was important as it was a means to improve and contribute to the improvement of technical assistance. Specific approaches on the basis of subjects or regions were worthwhile as they would lead to the application of technical assistance taking into account the characteristics and the special needs of each member. His delegation therefore supported the training of trainers who would become sources of information and dissemination on the rules and commitments which countries required within the WTO. These together with distance learning and appropriate links with academic institutions would have a positive multiplier effect. He therefore hoped that these elements would be included in the Annex relating to the Latin American and Caribbean countries. His delegation generally supported the Strategy and would continue improve on it.","WTCOMTDM35.pdf","Peru, Peru, WTO, WTO, Caribbean"
"3523",3523,"92","92.      The representative of Rwanda said that his delegation generally was satisfied with the Strategy and particularly with the integrated approach, with the cooperation activities with higher institutions of learning in the concerned countries as well as with the training of trainers. However, his delegation had three comments. First, the new Strategy had to be financed through the regular budget. In addition, it was necessary, at least for the LDCs, to get the technical assistance, starting with the permanent missions in Geneva. Third, the essential elements of the Strategy should be reflected in the Declaration of the Fourth Ministerial Conference.","WTCOMTDM35.pdf","Rwanda, Geneva"
"3522",3522,"91","91.     The representative of Egypt said that his delegation welcomed the new Strategy and was prepared to take note of it in the Committee and move ahead with implementation while at the same time continue to upgrade an improve on it. It was important to reconfirm that the overarching objective of WTO technical assistance activities was to increase developing countries' share of world trade. When the technical assistance activities contributed to efforts aiming at achieving that goal, they would have successfully fulfilled their purpose. Everything in the new Strategy should be seen in that context: objectives and purposes referred to in the document should be tools and means to achieve that objective. One of the key fundamentals necessary to ensure effective implementation of the new Strategy was availability of resources on a stable basis. His delegation therefore supported the call in paragraph 4 for increased and predictable resources. The regular budget was the best means to ensure predictability while maintaining and regularly raising voluntary contributions, in addition to the needed regular resources, would provide sufficient increased resources. The various approaches listed in paragraph 6 were not and should not be mutually exclusive. That was stated in the following paragraph. However, the tools-box which grouped the various approaches should be given increased visibility, not only in the provision of technical assistance activities, but also in the evaluation of the distribution and effectiveness of those activities to all beneficiaries. That approach would also help the coordination discussed in Section III. With respect to Section III he said that mainstreaming of trade into the national development policies was an important concept that might play a role in yielding better results. However, it was necessary to underline that the mainstreaming exercise had primarily to be at the national level, in order to fit correctly in the context of the national policies and objectives. The first bullet under paragraph 8 emphasised the linkage between technical assistance and mainstreaming from an angle that his delegation believed should be dealt with in a different way. Referring to the fourth indent under the seventh bullet of paragraph 8, he said that the                                                                                     WT/COMTD/M/35                                                                                            Page 23 newly established Management Committee would, according to its terms of reference, invite Members, as necessary, to coordinate the delivery of technical assistance. He requested the Secretariat to provide Members with the terms of reference of the Management Committee. Based on the study of those terms of reference, it might be worthwhile to request the Secretariat to submit periodic reports on the work of the TAMC. Annex IV dealt with the Arab States and he suggested that the Economic Commission for Africa be included in its paragraph 43 which related to a MoU since many countries belonging to the North African Region would fall under the ECA and not under ESQUA, although ESQUA had a somewhat different mandate. As an editorial point he suggested that Djibouti be added to the footnote on page 17 as well as to paragraph 46 where the number of Arab States should be increased from 10 to 11. Finally, his delegation welcomed the willingness shown by the Secretariat in paragraph 47, to increase the volume and improve the quality of its technical assistance to other countries and hoped that that willingness would be transformed into practical and concrete activities.","WTCOMTDM35.pdf","Egypt, Committee, WTO, Management, Committee, Members, Secretariat, Members, Committee, Secretariat, TAMC, Arab, States, Economic, Commission, Africa, North, African, Region, ECA, ESQUA, Djibouti, Secretariat"
"3521",3521,"90","90.     He went on to say that another observation his delegation had made was that the Strategy gave the impression that mainstreaming was a core WTO responsibility. It was mainly the countries themselves and other international organizations which dealt with that. The WTO could contribute and had to be conscious of it but could not drive the process. That was for others do to. The statement that the WTO technical assistance seeks ""to mainstream trade priority areas of action into national development plans…"" was somewhat too ambitious for what the WTO could do. It was nevertheless important that there was awareness of the concept and that work was done to make WTO action complementary in the field. Where do we go from here was the most important question and how the WTO would cooperate with international and regional organizations beyond the formalistic point of Memoranda of Understanding (MoUs) and the IF which were mentioned in the document. How the Strategy would be followed-up within the Secretariat was another important question. A Technical Assistance Management Committee (TAMC) had been established but delegations did not know how that Committee prepared the one-year plan. He wondered if everything had been cleared within that Committee and how the self-coordinated WTO Secretariat Annual Plan had been put together as it did not indicate why the various elements had been chosen and where the priorities came from. Some short justification for the individual projects in line with the Strategy and the objectives would be useful for transparency reasons. That would convince delegations that internal Secretariat coordination was functioning. Otherwise, the one-year plan only looked like a shortened version of the Strategy and that was not what it was supposed to be. He wished to hear the Secretariat representatives explain how follow-up and implementation were supposed to be handled. Paragraph 20 mentioned a review. That review should not only concern the Strategy but, above all, its implementation and the feed-back the Secretariat might wish to take from implementation back into the Strategy. Nevertheless, it was work in progress. The theory and principles should not be discussed forever. A great deal had been achieved with the Strategy and WTO technical cooperation should move forward, but delegations' comments should help to constantly improve it.","WTCOMTDM35.pdf","WTO, WTO, WTO, WTO, WTO, WTO, MoUs, Secretariat, Technical, Assistance, Management, Committee, Committee, Committee, WTO, Secretariat, Secretariat, Secretariat, Secretariat, WTO"

The representative of the European Communities gave the view, that as far as the Organization Internationale de la Francophonie (OIF) was concerned the CTD should show flexibility and allow it ad-hoc observer status. The OIF was already working together with the WTO on technical assistance matters, was represented in Geneva and could actually be present at meetings.","WTCOMTDM35.pdf","European, Communities, Organization, Internationale, de, la, Francophonie, CTD, WTO, Geneva"
"3519",3519,"89","89.      The representative of European Communities said that it was easier to criticize a strategy than to draw one up. Work on the Strategy had been ongoing for a year and that his delegation had been active in the debate and fed in ideas, not only because they were major donors in the field, but because they believed that they would be even more so if there was a coherent strategy. If EC member states had to convince their Finance Ministries to contribute even more money to technical assistance to trade-related matters, within or outside WTO, a coherent strategy in the WTO was part of the evidence that had to be brought forward to convince them. Following an intensive debate internally, the EC had no opposition to take note of the Strategy and use it as a basis for further work. Members had to be practical so the work could progress. The paper was not perfect and it would never be so no matter how long it was discussed. He had a number of comments regarding where his delegation wished to see the process going. The Secretariat had to concentrate on implementation. First, the paper was called a Strategy, but it was largely also a description and other things. It was not a strategy where the objectives and means were clearly set out with time frames for implementation. His delegation recognized how difficult it was to put such a paper together, but took the paper as the document that described the objectives, pointed out the approaches and means available. His delegation was happy that mainstreaming had been recognized as a main point, that the roles Trade Policy Reviews could play had been highlighted in a more satisfactory way, that bilateral and international coordination had been taken up and that the question of monitoring and evaluation were part of the integrated concept, together with the ongoing changes in the Secretariat to improve its administrative structure. What was less clear was how the approaches matched the objectives. One question was how the Secretariat would act when there were contradictory approaches on certain issues and if there were ways to get around such situations. Agreement-by-Agreement approaches was for the rules implementation but not for all of technical assistance and capacity building. Those WT/COMTD/M/35 Page 22 types of points had to be worked out in more detail. The questions of whether there would be an implementation plan or a work-programme to follow up and how delegations would be able to see that the well intentioned and ably put down points would influence the day-to-day work.","WTCOMTDM35.pdf","European, Communities, EC, WTO, WTO, EC, Members, Secretariat, Secretariat, Secretariat"
"3518",3518,"88","88.      The representative of the United States said that the new Strategy was useful in the efforts to increase the effectiveness of technical cooperation through coordination with bilateral and multilateral development partners. While his delegation was opposed to more funding out of the regular budget, his delegation had heard the issue of predictability and had done much on technical assistance with funding to the IF Trust Fund, the WTO Global Trust Fund and Africa Initiative Funds to the WTO directly. His delegation encouraged the WTO Secretariat to focus on the Agreement by Agreement approach to technical cooperation and capacity building as it was where the WTO had a well- established comparative advantage. Regarding the Coordinated WTO Plan for Technical Assistance, he said that it could increase the effectiveness of WTO technical assistance and coordination with bilateral and multilateral development partners. He encouraged the Secretariat to see that the Plan was given as wide a distribution as possible.","WTCOMTDM35.pdf","United, States, WTO, WTO, WTO, Secretariat, WTO, WTO, WTO, Secretariat"
"3517",3517,"87","87.     The representative of Switzerland said that his delegation basically agreed with the approach presented in the paper. The paper gave a comprehensive view integrating all areas and divisions dealing with technical assistance in the WTO and all actors involved its the delivery of technical assistance. The paper outlined a process-oriented approach which could eventually replace the current approach dominated to a large extent by ad-hoc requests. Crucial elements for the working of the Strategy would be the functioning of national contact points, who first had to be committed to elaborating integrated national plans for implementing the WTO Agreements, and secondly had to be committed to take the idea of mainstreaming seriously. While the Strategy was good in theory it was not clear how it would be implemented in practice. One question related to whether there would be some kind of implementation plan on how to evolve in direction of the mainstreaming process. Another was whether there would be any kind of sequencing, for example to start the implementation with a number of pilot countries, or regions only. A third question was whether there were any concrete plans with regard to coordination with the donors. A more general question related to the next steps, after the document had been taken note of, with a view to put the Strategy into practice.","WTCOMTDM35.pdf","Switzerland, WTO, WTO"
"3516",3516,"86","86.      The representative of Canada said that her delegation thought the document really was a strategic paper. It was not perfect and might require some further work along the lines suggested by the representative of Zambia. However, it had properly situated WTO activities within the context of national development plans, which was critical, and in collaboration with multilateral and bilateral donors' assistance strategies. The WTO could not undertake everything with respect to trade-related capacity building. It was a critical player, but it was one of many. The Strategy attempted to prioritise as to what would be addressed first. LDCs, African countries, non-residents, and modest and capacity-constrained missions were the focus of the Strategy. Her delegation also noted that there was a focus on effective cooperation recognizing that ad-hoc interventions did not have a lasting impact. That was something which had been raised by several delegations in previous sessions of the CTD and she noted that it had been taken into consideration. Her delegation's preference was to increase the WTO technical assistance budget rather than voluntary contributions to a centralized global trust fund. However, as that might not be immediately possible, her delegation recommended that consideration be given to a methodology to maximize the benefits of the many different trust funds. The Budget Committee could be tasked with looking at how to ensure that there was ongoing                                                                                    WT/COMTD/M/35                                                                                           Page 21 access to the financing required to deliver on the plan. In general, her delegation endorsed the Strategy.","WTCOMTDM35.pdf","Canada, Zambia, WTO, WTO, LDCs, CTD, WTO, Budget, Committee"
"3515",3515,"85","85.      He went on to say that the regional dimension of the WTO technical assistance Strategy should be a priority. The support that the WTO could provide, particularly to the regional secretariats of integration schemes of developing countries, needed to be reviewed and expanded. Ideas such as ownership and complementarity might remain empty words if links with regional institutions were not seriously taken into account. For many developing countries, the formulation of trade policies at the regional level was as important as the participation in the MTS. Regarding the autonomous efforts of capacity building by governments, he said that given the diversity of issues and interests that had to be involved and mobilised at the national level for appropriate national development-oriented trade policy formulation for participation in the global system, the capacity building delivered should not crowd out, but endorse and encourage other capacity-building initiatives undertaken by governments, private sector and civil society. While the WTO Secretariat had a key role to play in the delivery of technical assistance and capacity building, it had to work together with other inter-governmental institutions with a tradition in trade and development. Above all, the WTO Secretariat had to play its role in consultation and association with all stakeholders at the national level, and with appropriate bodies at the regional level. To that end, the role of the WTO Secretariat could be to adopt methods and instruments, which enabled it to work in association with other bodies to deliver technical assistance, especially, at the national level. Finally, with respect to strategic targets and developmental goals, he said that the delivery of technical co-operation had to be guided by strategic targets, defined in relation to the identified development interests, goals and priorities, especially of LDCs, to be met by trade instruments and policies. His delegation would make a submission to the Secretariat which he hoped would be helpful, especially as it came from one of the main beneficiaries of WTO technical assistance.","WTCOMTDM35.pdf","WTO, WTO, WTO, Secretariat, WTO, Secretariat, WTO, Secretariat, Secretariat, WTO"
"3514",3514,"84","84.     He went on to speak about the setting of trade policy as an element of a national development strategy and plan. In terms of the content, the Strategy Document made constant reference to the need to mainstream trade within national development. The meaning of that concept was ambiguous, and the usage tended to suggest that national development had to be formulated in the light of the multilateral trade regime. While there was a virtuous cycle between trade and development, it was clear that, in the current context of most developing countries, the role of trade in economic development and poverty reduction was related to its contribution to the development of national productive capacity. To play that role, trade policy had to reflect and contribute to the realisation of national plans for development and poverty reduction. Technical co-operation had to reflect that relationship. As regarded the process, it meant that WTO technical assistance ""as a mechanism for mainstreaming trade"" needed to go beyond co-ordination among government departments. Such co- ordination had to be part of a dialogue among government, and national stakeholders, including the private sector and governments. The Strategy also had to state clearly that it was the beneficiary countries that should set the objectives and determine the mainstreaming of trade into developmental policies. Developing countries should not have to feel that the Strategy was imposed on them from outside. Therefore, the issue of ownership was primordial, and had to be recognised and stated clearly in the Strategy document. That dialogue also had to extend to co-ordination among intergovernmental agencies; in particular those key ones involved in the IF. The complementarity between the WTO and other international organisations, based on their respective comparative advantage, had to be made visible and effective not only in the execution of technical co-operation activities, but also in their design. Usually, the participation of other organisations was introduced late, when the activities or the programs had already been conceived and sometimes launched. For instance, the draft rightly mentioned the importance of achieving a ""link between appropriate trade policies and development needs"". The most natural complementarity was the one between the WTO, UNCTAD and ITC, that was already implemented in some projects in the field, but could be further enhanced and improved. He noted that there was no reference to the technical co-operation role of ITC, which was a subsidiary of the WTO. Although the competence of ITC was not directly related to policy issues, ITC had an important role to play in terms of supply capacity, hence, the need for the Strategy document to mention co-operation with that organisation. In the new drive to develop capacity building, a necessary component was collaboration with other agencies like UNCTAD and ITC to address the various interrelated dimensions of technical assistance. In that regard, the Joint Integrated Technical WT/COMTD/M/35 Page 20 Assistance Programme for Selected African and Least-Developed Countries (JITAP) was missing in the Strategy document. JITAP was an innovative example in that respect and a model that could be used. He asked how JITAP was envisaged to contribute to the Strategy and what its place in the Strategy was. Complementarity should also extend to the linkages between UNCTAD and the Convention on Biological Diversity (BCD) in the context of TRIPS as they had comparative advantages in the area of bringing out more strongly the developmental needs. The over-riding goal of complementarity had to be to ensure appropriate policies that effectively worked in the development interests of developing countries and which did not restrict the range of their development options and policies. Moving on from complementarity to flexibility he said that it was important to achieve a good conciliation between the three approaches mentioned in the draft. If not well managed, they might become contradictory. In other words, the ownership and the demand- driven approach were key. There was a need to set priorities in a multi-year plan. The evolving trade agenda also required flexibility. According to his delegation, flexibility was to take into account changes in the subjects covered by technical assistance.","WTCOMTDM35.pdf","WTO, WTO, WTO, UNCTAD, ITC, ITC, WTO, ITC, ITC, UNCTAD, ITC, Joint, Integrated, Technical, WT/COMTD/M, Assistance, Programme, UNCTAD"
"3513",3513,"83","83.      He continued by referring to what his delegation saw as strategic aims and objectives. Informed by the developmental visions stated in the Marrakech Declaration, as well as by the experiences of the developing and LDCs, an appropriate strategy of technical assistance should aim to enable those countries to make the MTS respond to their needs. While assisting the countries to activate their rights and live up to their commitments under the existing rules, it also had to enable them identify the elements of the existing agreements which acted as obstacles in meeting their specific economic developmental needs (including, but not limited to, problems of market access, the destruction of domestic production and national productive capacity, food security, etc) and assist them in formulating proposals, and actions for dealing with these difficulties. Equally importantly, it had to be recognised that for the MTS to be sensitive to the specific and often peculiar development problems of developing countries, it was necessary that the developing countries themselves had the ability, above all the political autonomy and space, to identify their developmental needs and strategy, nationally and regionally, in response to those needs. That could be expressed appropriately in the rules and agreements of the MTS. Technical assistance had to be designed to facilitate, rather than crowd out those national processes of formulating trade policy on the basis of national development needs. The objectives of technical assistance should therefore include: (a)     assisting beneficiary countries to understand WTO rules and disciplines, strengthen their         capacity to implement multilateral trade agreements so as to exercise their rights under the         agreements, identify elements of existing agreements and proposals for further agreements         which act as obstacles in meeting their economic developmental needs so as to enable them to         formulate proposals and undertake actions to address them; and exploit the benefits and         opportunities;                                                                                     WT/COMTD/M/35                                                                                            Page 19 (b)     increasing the participation and negotiating capacity in regional trade agreements in a way         that is consistent with their development priorities and options; (c)     enhancing national capacity in the private sector, civil society and research and training         institutions and other national stakeholders to enable them to participate in the formulation         and implementation of trade policies; (d)     ensuring that the WTO worked jointly with other inter-governmental institutions, and         international and regional, as well as national stakeholders in order to ensure that technical         assistance is coherent with national developmental priorities. Trade policy coherence was, in         that regard, not simply coherence among inter-governmental institutions, but based on         identified development options and priorities within a national development strategy. Those         objectives were both additional to, and sharpened the focus of, the objectives listed in the         Strategy Document; (e)     developing countries had to have access to the WTO and be able to participate adequately in         the formulation of trade rules that imposed benefits and obligations on all Members. A         number of LDCs were non-resident members of the WTO, and many of those who were         present, were inadequately represented. He asked how, for example, non-resident members         were represented in the Strategy document in terms of inputs to it and how they could claim         ownership of it.","WTCOMTDM35.pdf","MTS, MTS, MTS, WTO, WTO, WTO, Members, LDCs, WTO"
"3512",3512,"82","82.      With respect to the inadequacies of the Strategy Document he said that while the New Strategy had a lot to be commended for, it suffered from a one-sided focus on the promotion of trade liberalisation and reform as the strategic aim of technical co-operation. For instance, paragraph 1 of WT/COMTD/M/35 Page 18 the Strategy Document stated that ""the core mandate of the WTO was trade liberalisation"". It continued: ""trade liberalisation and reform yield essential development dividends."" On that basis, the purpose of technical assistance was defined as providing ""enabling assistance for Members to undertake trade liberalisation"". Secretariat saw its function as support to ""Members/Observers to assist them understand WTO rules and disciplines, the obligations of Membership, and in building institutional capacity for trade policy"". Not only did that not pay sufficient attention to the vision in the Marrakech Agreement whereby the liberalisation of trade was placed in the context of, and served as one instrument of sustainable development, requiring positive efforts for developing countries to meet their particular economic developmental needs. The one-sided focus on trade liberalisation as the core mandate of the WTO within which the technical co-operation Strategy was premised was limited in a number of ways. Firstly, that the primary orientation of the Strategy Document was towards simply assisting developing countries to better understand and act within the existing agreements, with their rights and obligations. Secondly, where there was effort to place it in a wider context, the context was that of trade liberalisation and reform. Thirdly, those two concerns would seem to shape the interpretation that the Strategy Document placed on all the practical elements of technical co-operation, including such items as policy coherence, and co-operation with other institutions and stake holders and mainstreaming trade policy in national development policy. For instance footnote 5 on page 3 described a MoU between the WTO Secretariat and WIPO for assistance to LDCs on TRIPS. However, it appeared from the note that the main purpose of the memorandum was to assist ""LDC to implement their obligations under the TRIPS Agreement, which fall due in 2006"". LDCs and other developing country members had indicated that part of the problem of implementing TRIPS had to do both with the imbalances in that agreement, as well with the implications for their developmental priorities, and had been seeking a review of that Agreement. That strategic orientation of the Strategy Document was inadequate, and would not assist developing countries to effectively address, in a comprehensive manner, the obstacles they faced with full and meaningful participation in the MTS. For that, technical co-operation needed to have a more holistic orientation.","WTCOMTDM35.pdf","New, Strategy, WTO, Members, Secretariat, WTO, WTO, WTO, Secretariat, WIPO, LDCs"
"3511",3511,"81","81.      He went on to say that, over the past six year's life span of the WTO, developing countries and LDCs had experienced increasing marginalization. While that was related to structural economic difficulties in those countries themselves, it was recognised that a significant factor had to do with difficulties in relation to Uruguay Round Agreements. Fundamentally, these were problems related to the imbalances in the Agreements; the undermining of their rights by the other members of the WTO who had failed to live up to their commitments; the negative implications and impacts of some agreements on their economies; and the inadequate capacity to participate in shaping the processes, agenda and rules of the WTO. It was the inability to respond to those difficulties that defined the capacity needs of developing country members of the WTO, and should provide the framework for the technical co-operation Strategy designed to enable those countries participate fully and meaningfully in the MTS.","WTCOMTDM35.pdf","WTO, LDCs, Uruguay, WTO, WTO, WTO"
"3510",3510,"80","80.      The representative of Zambia said that the new Strategy aimed at charting a new path for WTO technical assistance which would emphasize capacity building. That was a welcome change as WTO technical assistance had been mostly about conforming to the rules. While the objective was good, the proposed means still conveyed the conventional WTO approach. His delegation's comments were meant to assist the Secretariat improve the thrust of the Strategy. They were meant to be constructive and although they might be rough, they were not meant as unproductive criticism. His comments were preliminary as he intended to submit a refined paper to the Secretariat. As stated in the Preamble to the Marrakech Declaration, the over-riding goal of the Multilateral Trading System (MTS) was to promote, through trade, the sustainable development of all countries, for them to participate in, and benefit from, the global creation of wealth and its equitable distribution. Furthermore in recognition of the fact that not all the world's nations were in a position immediately to participate equally in global trading system, the preamble called for the design of positive efforts to ensure that developing countries, particularly the least-developed, secure a share in the growth of international trade commensurate with the needs of their economic development. The need for positive efforts for developing countries to address their particular needs as a necessary element in their effective participation was given expression in the principles of special and differential treatment in the Uruguay Round Agreements.","WTCOMTDM35.pdf","Zambia, WTO, WTO, WTO, Secretariat, Secretariat, Uruguay"
"3509",3509,"8","8.     The representative of Egypt said that there had been some developments and his delegation was hopeful that the four requests could be agreed to, on an ad-hoc basis, for the next meeting of the CTD.","WTCOMTDM35.pdf","Egypt, CTD"
"3508",3508,"79","79.      He continued by saying that his delegation had been actively involved in the work to revamp the IF, and continued to be closely involved in its implementation. His only comment was that it was important to bear in mind that mainstreaming could not be achieved through the PRSP process alone. That was important to Members who were not PRSP countries and therefore efforts should be made to ensure that the framework was supportive of other initiatives being pursued by LDCs. His delegation was of the view that Integrated National Plans for WTO implementation were important and warranted full attention. The current discussions in the General Council on Implementation-related issues bore testimony to that point. Furthermore, while he did agree that there was a need to improve coherence between national institutions, he also believed that it was equally critical for the WTO Secretariat to improve its approach to delivery of technical assistance. By that he referred specifically to the quality of the missions undertaken by the WTO Secretariat. The experience of his Government had been that the Secretariat concentrated more on reading out the legal texts than on actually outlining the practicalities of the WTO Agreements. The main problem for his country was not to understand the legal text but to acquire the ability to relate WTO agreements to real life situations on the ground. With respect to bilateral donors, he supported the view expressed in the Strategy document that effective co-ordination was the key. To that end his delegation was actively involved in the work of the IF Steering Committee. It was important to underscore the importance his Government attached to the relationship it had with its bilateral partners. Regarding coordination, his delegation welcomed the creation of the Techncial Assistance Management Committee which had                                                                                      WT/COMTD/M/35                                                                                             Page 17 been set up in the WTO Secretariat. As far as auditing, monitoring and evaluation was concerned he considered it to be among the most critical elements of the Strategy and urged the Director-General to institutionalise its operation as early as possible. However, it was equally important that the channels for feedback from recipient countries were maintained and taken into account when conducting audits on the effectiveness of WTO technical assistance. Regarding funding, his delegation was of the view that it was critical to the successful implementation of the Strategy. It was a well-known fact that the ineffectiveness of past strategies was partly a result of the inadequate availability of predictable funding. As delegations moved towards the Fourth Ministerial Conference, they would be judging the commitment of their trading partners on the reaction to the proposal tabled requesting an increase in the regular budget of the WTO for Technical assistance. In conclusion, he pointed out that while his delegation welcomed the recent administrative restructuring of the WTO Secretariat, he hoped that the attention that had been directed at LDCs would not be eroded and that LDCs would continue to be a priority in the technical assistance activities of the WTO Secretariat. He had a question with respect to Section V of the Coordinated WTO Plan for Technical Assistance Activities, on the IF. He asked how the countries listed there had been selected and whether the selection had been made on the basis of the time frame prepared by the IF Steering Committee. The reason why he was posing that question was that his delegation had submitted a request for a national seminar a long time ago. If the Plan was the one for the year 2002, it meant that his request would only be met in 2003. If that was not the case, he sought guidance as to how it could be undertaken.","WTCOMTDM35.pdf","Members, WTO, General, Council, WTO, Secretariat, WTO, Secretariat, Secretariat, WTO, WTO, IF, Steering, Committee, Techncial, Assistance, Management, Committee, WTO, Secretariat, Director-General, WTO, WTO, WTO, Secretariat, WTO, Secretariat, Committee"
"3507",3507,"78","78.      The representative of Lesotho said that, his delegation fully shared the view expressed by the Deputy Director-General in his introductory remarks that technical assistance had emerged within the current series of consultations in preparation for the Fourth Ministerial Conference as the most central issue in all discussions. His delegation too, considered technical assistance and capacity building central to current and future work in this organization. He said he wished to make some specific comments on the Strategy, in particular its core elements. On technical assistance as a mechanism for mainstreaming, he supported the view that technical assistance could only be made effective if implemented in concert with other elements of a country's development strategy. However for the mainstreaming strategy to be effective it was imperative that the overall strategy which, in that case was the World Bank/IMF Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP) process made adequate provision for the role to be played by trade policy. From his country's experience the present guidelines on preparations of PRSPs were not clear, and as a consequence, the resulting PRSPs were weak on trade policy issues. He was aware that that issue would need to be raised again during the meeting of the Sub-Committee on Least-Developed Countries. His delegation agreed with the call for efforts to be intensified to address the issue of coherence between government ministries. Perhaps, one practical way the WTO could assist would be for the Trade Policy Review Division to undertake an assessment of the degree of coherence between ministries in developing countries, and in LDCs specifically, as part of the overall preparation for a review.","WTCOMTDM35.pdf","Lesotho, Director-General, WTO, Trade, Policy, Review, Division"

The Chairman asked Members to agree to the suggestion made by the Deputy Director- General that the views expressed and guidance offered on the new Strategy should be reflected in the Minutes of the meeting and that the Secretariat should be guided by those comments in the implementation of the Strategy.","WTCOMTDM35.pdf","Chairman, Members, Director, Secretariat"
"3505",3505,"76","76.     Finally, he outlined what he had foreseen as a procedure for the implementation of the New Strategy. In light of the extensive informal consultations held on the Strategy and the comprehensive WT/COMTD/M/35 Page 16 use of inputs from the Membership, he suggested that Members commented and offered guidance on the New Strategy. He further suggested that the Chairman, after interventions by delegations, would propose the CTD to take note of the new Strategy, on the explicit understanding that the Secretariat, in implementing the new Strategy, would be guided by the comments made and guidance offered at the meeting, which should also be in the formal records. Paragraph 20 of the Strategy stated that subsequent revisions of the Strategy would be undertaken at the periodic annual reviews. In proceeding in that way, the CTD would support the efforts underway at the informal sessions of the General Council with regard to the paragraph on technical assistance in the draft Ministerial Declaration.","WTCOMTDM35.pdf","Members, Chairman, CTD, Secretariat, CTD, General, Council"
"3504",3504,"75","75.      The newly formatted plan covered the period August to December 2001. That was the period of reorganization of the WTO Technical Cooperation. In the period under review, some 30 activities originally planned for the year 2001 had been postponed to 2002 for a variety of reasons. In some instances, for security considerations, in others, at the request of beneficiary countries. Although that plan contained entries for the year 2002, it was not the Plan for the next year. The entries for 2002 referred to those activities that had been deferred because of overriding circumstances and activities that had been linked to follow-up from 2001. These activities would also appear in the Plan for 2002, to be finalized in the second week of December 2001.","WTCOMTDM35.pdf","WTO, Technical, Cooperation"
"3503",3503,"74","74.     Fourth, there was a new structure for the Coordinated WTO Secretariat Annual Technical Assistance Plan, as contained in WT/COMTD/W/90/Add.1. The Plan was structured as follows:         Section I: contained Regional Seminars, Workshops and Multilateral Conferences;         Section II: referred to Short Trade Policy Courses as Technical Assistance Outside         Geneva;         Section III: contained information on National Technical Assistance Programmes;         Section IV: dealt with Information Technology and WTO Reference Centres;         Section V: concerned the Integrated Framework (IF); and         Section VI: contained Technical Assistance Tools Development.","WTCOMTDM35.pdf","WTO, Secretariat, Geneva, Information, Technology, WTO"
"3502",3502,"73","73.     Third, the structure of the New Strategy document was simple and divided into four Sections and eight Annexes.         Section I: set out the objectives;         Section II: referred to several of the various approaches that had been suggested by         Members;         Section III: identified ten elements that should be at the core of any optimal strategy         for WTO technical cooperation. That section was the centrepiece of the New         Strategy;         Section IV: described the new structure and the re-organization of the Technical         Cooperation Division. That section referred to the format of the new plan for the         delivery of technical assistance, which would operate on a 12-month basis. The         re-configured format was contained in document WT/COMTD/W/90/Add.1; and,         Annexes V-VIII: defined specific WTO technical assistance policy/strategy for         beneficiary regions and for the area of Information Technology/WTO Reference         Centres. The value of that section was that it related the broad strategy to region-         specific needs and priorities.","WTCOMTDM35.pdf","Members, WTO, WTO"
"3501",3501,"72","72.      Second, on sources of inputs for drafting the New Strategy he said that in drafting the New Strategy, the Secretariat had relied on several sources. First, it had drawn on the many comments made by Members in the CTD. Second, it had reviewed comments in the Sub-Committee on Least- Developed Countries. Third, valuable comments had been taken from the contributions by Members in the process of reviewing the IF. Fourth, the records of the General Council had proved useful with regard to comments made by Members, including in the context of implementation. Fifth, the Secretariat had taken into account the comments made in the on-going preparatory exercise for the Ministerial, both in the two rounds of consultations under bullet 6 of the Chairman's Checklist of 20 April 2001, and in the comments by delegations at the 30-31 July 2001 Reality Check. Finally, he knew that the Director of the Technical Cooperation Division had consulted extensively with individual delegations. The Secretariat had reviewed the records of statements and contributions on                                                                                     WT/COMTD/M/35                                                                                            Page 15 technical cooperation extensively. It had listened carefully, and he believed that the Secretariat had learned. The entire Secretariat had been given the opportunity to comment and comments received had been accommodated in the text.","WTCOMTDM35.pdf","Secretariat, Members, CTD, Members, General, Council, Members, Secretariat, Chairman, Director, Technical, Cooperation, Division, Secretariat, Secretariat, Secretariat"
"3500",3500,"71","71.      First, on the importance of technical assistance and capacity building, he said that one of the core issues that had stood out in the preparatory exercise for the Fourth Ministerial Conference was the vital importance of technical cooperation and capacity building. That had been emphasised by all Members, particularly developing countries, LDCs, small and vulnerable economies, as well as economies in transition. It had been a central element in many regional preparatory meetings for the Fourth Ministerial Conference organized by developing countries and LDCs. It had been linked to implementation of WTO rights and obligations, developing countries' ability to exercise their rights, and ability to draw on the benefits of the open, rules-based multilateral trading system. Evidence for that abounded in the various declarations that had been circulated as WTO Working documents. Technical cooperation and capacity building had to be taken seriously.","WTCOMTDM35.pdf","Members, Fourth, Ministerial, Conference, WTO, WTO"
"3499",3499,"70","70.     The Deputy Director-General, Mr. Ravier, said that, at the May meeting of the CTD, he had hoped to be able to present a new technical cooperation strategy and a revised plan of action in October. He was happy that the deadlines had been met. He said that he would introduce the new documents and give the state of preparations for the current year and the outlook for 2002. In introducing the New WTO Strategy for WTO Techncial Cooperation he would focus on five specific issues:         (a)     The importance of technical assistance and capacity-building;         (b)     Sources of inputs into the Strategy, (document WT/COMTD/W/90);         (c)     The structure of the Strategy document;         (d)     Coordinated WTO Secretariat Annual Technical Assistance Plan for 2001-2002,                 (WT/COMTD/W/90/Add.1); and,         (e)     Procedures for the consideration of the Strategy.","WTCOMTDM35.pdf","Director-General, Ravier, CTD, WTO, WTO, Techncial, Cooperation, WTO, Secretariat"

The Chairman recall that the Committee had four outstanding requests for observer status from the League of Arab States, from OPEC, from the Gulf Organization for Industrial Consulting and from the Organization Internationale de la Francophonie. He had carried out some informal consultations on those requests, and he regretted to inform the Committee that it appeared that there was not yet consensus on those requests. The positions of delegations were well known and on the record. Unless there had been any recent change of position, he proposed that the Committee revert to those requests at its next formal meeting of the CTD.","WTCOMTDM35.pdf","Chairman, Committee, League, of, Arab, States, OPEC, Gulf, Organization, for, Industrial, Consulting, Organization, Internationale, de, la, Francophonie, Committee, Committee, CTD"

"3495",3495,"67","67.      The representative of the Secretariat said that when he had last participated in a meeting of the Preparatory Committee, the CTD had just managed to produce a consensus document. As he had reported back to the CTD, he had brought that document with him to the meeting of the Preparatory Committee. It had been well received but as it had just been put before the Preparatory Committee there had not been any substantial discussion of it at that meeting. Since then, the Zedillo report and the Facilitator's report had been issued which touched on a large number of topics on which the WTO Membership might have views. WTO Members might deal with the issue directly in New York depending on how the interaction between their Geneva-based and New York-based missions worked. WTO Members could ensure that their representatives in New York expressed the same views on the Facilitator's report, which would be the main topic at the upcoming meeting of the Preparatory Committee, as WTO Members expressed in Geneva, particularly on the two areas of the report dealing with international trade and the section on systemic issues in so far as it touched the WTO. The WTO Secretariat would be represented by Deputy Director-General, Mr. Ouedraogo, at the meeting of the Preparatory Committee and he would point out that the Facilitator's Report had not been fully reviewed in the WTO and that WTO Members would have different views on different topics. The text was the proposal of the Facilitator. It would not be easy for the WTO Membership to express firm views on the FFD documents at this stage, apart from saying that the Facilitator's report was interesting but still controversial. The WTO Membership might be in a better position, after the Fourth Ministerial Conference, to make a full input into the next stage of the preparatory process, which would be in January 2002. The CTD could, if noted, hold an intensive meeting on the FFD process after the Ministerial Conference.","WTCOMTDM35.pdf","Secretariat, Preparatory, Committee, CTD, CTD, Preparatory, Committee, Preparatory, Committee, Zedillo, WTO, WTO, Members, New, York, WTO, Members, New, York, Preparatory, Committee, WTO, Members, Geneva, WTO, WTO, Secretariat, Director-General, Ouedraogo, Preparatory, Committee, WTO, WTO, Members, WTO, WTO, CTD"
"3494",3494,"66","66.     The representative of the European Communities said that his delegation had followed the process closely and that there had been a large number of discussions in the CTD to produce the Members' input. His delegation was unsure about how much of the valuable and difficult work WTO Members had carried out that had been taken into account in the various papers from the Preparatory Committee. However, the recent report by the Facilitator and the Zedillo Panel seemed to have taken some of it into account. He asked how the members of the WTO Secretariat who would continue to participate in the process would address those issues. He also asked whether they would come back to the paper, which had been partly reflected, but on export subsidies for example there were stronger language in the report from the FFD process that WTO Members would not sign up to. The CTD was the focal point within the WTO, but he was not clear as to what the CTD could do more than to take note of reports. He asked if CTD Members were of the view that the CTD should do more, such as for example go through the papers emerging from the FFD process in more detail and what they thought a useful role for the WTO could be. To only produce one paper as an input and then withdraw would not fulfill the role the WTO should play.","WTCOMTDM35.pdf","European, Communities, CTD, Members, WTO, Members, Preparatory, Committee, Zedillo, Panel, WTO, Secretariat, WTO, Members, CTD, WTO, CTD, CTD, Members, CTD, WTO, WTO"
"3493",3493,"65","65.     The representative of the Secretariat then drew the Committee's attention to the report of a High-level Panel, appointed by the UN Secretary-General and headed by former President Zedillo of Mexico. The report had been presented to the General Assembly in June 2001. English-language copies of the Executive Summary of the Panel's report were made available in the room and the full 70 page report could be downloaded from the FFD website. The WTO was involved at Secretariat and Membership levels in the FFD process. At the same time, WTO Members' own Ministerial process was currently taking priority in the work of WTO Members. WTO Members could therefore probably not make any substantial input at the moment as the preparations for the Forth WTO Ministerial Conference was ongoing. The outcome of the Ministerial Meeting would undoubtedly be an input into the UN process. He hoped that the WTO would be able to make a positive contribution to the Monterrey Conference.","WTCOMTDM35.pdf","Secretariat, Committee, UN, Zedillo, Mexico, General, Assembly, WTO, Secretariat, WTO, Members, WTO, Members, WTO, Members, WTO, UN, WTO"
"3492",3492,"64","64.     The afore-mentioned points were proposals prepared by the Facilitator for consideration in the following week's Prep Com meeting, at which the WTO would be present as a participant observer, along with participants, who were essentially the same as those of the WTO membership. It was suggested that delegations could use the ""Draft Outcome"" in giving advice and instructions to the participant members in the upcoming Prep Com meeting.

"3491",3491,"63","63.      The representative of the Secretariat went on to explain that page 1 of the ""Draft Outcome"" set out seven broad principles to which it recommended that the nations commit themselves: equity, solidarity, co-responsibility, foresight, participation, ownership and partnership. With respect to trade-related issues, page 4 of the Draft Outcome discusses international trade as an engine for growth and development. The Draft Outcome, on trade-related issues makes the following points:         •       Trade liberalization would substantially contribute to achieve development of world                 wide; trade barriers and subsidies in developed countries – which currently impose                 costs on developing countries that significantly exceed aid flows – must be                 eliminated. The multilateral trading system must decisively benefit all developing                 countries and countries in transition.         •       Lifting of trade barriers should not be followed by the introduction of new ones;         •       Labour and environmental concerns should be pursued as separate goals through the                 appropriate institutions and fora;         •       World trade should support development goals including by securing full                 implementation of commitments made by developed countries in the Uruguay Round;         •       Enhancing the role of regional and subregional agreements and free trade areas, could                 be a role in providing building blocks for the construction of a better global trading                 system;         •       All industrial countries that have not already done so, should take steps to liberalize                 all imports except arms from LDCs;         •       Multilateral, financial and development institutions should devise ways to stabilize                 the export revenue of developing countries that still depend heavily on commodity                 exports; and         •       Multilateral and bilateral financial and development institutions should deepen their                 support for efforts by developing countries to remove supply-side constraints and                 improve their trade infrastructure.","WTCOMTDM35.pdf","Secretariat, Uruguay, Round"
"3490",3490,"62","62.     The context of the Conference's work was the role of financing for development in achieving the aims set out in the UN's Millennium Declaration as the International Development Goals for 2015. The Conference would have three segments: a High-Level Officials' meeting, a Ministerial segment where governments would be invited to send fully integrated delegations with representatives from all relevant national Ministries, and a Summit segment. The Conference would take up six main themes: domestic resource mobilization in developing countries; the role of private capital flows; the role of trade; the role of international development cooperation, including the ODA; and a series of ""systemic issues"" relating to the framework of international cooperation on economic, financial and developmental questions.

That Conference would be held in Monterrey, Mexico. A Preparatory Committee (Prep Com), currently co-chaired by the Canadian and Thai Ambassadors in New York, had been working on preparing the Conference, which was originally to have been held in 2001, but was postponed to 2002. The Committee was reminded and asked to note, that at its last meeting it had been informed of the WTO's attendance at the last Prep Com. The Prep Com had met three times so far. Its next meeting was in the week of 15 October, with the main discussion focussing on a ""Draft Outcome"" document which was being prepared by a Facilitator - Dr. Mauricio Escanero of Mexico - who had been appointed by the Prep Com. Copies of the Draft Outcome were available in the meeting room, and the WTO Secretariat was going to the Prep Com meeting the following week to listen to the discussion, to be able to report on the outcome of the discussions of the ""Draft Outcome"".

To a large extent, a seminar was a possibility for Members to deepen their knowledge and get inspiration and ideas. However, the long-term aim was that the ideas would move the work of the Committee, and the overall WTO Work Programme, forward. The seminar had fulfilled this purpose, as it had fed both into the dedicated discussion on cross-cutting issues which had been held under the auspices of the General Council on the following day, and into the later informal consultation on a programme of work on electronic commerce in the CTD.","WTCOMTDM35.pdf","Chairman, Committee, Members, Committee, WTO, Work, Programme, General, Council, CTD"
"3478",3478,"51","51.    Some of the main lines of thought that had emerged from the seminar were that:         •          Governments have an important role to play in creating an enabling environment for                    e-commerce. In this way, focus can be placed on digital ""dividends"" rather than                    digital ""divides"";         •          A strategic government plan on e-commerce is advisable and should be inclusive;         •          Economic, technical and legal measures are all necessary elements in creating an                    enabling environment;         •          The development of physical, legal and human infrastructure, as well as fostering                    confidence are important aspects of that environment;         •          Experiences of developing and developed country governments are similar and                    overlap in many respects; both developing and developed countries may learn from                    each other's experience. However, the resource availabilities and constraints are very                    different;         •          Relations among parties change through e-commerce; therefore, Governments,                    private sector and civil society have to work together to build a coherent framework                    for e-commerce.","WTCOMTDM35.pdf",""

The document was a recognition by the WAEMU of the implementation of Article VII of the GATT. Within the aim of developing sub-regional trade, it was necessary to assure customs authorities and economic operators of the application of equitable and uniform rules regulating to the customs value of goods which would also be neutral and compatible with the multilateral trading system.

"3471",3471,"45","45.     The representative of the Secretariat said that it was difficult to analyze, in practice, whether a Member was using one type of preferential provision or another in access to different markets, particularly the EC market. As a convention in the Secretariat study, when an ACP country could use separate ACP benefits into the EC market, it was assumed that it had done so and had consequently been counted as ACP rather than GSP preference utilisation. However, it was almost impossible to know whether, in practice, a Member such as Kenya had used ACP preferential treatment for some products and GSP treatment for others.","WTCOMTDM35.pdf","Secretariat, Member, EC, Secretariat, EC, GSP, Member, Kenya, ACP, GSP"

"3467",3467,"41","41.      The representative of the Secretariat said that one of the lessons that had been learned quite quickly from the research for the study was that, despite the fact that Members had generally made regular notifications of the changes in their GSP schemes, as noted in Annex I, there was no easy way of using the notifications. The fact that the Secretariat had changed the numbering of notifications since the introduction of the WTO incidentally made them easier to track; the GATT references to GSP schemes made in the L-series of documents were far from easy to track. Few notifications, were in electronic form. Few, if any, were formulated in a way that easily showed how changes related to the full structure of the schemes or to their impact. It was therefore difficult to analyse the impact of GSP schemes using the notifications alone. Fortunately, UNCTAD had done some useful work in producing handbooks on individual schemes and the Secretariat had leaned heavily on that work in describing the scheme. One of the most important questions for the utility of the notification process for all Members of the WTO might be to obtain comprehensive notifications on GSP schemes available through electronic means and readily accessible to all Members. He suggested that, in the future, this might be done through links with relevant national websites. If it was agreed, at a later meeting of the CTD, to continue work on the issue, it would also be useful to consider joint research with the UNCTAD Secretariat to look at how data on GSP could be supplied in a compatible way by various Members and to explore what other aspects of GSP schemes could possibly be examined in                                                                                       WT/COMTD/M/35                                                                                               Page 9 the future.

"3466",3466,"40","40.      He continued by saying that in compiling the statistical analysis the Secretariat had principally used the IDB data base, supplemented in one case by information from UNCTAD's TRAINS data base. In the analysis, trade was categorized by tariff treatment rather than by source, with the aim of avoiding double counting and to make it as clear as possible how far preferential access was being granted and how far the different categories of preferential access were applicable. The rules that had been applied in doing that were spelled out on pages 14 and 16 of the study. Tables 2 to 5 on pages 17 to 24 showed, successively, the value of imports by forms of tariff treatment; the average rates of duty corresponding to the same forms of treatment; the number of tariff lines covered by the various forms of treatment; and the top 20 GSP beneficiaries in each of the Quad members. The data were all for 1999 which was the most recent year for which compatible figures were available. Tables AI and AII completed the statistical analysis presented in Part IV by breaking down the tariff treatment and trade by various preferential categories, including GSP by agricultural products and industrial products. In those areas, the definitions conventionally used in the Uruguay Round defining industrial and agricultural products had been used. Part V of the study raised some questions that the Secretariat believed to be relevant, or possibly worthy of further study. Those were outlined in bold in paragraphs 82, 84, 86, 87, 88, and 90. A suggestion for possible further work on the basis of a modelling approach was made in the final paragraph.","WTCOMTDM35.pdf","Secretariat, IDB, UNCTAD, GSP, GSP, Uruguay, Round, Secretariat"

The Director of the Development Division said that the study was a preliminary analysis of aspects of the GSP schemes of the Quad and did not yet cover other developed country markets. The study had been carried out at the request of the Committee but in response particularly to a request from the delegation of the United States, at the 32nd Session of the CTD, for further information on the WT/COMTD/M/35 Page 8 benefits of the GSP. He realised that Members would not have had time to study the document and therefore wished to hold it on the agenda for a future meeting of the CTD. The aim of the study was to provide an introduction to the functioning of the GSP, including the preferences provided by developed countries and the benefits drawn by developing countries. In practice, what the Secretariat had been able to do in the time available and the material to hand was a limited analysis of the GSP schemes of the Quad. The survey was divided into five parts. After an introductory section, Section II provided an overview of the history and rationale of the GSP system from the earliest days of the Prebisch and Singer academic work till now, relating it to the Enabling Clause provisions of the GATT and raising some points that had been brought up in the WTO context, for example in Trade Policy Reviews. Section III aimed to give a brief description of the main features of the GSP schemes of the Quad, including criteria under which countries might qualify for GSP treatment, rules of origin and some indication of utilisation rates. In preparing the study the Secretariat had used a wide range of material, including useful work done by UNCTAD on utilisation of GSP. Part IV of the study was an attempt to give a consistent statistical analysis of tariff treatment and trade of GSP beneficiaries and other export sources in the Quad countries, MFN or other preferential sources. It showed quite graphically the relative importance of GSP and other preferential sources in the US, Canadian, EC and Japanese markets.","WTCOMTDM35.pdf","Director, Development, Division, GSP, Committee, United, States, CTD, GSP, Members, CTD, GSP, Secretariat, GSP, GSP, Prebisch, GATT, WTO, GSP, Secretariat, UNCTAD, GSP, GSP, MFN, GSP, US, EC"

The representative of the European Communities said that his delegation was willing and committed to having a WTO conform procedure of achieving the goal stated in page 2, paragraph 3.

The representative of Ecuador said that, the second sentence of the third paragraph on page 2 of the notification by the European Communities stated that ""Duties on those products will be gradually reduced until duty-free access will be granted for bananas in January 2006 …"". His delegation thought that the European Communities already granted duty-free access for bananas in the quota. What was mentioned in the notification was duty-free access for the three quotas A,B and C as of 2006. That had neither been agreed to, nor authorized and there was no waiver for it. The waiver and the conditions were to begin to be negotiated in the coming 90 days.

The representative of the European Communities said that he wished to draw delegations' attention to the fact that the initiative had already been discussed in various stages under various bodies. The Secretariat paper on the Generalized System of Preferences (WT/COMTD/W/93) to be discussed under the following agenda item had a sentence on page 7, which stated that ""At the time of drafting this report (September 2001), the changes had yet to be notified to the WTO."" His delegation had then realized that it had not fulfilled the formal requirements and had therefore submitted a notification. He did not wish to see another discussion in the CTD, especially as it would be transferred to the Sub-Committee on Least-Developed Countries.

"3447",3447,"23","23.      The representative of the European Communities welcomed the document as a necessary basis for getting to grips with the issue of special and differential treatment, which was being dealt with not only in the CTD, but had gained prominence elsewhere, notably in the implementation debate. He said that Members were looking ahead, although there was no agreement as yet, to continue work on special and differential treatment, be it in the Committee on Trade and Development, a special procedure stemming from the report presented by the Chairman (WT/GC/52), the implementation debate, or a debate on rules, depending on the future work programme of the WTO which he believed would be ambitious. He said that the paper was particularly useful in putting the right questions, and his delegation was intrigued by pages 10 and 11 where a number of good questions had been raised. The discussion that had been held following the request by the Chairman of the General Council in a more pragmatic way already showed that many of the points had come back in the short discussion on the possible mandate of the CTD. He said that it was necessary that the discussion be forward looking, as well as backward looking on the existing provisions. It was understood that there was much discontent with the manner in which special and differential treatment provisions operated, and his delegation agreed that making them more effective and operational was a major objective of the organisation, and one to which his delegation fully subscribed. He said it was interesting to note that, as reflected in part D, part of the debate on special and differential treatment WT/COMTD/M/35 Page 6 was now connected to new negotiations in agriculture and services, and his delegation expected that focus on special and differential treatment to be reflected in any other area which Members might take up in the future. He said that that was not a call for a new round of negotiations, but rather a reminder that it was important to keep in mind the overall objectives. He pointed to the concept of flexibility of commitments, of action, and use of policy instruments, and, referred to GATS Article XVI which showed that flexibility in the agreement was built-in on a case-by-case basis. That was a prime example which showed how the future construction of rules, and future negotiations in agriculture, services and beyond, could look at the architecture of agreements to see how it would be possible to achieve the objectives of the organisation without having excessive recourse to a rules-and-exemption type approach which had characterised the debate to date. WT/COMTD/W/77/Rev.1 was a useful working document. He welcomed the fact that it had the nucleus of a distinction between mandatory and non-mandatory provisions, which had been discussed at length elsewhere. With respect to the discussion on special and differential treatment held in the context of Implementation Tiret 96, his delegation looked forward to further discussions and hoped these would lead to a meaningful decision.","WTCOMTDM35.pdf","European, Communities, CTD, Members, Committee, on, Trade, and, Development, Chairman, WTO, Chairman, General, Council, CTD, Members"
"3446",3446,"22","22.      The representative of the United States said that the document was a useful reference for the Committee in its work on special and differential treatment. However, his delegation did not believe that the document reflected adequately the benefits derived by developing country Members already received in areas and agreements discussed by the paper. For example, the paper recorded numerous criticisms of the Generalised System of Preferences (GSP), but did not contain any discussion of its benefits or data on the use of GSP schemes by developing countries. He said the paper should be changed to better reflect the benefits and technical assistance developing countries were already receiving, and recommended that in redrafting the paper, the Secretariat make use of information on the participation of developing countries in international trade, that was currently under preparation.","WTCOMTDM35.pdf","United, States, Committee, Members, Secretariat"
"3445",3445,"21","21.     The Director of the Development Division introduced document WT/COMTD/W/77/Rev.1 and noted that it was a complete update of the earlier document WT/COMTD/W/77 produced in 2000. He drew the attention of Members to sections II:B and II:C of the paper in particular. Section II:B contained a breakdown of the provisions for special and differential treatment in WTO agreements according to the six different categories that had become common usage in WTO discussions. The section contained a short description of each category of special and differential treatment provisions, as well as a listing of each individual provision that fell into a particular category. Provisions listed in bold indicated those which, in the assessment of the Secretariat, were couched in mandatory language. An analysis was also provided of how the provisions relating to LDCs were broken down in relation to the five other categories. In section II:C, the paper raised a number of questions that might facilitate consideration by members on how provisions for special and differential treatment could be operationalised and enhanced. These questions drew on the information contained in part II:B and part III of the paper. Part III of the paper provided a substantial amount of information on each provision and each agreement, in particular where steps had been taken in Councils and Committees concerning the provisions for special and differential treatment. Information was provided on an agreement-by-agreement basis, including on negotiating proposals presented in the Special Sessions of the Committee on Agriculture and the Council for Trade in Services. He hoped that the document would be a good basis for the discussions that would take place on operationalising S&D provisions in the WTO.","WTCOMTDM35.pdf","Director, Development, Division, Members, WTO, WTO, Secretariat, Committee, on, Agriculture, Council, for, Trade, in, Services, WTO"
"3444",3444,"20","20.      The Chairman said that the CTD had had a number of discussions on special and differential treatment (S&D), both in the context of the work programme of the CTD and in the context of the General Council's work on implementation. The question of operationalisation of special and differential treatment had come up repeatedly, and was discussed in the Secretariat Note (WT/COMTD/W/77/Rev.1). He said that in the CTD's past discussions, he had detected a strong interest by Members in moving forward on the question of special and differential treatment in order to make it more effective. He wondered whether, without prejudice to what Members may decide in                                                                                      WT/COMTD/M/35                                                                                              Page 5 the General Council in relation to implementation and preparations for Fourth Ministerial Conference, Members were prepared to continue in that forward looking spirit and attempt to examine ways in which special and differential treatment could be made more effective and operational.

"3443",3443,"2","2.      The Director of the Development Division said that there were a number of revisions to the airgram reflecting new developments. First, Item D, on Participation of Developing Countries in World Trade, had been deleted. There were two reasons for that. The first was that the information the Secretariat had been compiling for that paper had been pre-empted by the Director-General's Report on Developments in the Multilateral Trading System, which would be issued before the Fourth Ministerial Conference. That document would contain substantial sections on both the participation of developing countries in international trade, and their participation in WTO activities. The Secretariat had therefore decided to hold off but continued to consider how value could be added to the Director-General's paper later in the year. The second reason was that the developments of the last few months and weeks had changed the economic prospects for developing countries. It was already difficult to ""call"" the changes in the economic scene emerging from the downturn in the US and world economy since late 1999, and that had recently been made even more difficult and more negative, at least in the short run. In those circumstances, it would be pointless to put out a paper now. The Secretariat therefore proposed to issue, if possible by the end of the year, a paper which would complement and if possible update the Director-General's report. The proposed study would bear the tentative title of ""Implications for Developing Countries of Changes in the Structure of World Trade"" and would be factual. It would focus on examining the ways in which the changing product and service composition of world trade impacts on the trading opportunities of developing countries.","WTCOMTDM35.pdf","Director, Development, Division, Secretariat, Director-General, WTO, Secretariat, Director-General, US, Secretariat, Director-General"

The growth of Internet and e-commerce presents growth opportunities to developing countries. A study shows a connection between increases in Web-hosts and trade and that the effect on the Internet on trade had been stronger in developing than in developed countries. Increasing Internet access can have positive effects on the exports of developing countries. To achieve that, a focus on institutional infrastructure and innovation is necessary. Institutional issues should be addressed at the local and global levels. It must be a government wide initiative and not only one ministry (the ministries of trade, economics, education, transport and telecommunications normally need to be involved). At the global level, the WTO and the ITA are useful. There is a need to build infrastructure; both physical and human infrastructure. There is also a need for innovation in joint public-private projects.","WTCOMTDM35.pdf","United, States, ICT, WTO, ITA"

It therefore concentrates on:          1.     investigating opportunities for, and obstacles to, e-commerce in the areas of the                 different government authorities;          2.     monitoring, mapping and reporting on the impact of e-commerce on Swedish                 companies;          3.     promoting the use of e-commerce in state-owned companies;          4.     ensuring predictable and technology neutral regulations;          5      promoting e-government 24 hours a day, seven days a week. This increases the                 accessibility of the Government services. (The tax administration is the most visited                 Government site.) Most central, regional and local government agencies have                 Websites and e-mail addresses for the public to use;          6.     ensuring IT security.

A Green Paper was produced which was open to inputs from the public. A Green Paper is normally turned into a White Paper, but that process had to be cut short because of the speed of developments in the area of e-commerce so the Government went straight to the Bill. The main objective of the Bill is universal access. It has been renamed the ""Electronic Communications and Transactions Bill"". Human resource development is another objective. At the top of the main objectives of the Electronic Transactions Bill is the question of development of SMEs and investor access.

This means that the Government of South Africa has certain rights, obligations and responsibilities. There is a dire need for building communications infrastructure overall.

Mexico's openness in the area during the last year has been an important factor determining the decision to adopt new technologies. More than 14,000 firms in Mexico today use electronic means of transaction, usually EDI (Electronic Data Interchange) and the Internet. The main effort in Mexico began in 1998 with the setting up of a group to develop the first law on e-commerce based on the UNCITRAL model law and studies of the laws of the US, Canada and certain countries of the European Communities. The law was finalized and adopted in 2000. Within the new government, a programme for e-commerce is driven by the Secretariat of Communication and Transport, because of the fundamental role played by infrastructure; it also includes technology and interconnection. Another aspect for the Mexican Government to deal with is administration, including training of personnel and monitoring of e-networks. A third is the legal aspect. Lawyers are currently analyzing different regulations to be promulgated in various fields. The forth aspect is content and programmes where the Secretariat of Economy is involved in close cooperation with Secretariat of Communication and Transport to provide value-added aspects such as health, services, education, and trade.

ICT research is important, as is finding new ways of teaching. It is necessary to work with the private sector to know what type of skills the industry is looking for. A more competitive telecommunications market is part of any solution, as is inspiring people to use more ICTs. Awareness campaigns and information centers are two initiatives to make people in general acquainted with ICT and learn about the possibilities of e-commerce.

The Canadian Government measures the impact of the information technology revolution on society. This will be more systematic with next national survey.

The rapid development and diffusion of e-commerce requires a broad collaborate approach by governments, private sector, civil society and international organizations. The role of the government is to meet the public interest in creating an environment for global e-commerce in which the basic rules are appropriate, clear and predictable. Existing unnecessary international legal and regulatory barriers should be eliminated and the emergence of new ones prevented. The priority for both governments and industry is to foster confidence in the instruments and networks of e-commerce. The leading role of the private sector is to simulate the growth of global e-commerce through investments and dynamic innovation in products and services. Civil society must be engaged in efforts to facilitate the growth of e-commerce and maximize its potential in social, civic and community development. International cooperation plays a key role in creating a seamless environment for e-commerce.","WTCOMTDM35.pdf",""
"3417",3417,"165","165.     The challenge is to strike the right balance between government regulation and laissez-faire. E-commerce can not be regulated in the old, classical sense, there has to be co-regulation, i.e. a mixed public/private approach. Barriers to trade can come from overregulation, effectively limiting choices and opportunities in markets as well as from a lack of regulation effectively resulting in commercial and/or national solutions also limiting choices and international harmonization. Current initiatives on which the Canadian Government is working include cryptography, where the Government liberalizes rules and encourages industry-led accreditation of private sector certification authorities. Consumer protection laws with voluntary business guidelines have been drafted by industry, Government and consumer organizations in cooperation. The current focus is on how to operationalize these. The Government felt the need for specific legislation regarding privacy, which it enacted in January 2001. This legislation sets the rules for the collection, use and disclosure of personal information, aiming at balancing the rights of the individual with the needs of commercial organizations. A Ministerial Committee on Taxation has been established with the Government committed to have a technology neutral taxation regime. One e-commerce related bill clarified 200 other pieces of legislation with respect to electronic transactions. Consumer protection is to a large extent based on a voluntary code.","WTCOMTDM35.pdf","Ministerial, Committee, on, Taxation"

Some of the main lines of thought emerging from the seminar were that:         •       Governments have an important role to play in creating an enabling environment for                 e-commerce. In this way, focus can be placed on digital dividends rather than digital                 divides.         •       The development of physical, legal and human infrastructure, as well as fostering                 confidence are important aspects of that environment.         •       Economic, technical and legal measures are all necessary.         •       Experiences of developing and developed country governments are similar and                 overlap in many respects, but the resource constraints are very different. Both                 developing and developed countries may learn from each other's experience.         •       A strategic government plan on e-commerce is advisable and should be inclusive.         •       Relations among parties change through e-commerce.         •       Governments, private sector and civil society have to work together to build a                 coherent framework for e-commerce.

A task force might ideally comprise a large number of government departments, as the promotion of modern ICT has to be a government-wide initiative and does not concern only one Ministry. For example, the ministries with responsibilities in the areas of trade, economics, education, transport and telecommunications normally need to be involved. However, a large number of other ministries, such as tourism, might have to be involved depending on the situation of each country.

If the digital divide is the gap between what is wanted and the actual level, then every country suffers from a human resources digital divide, although it is more acute in developing countries.

However, all countries seem to experience a lack of people with ICT-related education. Several problems relating to human capacity have therefore been identified, such as digital illiteracy, ICT skills gap (lack of technicians and professionals) and high access costs.

"3402",3402,"151","151.     Strategies for technology implementation that can facilitate e-commerce development are important. An appropriate legal and regulatory environment can help to attract investment in the infrastructure for modern information and communication technology (ICT). Questions for governments to ask are: How can our existing infrastructure be used and investment attracted? Which types of services will bring the additional benefit that other sectors develop? The legal and regulatory framework should encourage competition, better services and wider availability of ICTs. In some developing countries monopolies are blocking investment, even by local businesses. Governments also need to encourage the development of networks such as the Internet and facilitate for different types of service providers.

The consumer law in most countries focuses on giving the consumer the possibility to bring the seller to court, rather than on mediation. Alternatives to court proceedings for e-commerce are still open to discussion and debate. Basic alternatives to court proceedings are conciliation, mediation, and arbitration. A voluntary code of conduct could be drafted by the private sector, civil society and the government in cooperation. A first step in a voluntary code of conduct could be a policy on returned goods which could apply to e-commerce just as it applies to ""normal"" commerce.

In the meantime, a tool for countries wanting to implement legislation on e-commerce today could be the UNCITRAL model laws and guidelines (UNCITRAL Law on e-commerce 1996 and the UNCITRAL uniform rules on electronic signatures). At least provisions replicating the UNCITRAL model law might be necessary in each country. Another international source from which some countries have received inspiration is the European Communities' directives on digital signatures and e-commerce. Another approach could be for governments to adopt codes of conduct WT/COMTD/M/35 Page 34 regulations. OECD and ECE UN/CEFACT are sources of information on codes of conduct. Instead of having to wait for legislation, contractual solutions could be found. One example is the model EDI Agreement (interchange agreement) of the European Communities. One of the problems associated with contractual solutions is the privacy of contracts, i.e. contracts do not relate to third parties. Another is that some governments do not enforce contractual provisions.","WTCOMTDM35.pdf","UNCITRAL, UNCITRAL, UNCITRAL, UNCITRAL, OECD"

It is technically possible to have authentication, message integrity and no repudiation (i.e. the sender cannot later claim that he/she had not sent a particular message) for electronic signatures. However, legal frameworks are missing. There is also a lack of clarity as to on-line dispute resolution with respect to consumer claims, arbitration, mediation and insurance complaints for example. Questions arise as to which law applies and as to which court has jurisdiction. The solutions could be for a country to sign an international convention, adopt international instruments, use national legislation, or allow for contractual solutions and self-regulation.","WTCOMTDM35.pdf",""

The rapid development and diffusion of e-commerce requires a broad collaborative approach by governments, the private sector, civil society and international organizations. E-commerce cannot be regulated in the old, classical sense; it needs ""co-regulation"", i.e. a mixed public and private approach, integrating government regulation and legislation with business practices and civil society concerns. The priorities for both government and industry should be to foster confidence in the instruments and networks of e-commerce. The role of the government should be to meet the public interest in creating an environment for global e-commerce in which the ground rules are appropriate, clear and predictable. Unnecessary international legal and regulatory barriers should be eliminated and the emergence of new ones prevented. The role of the private sector is to stimulate growth of global e-commerce through investment and dynamic innovation in products and services. Civil society must play a role in efforts to facilitate the growth of e-commerce and maximize its potential in social, civic and community development. International cooperation is very important in creating a seamless environment for e-commerce.","WTCOMTDM35.pdf",""

One particular challenge is to strike a correct balance between government regulation and laissez-faire. Barriers to trade can come from over-regulation, effectively limiting choices and opportunities in markets, as well as from a lack of regulation resulting in lost opportunities because of insecurity and distrust.

It was stated that governments, together with the private sector and civil society, have an important role to play in creating an enabling environment for e-commerce. A legal framework is necessary to enhance the benefits from e-commerce; however, governments should not over-regulate and regulations adopted should be technology neutral. Areas mentioned in which governments need to take action include:         1.      building trust in the digital market place (privacy, cryptography, consumer                 protection);         2.      clarifying market rules (legal framework, taxation, trade rules, IP policies);         3        A previous seminar on the development implications of e-commerce was held on 19 February 1999 (WT/COMTD/18).

The options detailed in the study usually involved some element of cooperation on a regional basis, and the pooling of resources. The concrete implementation of those options could be facilitated by the involvement of donors, as well as cooperation with existing agencies that provided specific services to non-residents, most notably the Agency for International Trade Information and Cooperation (AITIC) and The Commonwealth Secretariat. The WTO, as an agency, stood ready to work closely with Members on initiatives they might seek to take.","WTCOMTDM35.pdf","Geneva, Week, Commonwealth, Secretariat, Geneva, Agency, for, International, Trade, Information, and, Cooperation, Commonwealth, Secretariat, WTO, Members"

Invited organisations and agencies had given an overview of their methods and mechanisms for building capacity, sharing information and coordinating negotiating positions amongst their constituent members.

Non-residents had been briefed by the Secretariat and the Chairman of the General Council on the process undertaken under the General Council to develop a draft Ministerial Declaration, and on the work that was on-going under the Implementation Review Mechanism. The Chairman of the General Council had also set aside some time to consult directly with non-residents on their concerns and aspirations in relation to the Ministerial Conference, in order to take these into account in the drafting of the Ministerial Declaration. Non-residents had been given extensive briefings on work in the following areas: Agriculture; Services; Intellectual Property; Sanitary and Phyto-Sanitary Measures; Technical Barriers to Trade; Market Access; Trade facilitation; Rules of Origin; Customs Valuation; Trade and Investment; Trade and Competition Policy; and Technical Cooperation and Training. In a number of those areas, non-residents benefitted from complementary presentations made by invited international organisations, and, in the case of briefings on technical cooperation, by bi-lateral partners (the Department for International Development, UK; USAID; and the European Commission's Directorate General for Trade).

The submission by the delegation of Côte d'Ivoire had mentioned the UEMOA Treaty. UNIDO was initiating implementation of an EU/UEMOA/UNIDO initiative in capacity building in the fields of accreditation, standardization and quality promotion aiming at facilitating trade and reducing poverty in West Africa. 12.5 million Euros were available for the eight countries in West Africa. A similar initiative was currently under preparation for 14 other countries and a regional workshop had been held in August 2001. In line with the Millennium Declaration, and based on requests made by the vice-presidents of six Central American countries, UNIDO was designing an integrated programme at the regional level with a view to eliminate non-tariff barriers to trade affecting market access related to the SPS and TBT Agreements. Multilateral organizations had been invited to participate in the context of the High-Level Committee on Programmes meeting of the UN System and Bretton Woods institutions to ensure coordination. UNIDO was working closely with the ITC, with which UNIDO had signed a cooperation agreement a few weeks earlier, and with UNCTAD, FAO and WHO and would welcome WTO participation in such initiatives in the future.

He went on to say that the idea of a WTO Training Institute had come up in the context of better responding to the needs of developing countries in the areas of distance learning, training of trainers as well as enhanced collaboration with universities. Universities were important sources of developing country training and closer relationships between the WTO and universities would enhance knowledge of WTO matters. It was also the idea of providing better services and having a broader outreach to the most relevant ""clientele"". That the Training Institute had been created in June 2001 was not unrelated to financing either. It was believed that, with a Training Institute, it would be easier to seek financing from foundations as the General Council recently had authorized. Private foundations might find it more appealing to fund a Training Institute than a Division of the WTO Secretariat. The Institute, in its current form, was only a first step in what it could become. Well-designed projects had to be developed before additional human and financial resources were sought. Without any additional increase in resources, the Institute was currently preparing pilot projects in various areas for financing. However, the current staff had been working harder since the creation of the Institute to come up with concrete plans and projects to implement the mandate received from the Director-General.","WTCOMTDM35.pdf","WTO, Training, Institute, WTO, WTO, Training, Institute, Training, Institute, General, Council, Training, Institute, WTO, Secretariat, Institute, Institute, Institute, Director-General"

The representative of the Secretariat said that the participants in the trade-policy courses visited WIPO and received a lecture on the TRIPS Agreement and other aspects on TRIPS by WIPO officials for a full day. That was in parallel to the training they received on the same Agreement and in more detail from WTO officials. That cooperation did not go beyond the other existing extensive cooperation between the Intellectual Property Division in the WTO Secretariat and WIPO set out in a special agreement. The collaboration of WIPO had been sought as far as the setting up a distance learning facility was concerned. WIPO had an Academy since mid-2000 and had experience in setting up on-line, computer-based training courses. The WTO Secretariat hoped to benefit from their experience. However, the relations between the WIPO Academy and the WTO Training Institute did not preclude any other activity taking place at the level of the cooperation programme set up between WIPO and the rest of the Secretariat, in particular the Intellectual Property Division and the training that went on in the field and elsewhere.","WTCOMTDM35.pdf","Secretariat, WIPO, WIPO, WTO, Intellectual, Property, Division, WTO, Secretariat, WIPO, WIPO, WIPO, WTO, Secretariat, WIPO, Academy, WTO, Training, Institute, WIPO, Secretariat, Intellectual, Property, Division"

"3359",3359,"112","112. Fifth, the coherence and complementarity between the activities of the Institute and the ones carried out in the field in technical cooperation constituted one of the priorities of the Secretariat. The role of the TAMC, chaired by Deputy Director-General Ravier was to look after the implementation of that priority. There was also the Joint Consultative Board on WTO-related Training which regrouped representatives of UNCTAD, ITC and the World Bank as well as the chairmen of certain WTO bodies such as the Budget Committee, the Committee on Trade and Development and the Sub-Committee on Least-Developed Countries. All these representatives were being contacted with a view to organizing a first meeting before the Fourth Ministerial Meeting. The Joint Consultative Board on WTO-related Training would also have a role to play in the coordination of WTO activities. He ensured delegations that, with respect to on-line training and modern information technologies, there was a pilot project about to be launched and for which financing was sought from Members. Consideration was also given to provide those courses in parallel on CD-ROMs to provide the same material off-line as well. However, CD-ROMs did pose the problem of monitoring and follow-up but the possibility was being studied. With the cooperation of the Technical Cooperation Division, links would be made to all regions as far as the training of trainers, distance learning and contacts with universities were concerned. Since the establishment of the Institute in June 2001, two agreements had been signed with universities on WTO-related training and it was nice to hear at the present meeting that Members were working on the same thing.","WTCOMTDM35.pdf","Institute, Secretariat, TAMC, Director-General, Ravier, Joint, Consultative, Board, UNCTAD, ITC, World, Bank, WTO, Budget, Committee, Committee, on, Trade, and, Development, Joint, Consultative, Board, on, WTO-related, Training, WTO, Members, Technical, Cooperation, Division, Institute, Members"
"3358",3358,"111","111. Fourth, the programme of activities presented by the Training Institute was in line with the new WTO Technical Cooperation Strategy. The fact that there was an addendum to the Strategy containing the plan for technical assistance activities and that the Training Institute had issued a separate document should not be interpreted as expressing a special situation which should be dealt with aside from the Strategy and the other technical cooperation activities. It was only because of the different nature of the activities. Many of the activities of the Training Institute had not yet been financed and as and when funding was found they could be included in the new document to be issued before the end of the year which would be considered by the TAMC at a later date. The Training Institute was an integral part of the Strategy. The reason why the document on the Training Institute referred to a two-year period was that only one fellowship per country could be offered every two years with the current availability of resources. If the Director-General succeeded in his request for doubling the capacity, the Training Institute would also be able to work on a yearly basis. It was clear that there were some overlap and duplication between training and technical cooperation activities. In a somewhat arbitrary but pragmatic manner it had been determined that any activity undertaken in Geneva fell under the Training Institute while all activities in the field belonged to technical cooperation.","WTCOMTDM35.pdf","Training, Institute, WTO, Technical, Cooperation, Strategy, Training, Institute, Training, Institute, TAMC, Training, Institute, Training, Institute, Director-General, Training, Institute, Geneva, Training, Institute"
"3357",3357,"110","110. Third, the document explained what the Institute would be in a position to offer to its beneficiaries in terms of training courses. This ""offer"", which was currently quantitatively quite limited, constituted an initial but modest response to the needs for capacity building. However, it would enable the beneficiaries to plan the training of their officials responsible for WTO matters and it would be important that the beneficiaries indicated, on the basis of that offer, the type of training they wished to receive from the WTO in the future.","WTCOMTDM35.pdf","Institute, WTO, WTO"

"3355",3355,"109","109. Second, certain new activities, especially those relating to distance learning, could not be undertaken unless new sources of financing could be found rapidly. An appeal to donors had been WT/COMTD/M/35 Page 28 launched. However, a balance had to be struck between increased human resources (funds for new trainers for example), increased financial resources (funds for additional fellowships for example), and improvements to or new acquisitions of the training equipment (such as new training rooms). Some concrete proposals to that effect would soon be presented, in the context of but not exclusively when the draft 2002 budget was to be presented.","WTCOMTDM35.pdf",""
"3354",3354,"108","108. The Director of the WTO Training Institute said that, as Members would recall, they had already been informed, during a recent session of the General Council, of the decision by the Director-General to reorganize the Training Division of the WTO Secretariat. That division had become the WTO Training Institute. The document before Members presented the future activities of the Institute which went beyond the trade-policy courses organized up to then by the Training Division. The new activities included training of trainers, a range of short-term courses, distance- learning services as well as extended cooperation with universities and other educational establishments. To introduce the document, he wished to make the following remarks. First, financing had not yet been assured for some of the scheduled activities as they would largely depend on extra budgetary resources. However, he was confident that some donors would continue to contribute as some of the activities had become ""traditional"" in the training programme. That was for example the case of the programmes for the LDCs as well as the training on rules and procedures of the dispute settlement system. He took the opportunity to thank the donors who continued to support the training activities.","WTCOMTDM35.pdf","Director, WTO, Training, Institute, Members, General, Council, Director-General, WTO, Secretariat, WTO, Training, Institute, Members, Institute"

There had been questions of supply-side responses and those related to mainstreaming as the WTO did not have country-offices and could only work at two levels to address the supply-side issues: with the bilateral donors and with other agencies (World Bank, IMF and UNDP in particular). Bilateral donors had begun to dedicate more resources to supply-side responses and had been showing the way for the new WTO Strategy. Turning to technical cooperation in Geneva which some delegations had mentioned he said that time and resources of the Secretariat were dedicated to providing technical assistance to the entire Membership. Attention had also been given to non-residents for the past three years. On JITAP he said that the WTO continued to provide technical assistance in the tripartite collaboration with ITC and UNCTAD. There was a clearly designed programme for the WTO modules in the JITAP programme. JITAP had been designed to come to an end at the end of 2001 even as a consolidation programme was under way. It was a matter for donors to decide what to do with the JITAP. The Secretariat had been asked informally to see how the JITAP and the IF could be merged, not necessarily involving the disappearance of the JITAP which was a successful and robust programme that had worked well at the grass-root level. The Secretariat would have to come back to Members as the negotiations between beneficiaries and donors evolved. The point hat had been made about reconciling regional programmes related to regional integration agreements with the WTO technical assistance. That was what the Secretariat wished to achieve as could be seen in the Annexes and in working with various other international and regional organizations. Djibouti would be included in the list of Arab countries. That had already been pointed out by a colleague who had been specifically recruited to work on Arab countries. The Secretariat would take the comments made by delegations into account when implementing the Strategy.","WTCOMTDM35.pdf","CTD, TAMC, WTO, World, Bank, IMF, UNDP, WTO, Strategy, Geneva, Secretariat, WTO, ITC, UNCTAD, WTO, Secretariat, Secretariat, Members, WTO, Secretariat, Djibouti, Secretariat"
"3351",3351,"105","105. He continued by saying that there had been several questions about how the various approaches would relate to the Strategy. The Secretariat believed that it should proceed on the basis of a tools-box approach. Some of the approaches could not be reconciled, but that only meant that they operated on different tracks. What the Secretariat would endeavour to do was that, with respect to specific elements and depending on the national situation, a particular approach, for instance the agreement-by-agreement approach, would be applied to advance a particular aspect of the Strategy. Some delegations had mentioned the varying national needs and those were covered in Section III of the Plan which contained a design of country-specific technical assistance, essentially based on demands made to the Secretariat. That individual developing countries had different needs was the rationale behind the separate section focussing on country-specific activities. There had been some comments as to what the WTO technical assistance should do and it had been mentioned that it would be judged by the extent to which it assisted developing countries increase their share of world trade,                                                                                    WT/COMTD/M/35                                                                                           Page 27 not just in the multilateral trading system but also in the global economy. That was why one of the core elements was mainstreaming and why WTO had to work with other international agencies.","WTCOMTDM35.pdf","Secretariat, Secretariat, Secretariat, WTO, WTO"
"3350",3350,"104","104. The Director of the Technical Cooperation Division said that the Secretariat had appreciated the constructive comments made by delegations which would guide the Secretariat in the implementation of the new Strategy. With respect to the implementation of the new Strategy he said that as soon as Members had taken note of it, the Secretariat would collate the views expressed and intended to take up the practical issues that would arise, not only within the Technical Cooperation Division, but also make an appropriate presentation to the TAMC. He proposed that the Secretariat proceed with the conclusion of the tripartite, and in some cases, the quadrilateral MoUs referred to (quadrilateral with regard to the MoU with the Arab region). There had been a suggestion for the inclusion of the Economic Commission for Africa for the Arab region. The Secretariat would begin to develop, on a more systematic basis, and refine the Coordinated Plan for WTO Technical Assistance. The Plan would be revised for the year 2002 and that would be the test on the basis of which Members should judge the Secretariat's implementation of the Strategy. The Coordinated Plan should reflect the Strategy and the comments made by Members. Several delegations had mentioned the issue of mainstreaming. There was a limit to the delivery of WTO technical assistance as a mechanism for mainstreaming trade-priorities into strategies for poverty reduction and development plans. In pursuing that objective, the Secretariat would be operating within an inter-agency framework. The reason the WTO Secretariat had to work with the other agencies was the guidance Members had given. Although trade was recognized as an engine for growth within the more development-oriented institutions, trade-components were not normally ensured parts of development plans. What the Membership had told the Secretariat was that the WTO, as a primary trade institution, should champion the integration of trade priority areas of action into development plans. The Secretariat would be doing as it had been mandated, taking into account that mainstreaming should be less abstract and more nationally oriented.","WTCOMTDM35.pdf","Director, Technical, Cooperation, Division, Secretariat, Secretariat, Members, Secretariat, Technical, Cooperation, Division, TAMC, Secretariat, MoUs, Economic, Commission, Africa, Secretariat, WTO, Members, Secretariat, Members, WTO, Secretariat, WTO, Secretariat, Members, Secretariat, WTO, Secretariat"
"3349",3349,"103","103. The representative of Morocco said that his delegation was happy with the implementation of the new approach proposed in the Strategy which it hoped would respond to the expectations of developing and LDCs as technical assistance was crucial for the effective implementation of WTO Agreements. To date, the assistance provided had only provided information instead of a true training of trainers. The new Strategy seemed to rectify that situation and permit real capacity building. As far as financing was concerned, it was clear that enhanced predictability would give more substance to the new approach. The new approach regarding national focal points was essential. It was currently a substantial gap between the different technical departments involved in WTO matters. The identification of focal points would result in enhanced local coordination. The new approach would also reinforce regional integration. As far as cooperation with universities was concerned, his delegation reiterated its proposal to organize, in collaboration with the Secretariat, a third cycle of specific studies of WTO-specific issues. That initiative could be carried out within an African framework in order for African students to familiarize themselves with WTO matters.","WTCOMTDM35.pdf","Morocco, LDCs, WTO, WTO, Secretariat, WTO"
"3348",3348,"102","102. The representative of Norway said that the principle of comparative advantage often was stressed in the WTO and that it should guide the WTO's work on technical assistance as well. However, no matter how important the issue of technical assistance and capacity building was, the WTO should not primarily become a development organization. Coherence was important. The WTO had a role to play together with other relevant organizations, and not the least, with national governments. One of the main weaknesses of the current regime was the lack of predictable financing and the following ad-hoc character of some technical assistance provided. An increase in the regular WT/COMTD/M/35 Page 26 budget, allowing for more predictable technical assistance did not necessarily mean increased costs for all Members. That was a technical issue that could be addressed in its own way.","WTCOMTDM35.pdf","Norway, WTO, WTO, WTO, WTO, Members"
"3347",3347,"101","101. The representative of Côte d'Ivoire said that his delegation accepted the excuse by the Chairman. However, every time there was an important document to discuss, it seemed to be available in English only. The fact that the document was only available in English made the work more difficult for his delegation. His delegation supported what had been said by the representative of the European Communities. Even though all developing countries faced difficulties, the type of difficulties varied from country to country which made it necessary for any technical assistance provided to be targeted at the specific needs of each country. His delegation had asked for assistance in customs-valuation as the customs authorities in his country faced problems in the application of certain texts adopted at the WTO because of a lack of training of customs officials. That was what he meant by targeted tailor-made training which could even be given in the country itself. Ideally, a certain degree of coherence should be guaranteed between the technical assistance given at the sub- regional level where countries were in the process of integrating. Sub-regional technical assistance programmes could then be harmonized with WTO technical assistance. The usefulness of technical assistance provided could otherwise diminish. It was important that the support for the JITAP be maintained and consolidated for it to be extended. Some had already benefitted from the JITAP while others were still to benefit. The document, although interesting, was yet not complete. He therefore suggested that once specific technical assistance programmes had been decided upon, there would be the possibility for the concerned Members to discuss them with the Secretariat in order to make the technical assistance provided as effective as possible.","WTCOMTDM35.pdf","Côte, d'Ivoire, Chairman, WTO, WTO, Members, Secretariat"

Referring to a number of products covered by the scheme, he noted that it went beyond the EBA-initiative of the EC in that it included revolvers and pistols.

The information supplied in the CTD was only the annex to an Act. In order to verify if the scheme satisfied all the conditions for a GSP scheme, it would be useful to have a copy of the Act itself.

"3331",3331,"99","99.      The Director, Development Division thanked delegations for all the comments. It was important to be clear that the document WT/COMTD/W/85 was not an attempt to repeat the information in WT/COMTD/W/77 which listed the complete range of 145 provisions of S&D treatment contained in the WTO Agreements. The current document only showed where there the S&D provisions with respect to which there had been proposals or action taken. If there were no new developments since the previous document, the provision had not been included. For example, in textiles, there had been no new work and no new proposals made so the S&D provisions with respect to textiles were not covered. That approach should perhaps have stated more clearly. The Secretariat would look at the services section again to try to be more helpful to the delegations in linking precise used had originally been set up for the High Level Symposium on Trade and Development in 1999. Provisions on transfer of technology would, generally, fall under one of the categories of S&D, most likely under the ""provisions aimed at increasing trade opportunities for developing country Members"". The treatment of LDCs was cross-cutting because all fields had provisions specifically related to LDCs. However, the Secretariat could do some work in that area. The representative of India had asked to keep the issue open. However, it was difficult to produce updates for every meeting of the Committee but the Secretariat would see what could be done. With respect to the point made in the second intervention by the representative of Pakistan, he said that the only objective of the document had been to provide information on what measures had been taken to operationalize S&D treatment provisions. If the document could make a positive contribution to the debate in the CTD or the General Council, then that was valuable. He took note of the point by the representative of Canada that the document could also show what S&D provisions had not been implemented and what S&D provisions had not been used.","WTCOMTDM34.pdf","Director, Development, Division, WTO, Secretariat, S&D, Members, Secretariat, India, Committee, Secretariat, Pakistan, CTD, General, Council, Canada"

Recently, there had been a seminar at the WTO in collaboration with UNCTAD and other organizations, on the transfer of technology. One of the conclusions was that provisions of technology in the WTO Agreement had not yet been implemented. The document on S&D treatment showed that technology transfer existed in one or other of the six categories on S&D. In the Services Agreement, under paragraph 1 of Article 4, there was a reference to the need to strengthen national capacity in Services, which could be achieved through access to technology. However, the Secretariat had included that in the category ""provisions aimed at increasing the trade opportunities of developing country Members"". Article 66.2 of the TRIPS Agreement also stated that developed countries should transfer technology to the LDCs and the Secretariat had included that article on the transfer of technology among the provisions related to LDCs. Provisions related to the transfer of technology thus appeared in various categories. He asked whether if would not be wise to create a new category on technology transfer, as it deserved, given its importance. However, other delegations might prefer to keep the six existing categories.","WTCOMTDM34.pdf","Uruguay, Secretariat, WTO, UNCTAD, WTO, S&D, Secretariat, Members, LDCs, Secretariat"

So she had now re-read document WT/COMTD/W/77 in depth and tried to understand what had been proposed and what had been done. She said that she had been struck by how much had been done and the fact that the opportunities in the S&D treatment provisions had not been fully used.

The representative of Morocco said that he was of the view that the implementation of S&D treatment had not been sufficient to balance the rights and obligations of each Member. S&D treatment had not spared the economies of LDCs from marginalization. Furthermore, although S&D was an indispensable tool, it had to go far enough for people to see their commitments fulfilled.

The discussions in the CTD and those which had taken place elsewhere showed that there was a considerable body of opinion among Members pointing to the need to rethink and fine-tune the concept of S&D treatment to make it more responsive to the specific constraints faced by developing countries in their integration into the multilateral trading system and the implementation of trade policy reform.

Document WT/COMTD/W/85 was the most recent in a series of documents reflecting the state of discussions on S&D treatment. The document followed the same pattern used in the previous document (WT/COMTD/W/77) and contained two main elements. First, it updated information which had been provided in WT/COMTD/W/77 on the implementation of S&D provisions, covering developments through the Autumn 2000 and Spring 2001 in the following Agreements, Understandings, and Decisions: the Understanding on Balance-of-Payments Provisions, the Agreement on Agriculture, the Decision Concerning the Possible Negative Effects of the Reform Programme on Least-Developed and Net-Food Importing Developing Countries, the SPS Agreement, the TBT Agreement, the Anti-Dumping Agreement, the Subsidies Agreement, the GATS (references had been made to the guidelines and procedures established by the GATS Council in document S/L/93), the TRIPS Agreement, and the Decision on Measures in Favour of Least-Developed Countries. Second, Section III of the document referred specifically to written proposals related to S&D treatment which were made by Members in the negotiations on agriculture in a recent special session of the Committee on Agriculture and statements made at that meeting. The paper gave a clear and graphic view of developments in the discussion on S&D treatment, which was engaged in relation to all agreements and Ministerial decisions. The objective of the paper was also to provide useful background information for Members' discussions on the future development of S&D. WT/COMTD/M/34 Page 14 The Committee should certainly not pre-empt the work of the General Council, it should rather feed into the discussions under the oversight of the General Council.","WTCOMTDM34.pdf","Director, Development, Division, Secretariat, GSP, Reform, Programme, GATS, Council, Members, Committee, on, Agriculture, Members, Committee, General, Council, General, Council"
"3314",3314,"83","83.     The Chairman said that for Agenda Item F, a document entitled ""Special And Differential Treatment: Implementation and Proposals"" (WT/COMTD/W/85) had been prepared by the Secretariat. The discussion in the CTD was not intended to duplicate the implementation-related work going on in the General Council. Nevertheless, the Secretariat paper contained interesting material which the CTD could discuss as an input to Members' thinking in the wider context of the future of S&D provisions in the WTO Agreements.","WTCOMTDM34.pdf","Chairman, Secretariat, CTD, General, Council, Secretariat, CTD, Members, WTO"
"3313",3313,"82","82.     The Director, Development Division thanked all the delegations which had spoken and for the understanding that allowed the text to go forward. On the question about the next stages, the PrepCom Bureau was very keen to keep the WTO involved and recognized that there was a kind of overlapping process with the preparation of Doha, as the WTO priority. At the same time, their views were focused on March 2002. The next stage would be in September when the facilitator was to present his first draft of what may be called a ""draft outcome"" and he would ensure that that document was circulated to Members.","WTCOMTDM34.pdf","Director, Development, Division, PrepCom, Bureau, WTO, Doha, WTO, Members"
"3312",3312,"81","81.      The Chairman expressed his appreciation to Members who had cooperated in the finalization of the text. The work of the Preparatory Committee would continue through to the Conference, and the CTD might wish to revert to the matter later in the year. He asked the Secretariat to keep the CTD informed about any developments and it was open to any Member to raise the matter further at any future meeting.     The next meeting of the Preparatory Committee was scheduled for 15-19 October 2001.","WTCOMTDM34.pdf","Chairman, Members, Preparatory, Committee, CTD, Secretariat, CTD, Member, Preparatory, Committee"

The representative of European Communities thanked those delegations which had made an effort to let the text go forward and had limited themselves to placing their views on the record of the CTD. That was a welcome approach. However, his delegation still believed that the document – although not perfect – was a useful contribution to the discussions, and he was pleased to be able to provide a collective input to the Conference, while recognizing that not every word was acceptable for everybody. He asked what the next stages of the process were.","WTCOMTDM34.pdf","European, Communities, CTD"

"3309",3309,"79","79.      The representative of Cuba said that her delegation did not agree with the contribution in document WT/COMTD/30. She said she wished to state the disappointment of the Cuban authorities concerning the content of the document. The WTO contribution should have been more substantive, reflecting the real issues which developing countries face in international trade. The document should not have been limited to identifying the problems being faced at present, but should have defined the means to reverse the existing situation. The report should have been more critical as regards the role developed countries could and should play in supporting development. The solutions proposed, which imposed obligations on developing countries to create internal resources, did not take into account the situation which developing countries faced, nor the diversity of these problems. Her delegation did not believe that there was a direct or automatic relationship between trade liberalization at the international level and the promotion of economic growth. She reserved her delegation's right in forthcoming meetings and at the Conference on Financing for Development to set out her Government's views with regard to what should have been part of the WTO's contribution.

The representative of Saint Lucia said that her delegation was interested in the Conference on Financing for Development and was glad that the WTO had been able to make a contribution, although her delegation would preferred a more ambitious statement, reflecting her government's particular concerns. However, she understood that it was a political statement which had been well received in New York. She asked for Mr. Tulloch's statement to be distributed.","WTCOMTDM34.pdf","Saint, Lucia, WTO, New, York, Tulloch"
"3307",3307,"77","77.      The representative of Turkey expressed his appreciation to the Chair, as well as the Secretariat and the Committee, for the great efforts which enabled the CTD to deliver the contribution of the WTO to the UN PrepCom for the Conference on Financing for Development. It had not been easy to conclude a consensus text containing different varieties of issues which were important for all. Indeed, his delegation was still not happy with the language used in one sentence in paragraph 11 which stated that ""… many Members consider that reduction of high tariffs, tariff peaks and tariff escalation would benefit a number of areas of export interest to developing countries, including, for example, in textiles and clothing, where in addition the main liberalisation agreed in the Uruguay Round has yet to take place."" His delegation was certainly not one of the Members mentioned in that sentence, but had an opposite view on the matter. However, his delegation had not wanted to insist on a position which would have prolonged the debate unnecessarily and had remained silent during the discussions. He appreciated the opportunity to express his delegation's concern on that subject which would also be discussed in the preparation for the Ministerial.","WTCOMTDM34.pdf","Turkey, Secretariat, Committee, CTD, WTO, UN, Members, Uruguay, Round, Members"

For that meeting, the Facilitator would present a ""first draft"" of a ""final outcome"" for consideration by members of the PrepCom; that paper should be available by the end of September. The Bureau of the Financing for Development Conference was very much concerned that the WTO should remain engaged in the PrepCom process. In parallel to the PrepCom, a high level panel appointed by the UN Secretary-General and headed by former President Zedillo of Mexico was preparing a report which was scheduled to be available by the end of May. This would also be posted on the FFD website when it became available. Finally, he emphasized that the day before the Preparatory Committee meeting started, the annual high level exchange of views between the international financial institutions and ECOSOC had been held and it had been strongly suggested that the WTO be involved in the corresponding event in 2002.","WTCOMTDM34.pdf","Preparatory, Committee, Financing, for, Development, Conference, WTO, UN, Zedillo, Mexico, Preparatory, Committee, ECOSOC, WTO"
"3304",3304,"74","74.     The meeting recognized that there were two overlapping processes in the preparation of the WTO Ministerial Conference and the Preparatory Process for the FFD Conference. Great emphasis was put by all speakers, and, in particular the Group of 77, on trade as the most important element in external financing for development. It was universally recognised that the most important thing for WT/COMTD/M/34 Page 12 the trading system as a whole was that there should be a successful outcome at Doha, and the WTO must therefore concentrate on the successful preparation of the Doha meeting.","WTCOMTDM34.pdf","WTO, Doha, WTO, Doha"
"3303",3303,"73","73.      In respect of trade, the paper posed eight sets of questions: (i) how to support the enhancement of the development dimension of multilateral trade agreements; (ii) how to deepen the political momentum towards ensuring full market access of LDCs' exports to the markets industrialized countries; (iii) how best to enhance the contribution of regional and sub-regional cooperation and integration as building blocks to global trade and development; (iv) how to strengthen the contribution of the World Bank, governments, donors and other financial development institutions in support of diversified export capacity; (v) how to strengthen the existing international mechanism for compensatory balance-of-payments support in times of price shocks; (vi) how relevant international organizations could support developing countries by providing access to risk management instruments to cope with a persistent terms of trade decline and commodity prices instability; (vii) how international organizations could contribute to improve market access for the developing countries; and, (viii) what steps should be taken on a priority basis to match the requirements of technical and financial assistance for capacity building, including areas such as trade negotiations and dispute settlement, as well as, supporting implementation and how to support the Integrated Framework for LDCs and build that experience for enhancing the coherence of trade capacity building for other developing overlapping countries.","WTCOMTDM34.pdf","World, Bank, LDCs"
"3302",3302,"72","72.      The main discussion at the meeting had been on a paper presented by the Facilitator, Mr. Mauricio Escanero of Mexico, focussing on five cross-cutting issues. The first was global coherence in support financing for development, where the paper saw the challenge as how to embrace the coherence and consistency of the international monetary, financial, and trading systems in support of development. Second, on participation and ownership, the paper stated that enhancing was an important step to achieve the effective participation of the developing countries in relevant international decision-making on norm-setting as well as policy implementation. The paper emphasized the need to ensure responsiveness to the requirements of developing countries, and, in particular, the special needs of Africa, the least-developed countries, small and developing states, land-locked and transit developing countries, as well as countries with economies in transition. These have special difficulties in attracting finance for development. Lastly, they were promoting public/private partnerships in supporting the financing for development.","WTCOMTDM34.pdf","Mauricio, Escanero, Mexico, Africa"
"3301",3301,"71","71.     The main substantive decision of the PrepCom was that the International Conference on Financing for Development would take place in Monterrey in Mexico on 18-22 March 2002. The meeting would have three segments: (i) a High-Level Official meeting; (ii) a Ministerial meeting where the Governments would be invited to send what was described as fully integrated delegations with representatives from all relevant national ministries; and, (iii) a summit meeting. All this information could be found on the UN website (http://www.un.org/esa/ffd). The members of the PrepCom very much welcomed the fact that WTO Members had been able to agree on a common statement, and they welcomed the fact that the statement had been delivered to the meeting.","WTCOMTDM34.pdf","Financing, for, Development, Monterrey, Mexico, UN, WTO, Members"
"3300",3300,"70","70.     The Director, Development Division, said that he had been present at the Preparatory Committee (PrepCom) meeting on 3 and 4 May. The main discussion on trade issues was held on Friday, 4 May, but he had been invited to speak on 3 May to present the WTO Members' input. He was also asked to speak on institutional aspects of ""coherence"" and the WTO's relationship with the UN system.

The Chairman said that there were four outstanding requests for observer status on an ad hoc basis from the League of Arab States, OPEC, the Gulf Organization for Industrial Consulting and the Organisation Internationale de la Francophonie. Informal consultations had been held and it did not, as yet, appear to be a consensus on these requests. He therefore proposed to pass to the next item.","WTCOMTDM34.pdf","Chairman, League, of, Arab, States, OPEC, Gulf, Organization, for, Industrial, Consulting, Organisation, Internationale, de, la, Francophonie"
"3298",3298,"69","69.     The Chairman said that the International Conference on Financing for Development was scheduled for March 2002. Following extensive formal and informal consultations, it had been possible to accept the text contained in document WT/COMTD/30. He expressed his appreciation for the cooperation of Members and for the hard work put in right up to the final hours before the New York meeting to arrive at an acceptable document. He reminded Members that the text was in the form of a political statement, and did not constitute a binding legal commitment on Members. However, since the document was accepted by correspondence, it was fair to allow an opportunity for comments in the CTD for the record. The Members' contribution was taken to the Preparatory                                                                                    WT/COMTD/M/34                                                                                           Page 11 Committee for the meeting in New York on 2-8 May by Mr. Tulloch, Director, Development Division.","WTCOMTDM34.pdf","Chairman, Members, New, York, Members, Members, CTD, Members, Page, 11, Committee, New, York, Tulloch, Director"

The representative of India said that he sought clarification from the representative of Norway on whether their GSP scheme would become effective from 1 July 2002 or whether there were any transition periods. Secondly, the representative of the EC had said that he hoped that, apart from developed countries, developing countries would also extend market access for LDCs. In that respect, it should be noted that, in terms of imports from LDCs as a percentage of total imports, Thailand and India were the top two counties.","WTCOMTDM34.pdf","India, Norway, EC, Thailand, India"

He hoped others would follow the good examples. It was important to make market access predictable and for LDCs to use this market access and less stringent rules of origin to attract foreign investment. That might have been what Mr. Ricupero had referred to WT/COMTD/M/34 Page 10 in the JAG Report. Blending market access, harmonization of rules of origin and less stringent standards would be one important part of the developmental dimension mentioned at the Third UN Conference on the LDCs.

It was important to implement the decisions taken.

However, it was from implementation that LDCs would draw the maximum benefit from the Conference. Importance had to be given to the reinforcement of the production capacity of the LDCs in order for them to benefit from improved market access. The Conference had seen a useful report on the reinforcement of the Integrated Framework. The question of how to facilitate accession to the WTO for the LDCs had also been taken up. At the Doha Ministerial Conference, there should be agreement on assistance for development and trade, in particular for the LDCs.

He also thanked UNCTAD for the excellent preparation which had ensured the success of the Conference. The Conference was not an end itself, but the start of the process which should lead to many initiatives in favour of the least-developed countries. He was pleased to hear about the initiative announced by the representative of Norway. The Government of Norway had also played a crucial role in the concluding of the trade chapter and Plan of Action. Trade had figured prominently on the agenda of the Conference. There had been a thematic session on trade, there was a chapter on trade in the Plan of Action and a paragraph in the political declaration. The Declaration contained a political commitment by all countries having participated in the Conference to emphasize the development's dimension of trade in favour of the LDCs. The Fourth WTO Ministerial Conference in Doha would be an additional opportunity to show how the trade dimension could be reinforced for the LDCs. The LDC Conference had not been an end, but the start of a process, with the forthcoming WTO Ministerial Conference as its next stage.","WTCOMTDM34.pdf","Egypt, European, Union, Parliament, UNCTAD, Norway, Norway, LDCs, WTO, Ministerial, Conference, Doha, WTO, Ministerial, Conference"

The Third Ministerial Conference on the LDCs had approved two important documents: the first was a Political Declaration summarising actions in favour of the LDCs, and the second, a Plan of Action for 2001-2010 which contained a commitment number 5 which dealt with trade and which had to be implemented by the LDCs as well as all those associated with their development. Participants at the Conference had committed themselves to implement fully, on a priority basis, special and differential (S&D) treatment for LDCs as it emerged from the results of the Uruguay Round. GSP schemes would continue to be improved in favour of the LDCs and technical assistance would be provided for the implementation of multilateral agreements. There was also a specific chapter on accessions to the WTO, which referred to the facilitation of the process for the least-developed countries. In addition, there were chapters on commodities, regional agreements, etc., but he wished to dwell on the chapter on market access, where the commitment was to increase and improve access to markets for LDCs, making certain that all the products exported by LDCs entered the markets of the developed countries duty- and quota-free. The primary responsibility was thus on developed countries to improve the access to their markets for products coming from LDCs.

The action plan was realistic and a good basis for inverting the negative tendencies in international trade but required political will on the part of both the developed countries and developing countries.","WTCOMTDM34.pdf","Uruguay, EC, LDCs, Uruguay, GSP, LDCs, WTO, LDCs"
"3280",3280,"52","52.     The representative to the European Communities said that the EC also had made changes to its GSP scheme although those were not yet officially notified. The Political Declaration adopted at the recently held Third UN Conference on the LDCs1, which took place in Brussels from 14-20 May 2001, contained the following paragraph dealing with trade:         "" We believe that increased trade is essential for the growth and development of         LDCs. A transparent, non-discriminatory and rules-based multilateral trading system         is essential for LDCs to reap the potential benefits of globalisation. The accession of         LDCs to the WTO should be encouraged and facilitated. We commit ourselves to         seizing the opportunity of the fourth WTO Ministerial meeting in Doha in         November 2001, to advance the development dimension of trade, in particular for the         development of LDCs. We aim at improving preferential market access for LDCs by         working towards the objective of duty-free and quota-free market access for all         LDCs´ products in the markets of developed countries. Measures will also be taken         to address problems caused by supply-side constraints. The crucial importance of         trade and economic growth must be reflected in poverty reduction strategies."" The Plan of Action2 adopted at that same conference spelled out commitments in more detail, covering market access, technical assistance, services, the accession of WTO and regional trade. All that documentation would be made available as an official contribution for WTO approval as soon as possible. The text just read out showed the momentum to get to a situation where essentially all products were included in the scheme. The result of the LDC Conference was in line with the thinking which a number of delegations had developed in the CTD and also in the rest of the WTO lately. His delegation intended to build on that. Additional market access commitments would be welcomed, not only from developed countries, but from all WTO Members.","WTCOMTDM34.pdf","European, Communities, EC, UN, Conference, Brussels, LDCs, WTO, WTO, Doha, WTO, WTO, CTD, WTO, WTO, Members"

She was aware that the Japanese GSP scheme was governed by the Enabling Clause, which specially stated that a reduction of duties could be undertaken by a particular country in favour of LDCs. However, the Enabling Clause also stated that the removal of non-tariff barriers should be undertaken in consultation with other Members and Japan had not consulted other Members as they were obliged to. Her delegation was concern about that kind of development in the WTO. She recognized the concerns of LDCs, but there were certain countries which did not belong to the LDC category, which still shared some of the criteria for special treatment. She was aware that the Sub-Committee on LDCs was discussing these issues in detail, but the CTD was the major body of the LDCs Sub-Committee. She therefore sought clarification from the Secretariat as to whether there was a precedent where countries had modified or introduced GSP schemes had held consultations before introducing the system.","WTCOMTDM34.pdf","Sri, Lanka, GSP, Members, Japan, Members, WTO, CTD, LDCs, Sub-Committee, Secretariat"

His Government believed that Japan's GSP had contributed to promote exports as well as growth of export incomes in developing countries. There seemed to be general consensus among the international community that GSP schemes be maintained and improved. Market access for LDCs was an issue that should be addressed, as at the recent UN Conference on LDCs in Brussels. His government had decided to extend the effective period of its GSP scheme by 10 years until 31 March 2011. The new GSP scheme which had been implemented since 1 April 2001 extended preferences for LDCs, making about 360 items duty-free.","WTCOMTDM34.pdf","Japan, US, GSP, Japan, GSP, GSP, LDCs, UN, Conference, on, LDCs, Brussels"

On the questions of rules of origin, there was nothing new in the notification. The US would provide a list of the beneficiaries for the Secretariat to circulate. The number of beneficiaries could hopefully be expanded. The discussion with respect to the notification for LDCs was similar to some of the discussions that took place when the U.S. delegation had announced its textiles liberalization at the end of 1994, in that a number of developing countries argued that the quota system provided guaranteed market access since they could not compete with larger developing countries in the textiles field. It was interesting to see that same dynamic in the request by the representative of Sri Lanka that the Secretariat conduct a study of the effects of preference programmes on other developing countries. Her delegation did not yet have a position on whether to conduct such a study, and wished to know more about it. The Chairman might inquiry informally about how such a study would be conducted. By the end of the year the US Government would have provided up to nearly US$2 million to the WTO specifically for capacity building efforts in Africa. The U.S. Government was constantly sending teams of expert to Africa to look at customs procedures and explain the implementation of the AGOA. She could provide a list of the number of teams sent to Africa to provide technical assistance, and she hoped that the AGOA might become a model for the U.S. Government for other developing countries. She would convey Zambia's comments on the AGOA seminar to Washington, and thanked the Secretariat for its help in conducting that seminar.

Consultations had been held in February 2001 and it had been agreed that terms of reference would be drawn up as a basis for a study to be conducted by the                                                                                       WT/COMTD/M/34                                                                                              Page 35 Secretariat.

He was convinced that there was no good strategy without flexibility. Nor was there a good strategy without organization. In consequence, it was necessary to find proper means to balance those two constraints. The equilibrium between the planned activities and the ad hoc activities, reflecting flexibility, was not satisfactory because it depended on first-come, first-served: when there was money a request was accepted, otherwise the WTO had to say no. This was neither strategy, nor management, nor an intelligent way of tackling a problem such as technical assistance. This had to be tackled. On the other hand, he was not in favour of doing without the ad hoc activities: there must be a margin for manoeuvre. The US representative had asked whether in a Ministerial periods, such as this year, there was an increase in requests of an ad hoc nature as concerns negotiation techniques, and the reply was affirmative. So when there was a Ministerial Conference, there was a need for additional flexibility. The Secretariat would take into account all that had been said. He noted that Members thought the questionnaire was not a bad approach. He hoped to be able to show improvements in the strategic orientation as soon as possible or for the next CTD in October.","WTCOMTDM34.pdf","Director-General, Ravier, WTO, US, Secretariat, Members, CTD"

"3229",3229,"170","170.     The representative of Malaysia said that basically, for Malaysia, what was important was that any strategy on technical assistance should ensure that the needs of Members were met, and this could linked to improving the capacity of members in the WTO, particularly in the implementation of the WTO agreements. In this respect, the strategy paper, whether it be shorter or longer-term should address priorities, based on Members needs, which could be determined either with the questionnaire or through consultations with Members. Second, there was a need to address issues related to resources. Third, regarding the delivery of technical assistance, this could be done by focussing on agreements, but some macro aspects of technical assistance could be covered in the trade policy courses which were cross-cutting in nature. Finally, there was a need to address coherence among institutions delivering the technical assistance so it is to avoid duplication. He also supported the need for flexibility in the three-year plan.

Needless to say, some countries had not been able to respond to the questionnaire, due to limited capacity and resources. She would not do way with the questionnaire since it was useful, but a mix of measures was needed to arrive at an agreed plan. Secondly, with regard to sources of funding, Barbados had always been very concerned with the extent of voluntary funds, and was quite glad to hear the U.S. and the EC specifically say that they would try to diminish the ear-marking of their contribution. Clearly, what needs to happen is that regular fund contribution should be increased, and should not be subject to conditionalities. Rather it should respond to priorities established in an objective way. On the question of priorities, there was a general principle that all beneficiary countries had access resources but it was clear that priorities must be set in order to achieve maximum results from available resources. Her delegation fully supported the different sets of priorities identified by the Secretariat in the strategy document. Some good work had gone into this document, while the plan would need to be reviewed. She was not so sure that it was necessary to shorten any of the document: details were important in the exercise. Barbados would like to be involved in any consultations that might be held on the issue.","WTCOMTDM34.pdf","Barbados, Barbados, U.S., EC, Secretariat, Barbados"

The representative of Cuba supported Uruguay, Peru, Guatemala and others on the need for flexibility in the application of the plan to be responsive to the needs of the Member countries. Techncial assistance should be demand-driven, since the Member countries know, best know their own needs in order to be able to participate ever more fully in the multilateral trading system. Cuba was in favour of the participation of all the Divisions of the secretariat in technical assistance. Cuba was very concerned at the conditions for granting technical assistance, as in other fields, and rejected any kind of discrimination towards Member countries in WTO because non-discrimination was a key principle of the WTO. One of the principles of WTO was to grant technical assistance to all countries, in particular to the least-developed countries, in order to help them all fulfill their obligations and attain their rights.","WTCOMTDM34.pdf","Cuba, Uruguay, Peru, Guatemala, Member, Member, Cuba, Cuba, Member, WTO, WTO, WTO"

"3224",3224,"166","166.     The representative of India thanked the DDG for his presentation of the three exhaustive documents prepared by the Secretariat. It was useful to prepare the three-year plan on technical assistance on the basis of the replies to questionnaires. However, after a lapse of time, some flexibility was important. He agreed with other delegations that technical assistance should be determined by the beneficiaries themselves. Keeping in view the excessive demand for the 12 week Trade Policy Courses conducted by the WTO, some importance could usefully be given to the short-term courses organized outside Geneva. He noted on page 31 of the Secretariat document on technical assistance activities, that the first WTO ESCAP trade policy course and WTO and multilateral trading system for Asian developing economies had been held in Bangkok from 8 to 26 May 2000. In the three-year plan, its duration had been curtailed in 2001, 2002 and 2003. He asked why the duration of this course had been halved. This TPC outside Geneva should supplement the main WTO trade policy course, and, hence, it would be useful if the duration was not curtailed. He also asked about the modalities for nominations to this course, in particular, whether the                                                                                      WT/COMTD/M/34                                                                                             Page 33 nominations were handled by ESCAP Secretariat. Before closing, he wanted to join other delegations with the request that each developing country and economy in transition, held one place per year in the 12 week residential trade policy course. This could not be replaced by regional seminars on trade policy, other trade policy courses and workshops, bearing in mind the intensity of the trade residential courses and the benefits available to the participants by way of access to the WTO Library and other connected international intergovernmental organizations in Geneva. He hoped that a favourable solution could be found to the Director-General's proposal on doubling the capacity of the residential courses. He also hoped that the problem of adequate budget resources could be sorted out soon. He agreed with Venezuela and others that should be continuous evaluation of the technical assistance activities by the CTD.","WTCOMTDM34.pdf","India, Secretariat, WTO, Geneva, Secretariat, WTO, ESCAP, WTO, Bangkok, Geneva, WTO, ESCAP, Secretariat, WTO, Library, Geneva, Director-General, Venezuela, CTD"
"3223",3223,"165","165.     The representative of Guatemala said that the strategy should be a factual, specific document, but it should also be flexible. It was impossible to summarize in 40 pages the entire strategy for technical assistance in WTO for the next few years. As concerned the establishment of priorities, as Uruguay had said, Guatemala was also concerned about who was to decide the priorities. Members stated the priorities on training matters. The triennial plan was useful, but maybe it should only be for one or two years, instead of three years as now. The type of had hoc assistance, according to new subjects came up on the agenda would be even after the next Ministerial. New subjects might arise, and developing countries would need extra training. This had not been included in the three-year plan. He supported the US point that ad hoc assistance should be specific and not general. Technical assistance for each country within the TPR process should not be optional but obligatory, having long-term benefits for trade policy formulation. Assistance should be given agreement by agreement, there was no longer any need for general seminars but specific workshops tailored to needs. He again stressed the need for flexibility – for strategy and the three-year plan.","WTCOMTDM34.pdf","Guatemala, WTO, Uruguay, Guatemala, Members, US"
"3222",3222,"164","164.      The representative of Venezuela said he wished to respond to the questions raised by the Secretariat. In his view, the document on strategy was clear, it was not voluminous and it should be left like this. As to the three-year plan, it should be more specific. It should be shorter or have a good summary as suggested by previous delegations. The documents should be related because the plan should flow from the strategy. Referring to tables 2, 3 and 4, it could be seen that technical cooperation for Latin America and the Caribbean has been reduced drastically. Technical assistance should be demand-driven, and it was the beneficiaries which determined their need. The questionnaires were useful but must be found to new ways establishing disparities. For example, contacts with the focal points in the countries themselves could be strengthened. He agreed that some importance should be attached to geographical distribution as a way of establishing priorities. The priorities raised in paragraph 20 should be linked to paragraph 57 in the strategy paper. The content of paragraph 21 should have an additional sub-section. He was pleased with the discussion in paragraph 4 on the attention to the needs of developing countries. As to the organization of activities, he agreed with idea that there should be a sub-regional perspective when the needs and difficulties were similar. Joint training activities could have a positive effect in the medium and long-term. The proposal in paragraph 32 of the strategy document was positive. Evaluation should be given priority because it would improve assistance in the future. He proposed the creation of a permanent coordination mechanism to guarantee the follow-up and evaluation of the impact in the short-term as well as ensuring continuity and the achievement of the objectives of the technical assistance programme in the medium and long-term. Finally, as to the financing of technical assistance, he hoped that regular budget would be increased, and he expressed his concern that there are continued to be conditions attached to extra-budgetary contributions.","WTCOMTDM34.pdf","Venezuela, Secretariat, Latin, America, Caribbean"

Norway was ready to consider a reform of the strategy, maybe focussing on the agreements. In order to use the strategy, there was also a need for coherence within the organization, and he understood that this was being worked on. He looked forward to seeing how the strategy could be further developed, and looked forward to hearing more about this before the summer break. The three-year plan document was very big, so it was important that there be at least a short summary. There seemed to be some lack of coherence, with a different format for the section of LDCs. This should be worked on to have one coherent document. Lastly, on resources, the WTO needed to have credible TA on budget and Norway was WT/COMTD/M/34 Page 32 ready to work with others to find ways to ensure stable and predictable resource base for technical assistance.","WTCOMTDM34.pdf","Norway, Norway, WTO, Norway"
"3220",3220,"162","162.    The representative of Switzerland said that it was necessary to improve the long-term effectiveness of technical assistance and to do so, there was a need for a coherent and comprehensive package of technical assistance in the WTO. Even if there is any agreement based approach, it will be necessary to set priorities, as demands would likely be behind what was on offer. It was necessary to reflect on how synergy could be produced between missions to the same country on different agreements. To reach the objectives, there was a need to proceed on two tracks: on the one hand, the WTO needed to develop and define a package, taking into consideration its limited means, both financially and in terms of human resources. That was why the discussion on technical assistance strategy belonged in CTD. On the other hand, beneficiary countries would need to analyze their needs in the medium-term perspective. There should be an interactive process between supply and demand, perhaps through the three-year plan. It may not be the only tool nor even the optimal one, but it was not for the delegates to tell which type of tools should be used. However, he insisted that the more general objective of the strategy include a longer-term prospective on technical assistance. Synergies must be sought, there must be follow-up activities, and the beneficiary countries must have concrete ideas in which areas and by which means they wanted to improve that capacities. The strategy should be an interactive process oriented to a longer prospective and against ad hocism. As long as these lines are followed, Switzerland was not opposed to the Secretariat changing or shortening and improving the strategy.","WTCOMTDM34.pdf","Switzerland, WTO, WTO, Switzerland, Secretariat"
"3219",3219,"161","161.     The representative of United States said that she was not in a position to accept the strategy paper that day. The Strategy needed to be more precise, more targeted. The US would look at the objectives from the demand-driven approach and the overall needs of the institution to enable developing countries to participate more effectively in the WTO. She appreciated that the three-year plan actually had divided some sections by the type of technical assistance. The US understood the WTO was not a development institution providing supply-side technical assistance, but in some cases there could be on overlap, including joint projects with other organizations such as WIPO, UNCTAD and ITC and, perhaps, ITU. She asked whether the three-year plan was mainly based on predictions from questionnaires or did it include earlier ad hoc requests? In other words, were ad hoc requests make in previous years carried over into the three-year plan? Also, what was the percentage of ad hoc requests and those requests that made in the questionnaires? How was the choice made between these competing requests? What were the priorities between regions for the use of funding? She also wanted to have a clearer idea of the percentage of technical assistance that came from the regular budget and the percentage from extra-budgetary contributions. Did any of the projections include the possibility of requests arising from ongoing negotiations? These could be anticipated, but the WTO might not have had yet specific requests, and certainly a barrage of requests could be expected when the negotiations were closer. She was also concerned about the Deputy-Director General's comments. The US was doing its best to limit the amount of conditions attached to its voluntary contributions. The US had announced recently that it would be contributing a US$1 million to the WTO Global Trust Fund, and was in the process of dealing with the mechanics for that. The intention is to do the least amount of ear-marking in that context, although it would of course have to take into account countries with which it had diplomatic relations. In the previous year, US$655,000 had been destined for the Africa region, but for the US$1 million that had recently been announced, it was hoped to limit the amount of ear-marking.","WTCOMTDM34.pdf","United, States, US, WTO, US, WTO, WIPO, UNCTAD, ITC, ITU, WTO, US, US, WTO, Global, Trust, Fund, Africa"
"3218",3218,"160","160.     The representative of the European Commission said that this was an important item, not only because the European tax payer was funding most of the technical assistance, but because it was important to get it right in order to have the credibility of the WTO assured. He appreciated the amount of work which had gone into the compilation of the reports, the three-year plan and the Strategy paper. In the six months since the paper had last been discussed, the world certainly had moved on. The idea of mainstreaming trade into overall development strategies was now firmly anchored, not only in the WTO but also in organizations like the World Bank, IMF, etc., and that should be reflected. It followed that there was a greater need for coherence on donors and organizations, which should also be reflected. Lastly, with the experience from Uruguay Round implementation, there was a clear and renewed focus on the individual agreements, as mentioned by the DDG. For the EC, the strategy was the way the priorities were established and resources allocated. The three-year plan should flow from the strategy and not the other way round. To do that, the commitment to mainstreaming had to be fully reflected in the paper. Paragraph 45 of the strategy paper said: ""In this connection, the strategy incorporates a better use of existing donor coordination mechanisms such as the World Bank Consultative Group Meetings and UNDP Round Table Meetings"". On the other hand, this was not reflected in the questionnaire. For example, countries were not asked how the proposed activity fitted with the PRSP. There were also other parts of the paper where the overall mainstreaming idea could be included. He also considered that what was going on in the WTO, in particular the renewed focus on agreements which comes from implementation experience, should also be better reflected. There should also be a clearer commitment, not just about agreements but within the various Divisions on technical assistance. For example, in the three-year plan there is a short section on page 177 on the LDCs integrated framework. This could not just be only an Annex; it had to be a part of the strategy and fully endorsed by the relevant Division. I would be useful start if all the Divisions that delivered technical assistance were represented in meetings such as this. The EC had taken note of the observations made by Mr. Ravier that the Secretariat was working on this, and was certainly interested to see how the internal re-organization reflected the strategy. On a very specific point, there was a reference on page 5 of the three-year plan, a reference to ear-marking and the constraints on flexibility. The EC would try to take that into account. The question was now what to do next. The description here was of work in progress, something to be revised. Hopefully, the paper could be updated taking into account the points made. A revised paper could be shorter, really a policy paper, not setting out too much detail, the EC hoped that this would be possible before the summer. He would also hope that the paper would have the common signature of all WTO Divisions working in this field. Finally, the EC had produced a draft paper on the agreement by agreement approach, which the EC had pursued in the customs valuation Committee and wished to expand to the SPS activity. This document would go forward as a draft decision within the next couple of days.

The representative of United States said that her delegation had appreciated the report of the JAG and would continue to support the activities of the ITC when proposals were presented in the Budget Committee. The current year would hopefully bring progress towards supplementing the resources. She said that at the Geneva side, her delegation would try to get its capital to do even more to assist the ITC because developing countries had benefitted from the very practical technical assistance provided by ITC. Her government wished to encourage the ITC because of its good results in integration developing countries into the multilateral trading system.","WTCOMTDM34.pdf","United, States, ITC, Budget, Committee, Geneva, ITC, ITC, ITC"
"3216",3216,"159","159.     The representative of Tunisia said it was important to strengthen the dialogue, as stressed by the Deputy Director-General. The three-year plan could not reflect the technical assistance needs of everyone because some could be identified in advance but others resulted from different situations at different times, especially in the framework of the follow-up of commitments on the WTO agreements. He endorsed the suggestion of Mr. Ravier to involve more Committees in identifying priority needs. The extent of voluntary contributions raised problems for the budgeting of planned activities and left less room for nanoeuvre with regard to technical cooperation, even on priority issues, although he paid tribute to the donor countries. However, the need for technical cooperation and for capacity building was growing especially relating to the implementation of their commitments on the WTO agreements, in the preparatory process for the Ministerial Conference and afterwards. He reiterated Tunisia's support for the JITAP programme.","WTCOMTDM34.pdf","Tunisia, Director-General, WTO, Ravier, WTO, Tunisia"
"3215",3215,"158","158.     The representative of Uruguay referred to the establishment of priorities in document COMTD/W/77/Rev.1. The strategy document was the result of the two-day meeting on technical assistance held in July 2000 and other internal reports of the organization. Generally, Uruguay did not have a problem at all with the priority attached to LDCs, other African countries, non-residents and small economies since these countries should receive more cooperation. But this type of priority necessarily may exclude the needs of other developing countries. For example, if we read the document relating to activities in 2000, in the annex which refers to Latin American and Caribbean countries, it is impressive to see the number of courses and seminars, workshops which worked out in the region - in other words, demand was great. All developing countries were continuing to make requests to the WTO Secretariat for technical cooperation activities, so, the establishment of priorities by country did not necessarily reflect the current reality. As the Peruvian Ambassador had said, the new negotiations in agriculture and services and electronic commerce required training, especially the Latin America region. He therefore asked how the Secretariat WT/COMTD/M/34 Page 30 established these priorities. At the Secretariat established these priorities. At the reflections on technical assistance, he did not remember there having been a list or establishment of Latin America priorities by country.","WTCOMTDM34.pdf","Uruguay, Uruguay, Caribbean, WTO, Secretariat, Ambassador, Latin, America, Secretariat, Secretariat, Latin, America"
"3214",3214,"157","157.     The representative of Peru referred to the document on strategies for technical assistance in the WTO. The document had been subject to discussions several times in the Committee in its formal and informal meetings and was a valiant effort. He could see that there had been a great effort to seek new modalities to allow for better programming and planning of technical cooperation. However, these modalities represented a considerable reduction of flexibility on the part of the Secretariat to respond to the real needs for technical assistance which could not be included in a strategy, because the truth was that a strategy which was not flexible was not a strategy; whether military, diplomatic or corporate. On financial and budgetary constraints, Peru supported efforts to include technical cooperation in the regular budget but this was a long-term objective to be realistic. Voluntary contributions would be vital if there was to be flexible technical cooperation, but the problem with these resources was that they had certain conditions attached to them, as in the IMF and World Bank loans. Technical cooperation needed to be sufficiently flexible to address new issues such as the highly technical - the new proposals to reduce quotas in agriculture, e-commerce, the categorization of services, or adapting laws on intellectual property. The programming should be sufficiently flexible to deal with the needs and requests that are presenting themselves constantly over the year.","WTCOMTDM34.pdf","Peru, WTO, Committee, Secretariat, Peru, IMF, World, Bank"
"3213",3213,"156","156.    Third was the question of resources. The first thing to bear in mind was that human resources were just as important, even more so than financial resources. If the WTO had US$20 million to spend on technical cooperation, it would not have the human resources to carry out the work. As concerns financial resources, the relationship between voluntary contributions and the regular budget funds was quite out of proportion, because the budgetary means accorded for less than 20 per cent of voluntary contributions. This was in the hands of the Members, but everybody knew this led to management problems because voluntary contributions were always accompanied by conditions, reducing flexibility and the possibilities for the Secretariat to have flexibility in the management of technical cooperation activities. Since the voluntary contributions were far higher than ordinary budget contributions, there was a problem of increasing conditionality. This is legitimate from the donor's point of view, but made management ever more difficult. Another issue for reflection was the problem of coordination among those making voluntary contributions. He was not suggesting a further Committee but the issue would be present even more in the future.","WTCOMTDM34.pdf","WTO, Members, Secretariat, Committee"
"3212",3212,"155","155.      Concerning the strategy paper, he had three series of comments in this connection. First, technical assistance was demand-driven. However, financially, it was impossible to satisfy all requests. This meant it was necessary to set up priorities. These priorities had to be set by the beneficiary countries – a principle which must be respected. The way in which priorities were determined on the basis of a common joint agreement was by means of a questionnaire sent to Member countries to ask them to place in order their priorities concerning technical cooperation. So far, the rate of reply to these questionnaires was about 54 per cent and he thought this approach should be continued. It was important for this questionnaire to be completed carefully on the basis of a dialogue between the delegations in Geneva and the administrations in the capitals. Also, it was important for someone in capitals to select the different priorities for technical cooperation, so this questionnaire was a good means, but not the only one to determine these priorities; another approach was in the framework of the Integrated Programme; and also another way could be the use of the trade policy reviews to include consultations on matters concerning technical cooperation with the                                                                                    WT/COMTD/M/34                                                                                           Page 29 country under review. There was a whole series of means to draw up, on the basis of a common agreement, the indispensable priorities for a good management of request for technical cooperation, but nothing would ever replace the permanent dialogue between the requesting countries and the Secretariat. Second was the question of how to balance the management on a geographical basis with a more horizontal approach, based on the WTO agreements. Technical cooperation has moved progressively from general explanations of the multilateral trading system to a much more technical approach on the details of each and every agreements. So there may be some logic in starting the implementation of the technical cooperation activities with the Techncial Cooperation Division and then passing on to other Divisions dealing with one or other agreements.","WTCOMTDM34.pdf","Member, Geneva, Integrated, Programme, Secretariat, WTO, Techncial, Cooperation, Division"
"3211",3211,"154","154.     Turning to the subject of the meeting, he referred to the document on strategy which had been under discussion since the previous October. This had not been worked up and he believed that it would not be finalized. He asked whether it was necessary to search for a shorter document, such as the 1996 version. Instead of searching for a difficult consensus on a long detailed document, he asked whether it would not be better to go for something more flexible, shorter, with more general ideas about objectives, certain ways of handle things, the methods, the management, the human resources as well as financial resources. As concerned the three-year plan, the document reflected the activities which were planned but it did not reflect those which were not planned and which represented a very important part of the activities. Besides, it was well known that the degree of implementation of the three-year plan was low. Was it therefore necessary to continue with the constant up-dating of the document? He sided with the opinion that it was useful and necessary to have as a complement to the strategy document another which could be called a plan for two, three years or x-years which would be more precise on the activities of the organization in the area of technical cooperation. It might therefore be useful to ask whether it was necessary to have an elaborate strategy document with the three-year plan which was also very developed or was it possible, because these two were complementary, to have a document on strategy which would be much shorter, more general and which could be associated to the three-year plan which would still be rather detailed or the contrary. Alternatively, if a relatively developed and elaborate strategy document were desired, then could not the three-year plan be much more simple?","WTCOMTDM34.pdf",""
"3210",3210,"153","153.     The Deputy Director-General responsible for technical assistance (Mr. P.-H. Ravier) introduced the discussion with two preliminary comments. First he introduced Mr. Paul Rolian, who since February 2001 was in charge of the Audit of the Technical Assistance. It was very important to have this auditing of technical cooperation work done properly, both for the beneficiaries as well as the donor countries. Second, the Senior Management of the WTO, and specifically the Director- General was conscious of the remarks emanating from Members about the necessity to put some order in the internal organization of the Secretariat as far as Technical Assistance was concerned. Solutions were currently under consideration by the Director-General, and if and when decisions were to be taken, Members would be duly informed.","WTCOMTDM34.pdf","Director-General, Ravier, Paul, Rolian, WTO, Director, Members, Secretariat, Director-General, Members"

The documents for the items were: (i) Report on Technical Assistance Activities in 2000 (WT/COMTD/W/83); (ii) the Three-Year Plan for Technical Assistance (WT/COMTD/W/84) – a follow-up to the initial documents covering the years 2001-2003 circulated last October and November under WT/COMTD/W/79 and 79/Rev.1; and (iii) the Strategy for Technical Assistance in WTO, which had already been discussed on several occasions by the CTD.

The representative of Pakistan wanted to emphasize the importance of technical assistance and training activities for developing countries and the LDCs, and understood the constraints which the Training Division faced in terms of capacity. The important element in the whole training programme was to ensure that the participants utilised the training available, that they at least left the WTO with some understanding of the WTO agreements, which in three months or twelve weeks was practically impossible. The underlying emphasis should be always on quality and not just increasing the number of participants. In 1998, in a formal meeting of the CTD, Pakistan had suggested that if a team of four or five experts or WTO officials were sent to capitals, they could reach a much greater audience. This suggestion had largely been welcomed by the Membership. The then Chairman, Amb. Chowdhury, had acknowledged that that could be a cost-effective way to overcome the capacity constraints.","WTCOMTDM34.pdf","Pakistan, Training, Division, WTO, WTO, CTD, Pakistan, WTO, Chairman, Amb, Chowdhury"

Forty per cent of the activities of the ITC were dedicated to the LDCs. The Executive Director of the ITC had worked hard to integrate LDCs into the world economy.

"3205",3205,"149","149.    The Director, Training Division, said that a number of points had been made about diplomas and the academic recognition of the training. Another question which was mentioned by nearly everyone concerned the study tours and the related question of the additional fellowships. There were also questions on the frequency of courses and the sequence of languages in the delivery of training courses and other references to different more specific subjects. On the question of diplomas and the recognition, he welcomed all the comments, some of which had been very helpful. For the time being, this was at the beginning of the exploration of the idea. It was important to recall that the first objective was not really to provide a graduate training, but to provide for increasing the institutional capacities in the developing countries for integrating in the multilateral trading system and understanding better the multilateral trading system. It was almost by accident that the current size of the course compared with a large part of the curriculum of some universities, not a deliberate choice. The WTO would explore the possibilities for getting academic recognition and how much could be done for those which had taken the course earlier. However, there would be difficulties in the sense                                                                                      WT/COMTD/M/34                                                                                             Page 27 that it was one thing to give lectures and another thing to have them recognized by universities, as mentioned by Venezuela. For example, it might be necessary to introduce new elements in the courses, such as examinations. This had been done once in the early eighties, and it had led to such a negative outcome that he certainly did not want to go in the same direction. But the self-evaluation questionnaires might be acceptable to universities instead of formal examinations, as might the recognition of written research papers. On study tours, he was aware of the benefits: it was one way to interact with the officials of other countries, and, in this case, industrialized countries. Western Europe and Canada had contributed to these activities. However, with the blessing of the Director-General and senior management, the WTO had opted, at least for the time being, for the suppression of the European and Canadian study tours. This allowed for providing seven additional fellowships at about CHF 20,000 each, not a negligible amount. The course was also shorter: it used to be four months and now only three months which meant that it was barely possible to fit all the programme in that time even without the study tour. It was important to note that one study tour for two days study in Switzerland was being retained, plus another break, so that allowed for three tour days all together during the course which was very demanding, intellectually and physically. The programmes also allowed at least one half-day free for the participants each week, so they could do other reading or visit experts in the WTO. So the minimum had been kept in the study tour area. The WTO would consider the need for a longer tour, but if training capacity were doubled it would be difficult to keep asking the same developed-countries' authorities to organize tours for such a large number of groups. If there were six courses a year instead of three, it would mean going to six different capitals and then, the following year starting again. Regarding the sequence of languages, the current sequence corresponded to the demand since the WTO had been in existence. A greater frequency of Spanish courses or French courses would necessarily affect the capacity to meet the demand for the English courses. English, unfortunately or fortunately, was the language of the WTO in the informal sense, and everybody wanted to learn the terminology in English, wanted to be trained in English. All told there were 153 customers to satisfy every two years. Some 162 fellowships were paid from the regular budget including the 14 which come from the suppression of study tours. With more rooms, more budget and more staff, one course per year could be done. He said that he would look into the demand from India for lists of various sources of information. He thanked those who supported the increase and who had expressed their appreciation for the training courses. Delegates would have ample opportunities to repeat their support in the appropriate fora.","WTCOMTDM34.pdf","Director, Training, Division, WTO, Venezuela, Western, Europe, Canada, Director-General, WTO, Switzerland, WTO, WTO, WTO, WTO, India"

Once every two years was insufficient, especially as in addition to diplomatic civil servants from the foreign trade ministry, there were requests from civil servants in other ministries who were involved in WTO affairs, such as the Ministry of Agriculture, Industry and others dealing with WTO topics. As to what was raised by Indonesia on attending courses in Spanish, it was practically impossible for Latin American officials to participate in the courses given in English or, especially in French, which was why there were courses in Spanish. He understood that others could benefit from courses given in Spanish but Latin American officials could not always participate in the French courses, especially if they did not come from the foreign trade ministry. They could only participate in the Spanish courses or perhaps in the English courses.","WTCOMTDM34.pdf","Argentina, Secretariat, WTO, Guatemala, WTO, Ministry, of, Agriculture, ,, Industry, WTO, Indonesia"

These courses had been of considerable importance, since they had contributed to the training of young civil servants in a number of trade policy instruments, allowing for better participation in the deliberations in the WTO, as well as making decisions on trade policy at home. She was concerned that the courses did not offer the possibility for more systematic participation of her country. Cuba would like that participation in courses be over a shorter period, allowing for one participant per year. Thus civil servants in capitals would gain experience, and this would have a multiplier effect on domestic decisions as well as allowing for the increased participation of the Cuban delegation in the different deliberations, especially at such an important time as the preparation for a new Ministerial Conference. Consequently, Cuba would like to insist on the need for the participation of one candidate per year in the trade policy courses.","WTCOMTDM34.pdf","Cuba, Secretariat, Cuba, GATT, WTO, WTO, Cuba, Cuba"

The representative of India joined other delegations in thanking the Director of the Training Division for his exhaustive and complete report on training activities and on the basic document for internal use in the Secretariat. The trade policy courses were an important tool for widening the knowledge of the Members' governments on WTO activities. He joined other comments on the usefulness of the study tours. He thought it would help former participants in the Trade Policy Courses by circulating the CD-ROM being brought out by the WTO Secretariat from time-to-time. This would be helpful in updating their knowledge. It was also possible to see from the participants the areas of the interests and send them to the e-mail address. Also, in view of limitations in financial resources, it would be useful to pursue the use of distance learning. The Training Division could also issue information for all Members, including a complete listing of trade websites of various international intergovernmental organizations, as well as sources of trade statistics. He was aware that the WTO website had linkages to other websites but the listing was not complete.","WTCOMTDM34.pdf","India, Director, Secretariat, Members, WTO, WTO, Secretariat, Members, WTO"

Her government had always found the trade policy courses to be an excellent tool in helping developing countries participate in the WTO and in the multilateral trading system. She had also benefitted from                                                                                     WT/COMTD/M/34                                                                                            Page 25 the course. The course delivery was of a very high standard and professional quality. There was an initiative to reformulate some of the objectives of the course and she looked forward to having an even better crafted course for future participants. She endorsed concerns expressed by Mexico, Pakistan and Venezuela about the contraction of aspects of the trade policy course. She was also concerned that the pool of the beneficiary countries for a certain number of fellowships had been extended by merging developing countries and economies in transition, which meant therefore that each of those groups would have perhaps a less frequent turn at the tables. She also thought that the initiative on the Alumni Association was a very positive one, encouraging continuing interaction between past participants.","WTCOMTDM34.pdf","Barbados, WTO, Mexico, Pakistan, Venezuela, Alumni, Association"

He believed it was necessary to envisage a doubling of the training capacity. The programme reinforced the capacity of the developing countries to follow up on the implementation of commitments. Each country should be able to have at least one official benefitting from the training programme each year.","WTCOMTDM34.pdf","Tunisia, Director"
"3191",3191,"136","136.    The representative of Mexico supported the comments by Pakistan and Venezuela. He had also benefitted from the Trade Policy Courses, which provided a practical training for civil servants from capitals. When he came in 1991 there were two tours: one abroad and one in Switzerland. He believed it would be wrong to eliminate these tours, which allowed interaction among participants and with business representatives. The cancellation of the study tours should be reconsidered.","WTCOMTDM34.pdf","Mexico, Pakistan, Venezuela, Switzerland"
"3190",3190,"135","135.     The representative of Venezuela also thanked the Secretariat for the document. She said that training was a priority for his country and region. There were even more requests and one should take this fact into consideration. She also thought that it was an excellent idea to bring this course up to university level. To this end, it would be necessary to have an evaluation process and to give marks, a condition in most universities, and he understood that the participants were evaluated on a constant basis. Written work might also qualify for credits.","WTCOMTDM34.pdf","Venezuela, Secretariat"

Noting the proposal to have the course accredited at a university, he asked if this could be done for past participants. He expressed disappointment that the study tours had been suppressed to create seven additional fellowships. He had personally found the tour valuable. He asked whether the decision had already been taken or whether it was still being examined.","WTCOMTDM34.pdf","Pakistan, Director, TPC"
"3188",3188,"133","133.    The Director, Training Division, said that 82 officials from 72 countries/customs territories had followed the courses in 2000. In 2000, there was an English/Spanish/English sequence of courses. If the ongoing French 17th TPC were included, 78 per cent of the coverage of the cycle 2000-2001 would have been reached. Out of the 153 countries/customs territories invited to the courses, 120 had been covered thus far. There were still 33 countries/customs territories to cover. All LDCs would have participated in at least one TPC by the end of this year. A new cycle would start in January 2002 and extend through 2003, unless changes occurred in the total number of fellowships available, for example, through the implementation of the doubling proposal put forward by the Director-General. He thanked the Canadian, Spanish, Finnish and Swiss authorities equally for the study tours they had hosted in the year 2000, as well as Switzerland for the financing of one consultant on trade negotiations techniques. As mentioned in the report, efforts were continuing to improve the practical aspects and the overall operation of the courses. He was looking forward to possible cooperation with other consultants and other financing sources as well for briefings on aspects of trade negotiations, techniques and training. He mentioned that the study tours abroad had been deleted from the programme as of January 2001, and in this way it would be possible to finance seven additional fellowships in the year. More time was needed to assess the real impact of the absence of study tours abroad since the course was so intensive that the participants needed some kind of a break, even when it is a break related to WTO matters. He said that the WTO had also been talking with some Universities, and it seemed that the programme of the three months was so intensive that it was almost equivalent to 50 per cent of a Masters' degree for which the participants so far did not have any formal recognition as credit for their studies. It might be possible to negotiate something with the universities to provide proper credit to those who participated in the course. He also referred to the proposal on the doubling of capacity of the training activities, as put forward by the Director-General last year, but nothing had been agreed by the Members in terms of additional financial contributions. The Director-General would be proposing this same capacity doubling again this year. Such doubling would require initial one-time expenditures on physical installations (conference rooms, equipment and so on) and perhaps voluntary contributions to facilitate the expansion. He also informed the CTD that the Association of Former Participants of GATT/WTO Trade Policy Courses had been reactivated in February 2001, and about 70 former participants who were in Geneva had been invited. This number had grown to 75, excluding four Secretariat members WT/COMTD/M/34 Page 24 who were also former participants. There would be a meeting of the Association with the Director-General on 18 June. The Association was also looking forward to organizing a gathering of former participants at the beginning of the Doha Conference which would be attended by a large number of ex-participants in the GATT/WTO courses. The WTO was continuing to build up the electronic database of the former participants of the courses, but was still lacking about one-third of the replies from countries which participated in the past. The basic document to which the Chairman referred was being provided for information only in the interests of transparency, not for action by Members. It was for the information of Members about the efforts undertaken to put into practice recommendations arising from former participants in the courses, the WTO's own observations on the organization and delivery of the residential trade policy courses, as well as from WTO Members themselves in this Committee in particular. He noted that the Training Division was now undertaking an ever-more systematic assessment/evaluation of its activities, and was quite encouraged by the results. The Basic Document also established guidelines for the organization and delivery for the WTO's residential Trade Policy Courses, based on the feedback from participants, Members and the Secretariat. The guidelines identified the objectives to be met for the two-year cycle of courses, for individual courses, for modules and for sessions inside the modules. Thirteen objectives had been identified, ranging from the mandate of the Training Division itself, to the coverage of WTO aspects, transfer of knowledge and skills, effective organization, clarity, objectivity, practicability and the inclusion of a ""development dimension"" in the training. The evaluation tools consisted essentially of weekly evaluation questionnaires covering all sessions, plus a final questionnaire for the whole programme, and, finally, an interactive final evaluation session. From 2002, there would be self- evaluation questionnaires for all the topics. This additional tool would allow each participant to see for himself or herself how much had been learned. For the training officials, it would allow them to better focus the review sessions.","WTCOMTDM34.pdf","Director, Training, Division, Director-General, Switzerland, WTO, WTO, Universities, Director-General, Members, Director-General, CTD, Association, of, Former, Participants, of, GATT/WTO, Trade, Policy, Courses, Geneva, Secretariat, Association, Director-General, Association, GATT/WTO, WTO, Chairman, Members, Members, WTO, WTO, Members, Committee, WTO, Members, Secretariat, Training, Division, WTO"

He suggested to begin with the two documents prepared by the Training Division of the WTO Secretariat in relation to the 12-week Trade Policy Courses. The first document, WT/COMTD/W/82, was the annual report on those activities for the year 2000, while the second document, WT/COMTD/W/86, reflected the results of a review that had been undertaken by the Training Division on these Trade Policy Courses (TPC). He noted that the second document was presented under the initiative of the Secretariat to allow Members to have a better understanding of the evolution of this activity as a result of efforts to improve the practicality and effectiveness of this type of training. He invited the Director, Training Division to introduce the documents.","WTCOMTDM34.pdf","Chairman, Secretariat, WTO, WTO, Secretariat, Secretariat, Members, Director"

"3183",3183,"129","129.     The representative of Cuba presented document WT/COMTD/W/87 which supported electronic commerce without restrictions. It was based on an earlier statement on the need for unrestricted global electronic commerce, presented at the General Council on 8 May, when Members agreed to set up a work programme to study all aspects of e-commerce, taking into particular account the needs of the developing countries. In spite of the recognition that progress in international trade must be guided by rules and procedures that were compatible with Article 36 of Part IV on the GATT 1994, several developing countries including Cuba had been prevented from participating in the global project of the ITU, being conducted in cooperation with the Swiss company Wisekey, on electronic commerce for developing countries owing to the United State's policy of imposing unilateral and coercive measures in violation of the rules and principles of international trade. The ITU project was conceived to help developing countries afford access to information technology so as to guarantee secure electronic commerce (digital signatures and encryption techniques). These were in commercial use although export was forbidden for reasons of national security. She said she wished to reiterate the importance of eliminating any kind of restriction on trade for political reasons. Restrictions such as those affecting the purchase and free use of coding techniques which were already available on the market would prevent the economic development of technology in developing countries.

The representative of Indonesia said the work of the CTD had contributed positively in helping Members understand the complex issues involved in the dynamic area of electronic commerce. The discussions in the CTD had been particularly important in finding answers to the questions of how e-commerce should be treated in the WTO and in identifying the relevant WTO agreements. Despite the intensive discussion to date in the respective WTO subsidiary bodies, Indonesia considered that further work in the WTO was still required as there were questions that had not been fully answered. More work was needed on the horizontal as well as the sectoral issues. He welcomed the submission by MERCOSUR delegations. His delegation recognized the benefits that e- commerce could offer, such as minimizing transaction costs. However, like many other developing countries, the government of Indonesia also realized that the full use of the potential benefits of e-commerce posed challenges for developing countries, including telecommunications and physical infrastructure. The level of development of each developing country therefore had to be taken into respect when considering the benefits electronic commerce could bring. His delegation supported the proposals on the use of the illustrative list of issues for study, and looked forward to participating in the upcoming seminar.","WTCOMTDM34.pdf","Indonesia, CTD, Members, CTD, WTO, WTO, WTO, Indonesia, WTO, MERCOSUR, Indonesia"

The illustrative list, annexed to document W/COMTD/26 was not exhaustive, but was still useful. Electronic commerce provided opportunities for all regions, even the least-favoured sectors of the planet, and helped the development and trade of those countries as well as the enterprises working in those counties. The work carried out by the ITC could therefore be useful to the discussions in the CTD.

That effect could be enhanced to the international level with respect to small and medium-size countries and enterprises small and medium size-enterprises within developing countries. The very nature of electronic commerce was increasingly dynamic. Whatever happened to dot.com companies, the situation would stabilize and there would be another stage of electronic commerce which would hopefully be more inclusive. As far as the WTO was concerned, the development dimension concerned more WTO bodies than the CTD. Her delegation thanked MERCOSUR delegations for their contribution, and looked forward to the presentation that would come at the June seminar. Latin America had been moving fast in this area, and the US wished to see what was happening in other regions of the world. Earlier seminars with representatives from Africa and India had shown how electronic commerce worked for them at different levels. The CTD had already identified issues that were specific to the WTO Agreements and her delegation looked forward to more in depth discussion in the CTD. At the same time, some case studies could be identified in the CTD exercise to show how trade could be enhanced at the same time. The government of the United States was working to further capacity building; it had identified ten countries and was planning to augment that pilot scheme to include more countries in all regions, including transition economies. It also had the new initiative which was specific to Africa, and was implementing joint projects with other institutions such as the ITU. Her delegation hoped that the work of other institutions would be reflected at the June seminar, in particular the work of the ITU. Her delegation looked forward to more synergy on e-commerce and development between the WTO and other institutions in Geneva such as WIPO, ITC, ITU and UNCTAD.","WTCOMTDM34.pdf","United, States, U.S., WTO, WTO, CTD, MERCOSUR, Latin, America, US, Africa, India, CTD, WTO, CTD, United, States, Africa, ITU, ITU, WTO, Geneva, WIPO, ITC, ITU, UNCTAD"

Her delegation recognized the usefulness of the paper submitted to the General Council by MERCOSUR listing various issues for examination by the CTD. There was much in common with issues which the delegation of the EC also had raised in the General Council. It was important to learn about the participation of developing country enterprises in electronic commerce. The seminar held the previous year with ITC assistance had given a number of useful examples of different businesses involved in electronic commerce. It could be useful to analyse the elements which had helped them become successful and see how these might be replicated by individual Members or industries at a national level. Information technology was important in that respect, as was the question of how to facilitate the various elements which made up the electronic commerce environment. Her delegation looked forward to the seminar in June, and would be ready to share its own experience in the area, particularly the initiative called ""E-Europe"" which might be of assistance to other Members as well. The issue of technical assistance was obviously important. The EC had been assisting a number of countries and would try to prepare something in written form to the Committee on its efforts. It would also welcome hearing about the experiences developing countries had with technical assistance, in particular what had proved particularly useful or less useful as that could help to guide future assistance. Human resource development was interesting, and could to some extent be carried out through technical assistance or even education, as mentioned by Venezuela. So, there were a variety of issues which could usefully be addressed in the Committee. It could be helpful if Members were to consider submitting even brief papers to help focus the debate on the development aspects of e-commerce.","WTCOMTDM34.pdf","European, Communities, General, Council, General, Council, MERCOSUR, CTD, EC, General, Council, ITC, Members, Members, EC, Committee, Venezuela, Committee, Members"

The representative of Venezuela said that his country was interested in e-commerce and had carried out a number of activities and programmes in order to bridge the digital divide. One programme created specialized centres for the population to get access to internet services. That programme was called ""Info-Centres"". Venezuela had approved a law on electronic commerce as well as a law on telecommunication which highlighted the importance his government attached to the issue. There was also a draft law on technology. His government considered electronic commerce for development a priority and therefore supported points 7, 9 and 12 of section E of the annex to document W/COMTD/26 which was the illustrative list of points for which further study had been proposed i.e., development of infrastructure, technical assistance in order to bridge the digital divide and technology transfer, perfecting human resources, and how companies in developing countries could compete using electronic commerce. He proposed that the CTD evaluate the impact of e-commerce on development, emphasizing options available to bridge the digital divide. It was necessary to consider technology transfer and giving priority to better access. He reiterated what had been said by the representative of Venezuela in the General Council on behalf of the delegations of Chile, Costa Rica, Columbia, Equator and Peru during the discussion of the work programme on electronic commerce, namely that that group sought continued study of electronic commerce by the different subsidiary bodies. The group hoped to study positive national experiences, the impact on opportunities in investment and the implications for education, public health, development and small and medium-enterprises, etc. and emphasised the importance of the work in the WTO along with other organizations, as well as the need for technical assistance to help developing countries bridge the digital divide.","WTCOMTDM34.pdf","Venezuela, Venezuela, CTD, Venezuela, General, Council, Chile, Costa, Rica, Columbia, Equator, Peru, WTO"
"3169",3169,"116","116.     The representative of Uruguay wished to recall in the CTD the statement that MERCOSUR had made with regard to e-commerce in the General Council of 8 May. MERCOSUR delegations had presented a document (WT/GC/W/434) which stated that MERCOSUR had participated and would continue to participate actively in the WTO Work Programme on Electronic Commerce. The document intended to contribute to the work programme and foster a debate between Members. MERCOSUR delegations hoped to contribute to the development of a methodology, which would enable Members to reinvigorate the work programme, looking both at sectorial issues which were under study in the different subsidiary bodies, and, at horizontal or cross-cutting issues. MERCOSUR delegations had identified three sectorial issues which they wished to highlight in the CTD. The first was the need to perfect human resources in e-commerce; the second was infrastructure; and the third was how businesses could compete in e-commerce in developing countries. There were also three cross-cutting issues: the classification of the content of some electronic transmissions; the relationship between traditional means of trade and e-commerce; and questions related to WT/COMTD/M/34 Page 20 development, including among others technical assistance. The identification of these issues in the MERCOSUR document did not prejudge the conclusion which might come out of an analysis carried out by the Members. Rather, the document aimed at highlighting the close relationship between the different issues. As MERCOSUR delegations had stated in the General Council, special attention should be given to development aspects, as development was a horizontal cross-cutting issue in the work programme.","WTCOMTDM34.pdf","Uruguay, CTD, MERCOSUR, General, Council, MERCOSUR, MERCOSUR, WTO, Work, Programme, Members, MERCOSUR, Members, MERCOSUR, CTD, MERCOSUR, Members, MERCOSUR, General, Council"

The Chairman said that, following the substantial discussion on electronic commerce in the General Council on 8 May 2001, the four subsidiary bodies which also dealt with the issue of electronic commerce had been invited to continue their work and report back to the General Council. The Committee on Trade and Development was one of these subsidiary bodies. He understood that Members attached importance to the issue of electronic commerce and development, and he sought Members views on how to deal with the issue of electronic commerce in the Committee on Trade and Development. An illustrative list of points for which further study was proposed in the CTD had been circulated on 1 November 2000 as an Annex to document WT/COMTD/26. That list contained a large range of issues identified for possible future work in the Committee on Trade and Development. In order for any in-depth work to be carried out in the CTD, it would be necessary to identify specific aspects which Members considered to be of priority importance. Once the Committee had narrowed the list of issues, it would also have to decide on how to deal with them. In addition to the illustrative list, aspects to electronic commerce and development had been mentioned during the General Council meeting of 8 May 2001 when several delegations identified a range of development issues as being horizontal in nature. The issues identified at the General Council included: participation of developing countries in e-commerce; technical assistance; capacity-building; access to infrastructure and technology; promoting the use of information technology; transfer of technology; access to developed countries' markets for developing countries' producers and suppliers; and how to ensure that e-commerce benefits developed and developing countries equally. The Chairman reminded delegations that the 2001 Work Programme for the Committee on Trade and Development already contained a seminar on electronic commerce. The date for this seminar had been set for 14 June, just before the mid-June General Council discussion dedicated to horizontal issues of electronic commerce. The theme of the CTD seminar would be ""Government Facilitation of E-commerce for Development"". Four sessions were envisaged on: Regulation and Deregulation; Promotion of Modern Information and Communication Technologies; Education and Information;                         and Government Coordination/Task-force on Electronic Commerce. The idea was to have a lead speaker from a developing country government for each session, with a respondent from a developed country government and possibly representatives of other international organizations and the private sector. These speakers would share their experiences, and there would be time for discussion.","WTCOMTDM34.pdf","Chairman, General, Council, General, Council, Committee, on, Trade, and, Development, Members, Members, Committee, on, Trade, and, Development, CTD, Committee, on, Trade, and, Development, CTD, Members, Committee, General, Council, General, Council, Chairman, Committee, on, Trade, and, Development, General, Council, CTD, Promotion, of, Modern, Information, and, Communication, Technologies, Electronic, Commerce"

However, that did not cover exactly the same perspective. What had been seen so far unfortunately was that the changes in trade flows would be rather small. His government's interpretation was that market access for LDCs was important, but that other conditions had to be met as well.","WTCOMTDM34.pdf","Norway, LDCs"

On the other hand, the EC agreed that all concerns had to be adequately addressed, including the possible question of the impact of GSP schemes. He therefore asked the representative of Sri Lanka to put her points on paper. He could already signal that his delegation had a slight problem with the fact that the proposal seemed to be all about the possible impact on other developing countries and not about why GSP was granted in the first place, namely to give preferences to developing countries, which was an accepted part of the WTO system. It was therefore necessary to reflect on how to present anything like that in a balanced fashion. There also seemed to be some technical questions for the Secretariat. There was scope for informal discussions about what was feasible and what was acceptable to the Membership.","WTCOMTDM34.pdf","European, Communities, Sri, Lanka, EC, GSP, Sri, Lanka, GSP, WTO, Secretariat"

The representative of Sri Lanka, referring to her earlier intervention, proposed the following issues for inclusion into a WTO study of the effects of the GSP schemes on the developing countries: total GSP products coverage for LDCs and non-LDCs; the average tariff level of GSP rates for LDCs and non-LDCs; the total trade under GSP of LDCs and non-LDCs; the impact of the erosion of GSP rates on non-LDCs; the impact of new rules of origin on LDCs and non-LDCs; and, finally, the possible trade effects resulting from unilateral preferential tariff concessions on trade flows from other developing countries. Referring to some of the problems for the study, she recalled an earlier Secretariat paper on how to convert specific duties to ad valorem duties. It would be necessary to take account of tariff quotas because a lot of GSP are preferential tariff quotas. She also noted the importance of non-tariff barriers.","WTCOMTDM34.pdf","Sri, Lanka, WTO, GSP, LDCs, GSP, LDCs, GSP, GSP, Secretariat, GSP"
"3159",3159,"107","107.     The Director, Statistics Division, said that her Division had been actively supporting the Development Division in its work on GSP schemes since early April. The data elements required were as follows: MFN applied duties and preferential duties at the tariff line level; Import values by partner country at the tariff line level; and for each member implementing preferential schemes, identification of the beneficiaries. The primary source for the information required for this exercise was the WTO Integrated Data Base (IDB), built from the official submissions of WTO Members. The mandatory IDB information requirements included MFN current bound duties, MFN current applied duties, and imports by country of origin, value and quantity – all at the tariff line level. Additional information, including information on preferential duties, was not mandatory, but was submitted by some Members on a voluntary basis. The current reference years of the IDB are 1996-2001 for tariffs and 1996-1999 for imports. If all the data were available, it would have been a relatively straightforward task for the IDB statisticians and programmers to compile the required information using the standard software applications with some modifications. However, some of the information needed for this study was not contained in the IDB. For example, the preferential duties of a number of significant traders, in particular the EC were missing. In addition, the IDB information was not up-to-date for all the Members concerned. In order to overcome data availability problems, the Secretariat was looking into the possibility of complementing IDB information with data from other sources, such as the TPR Division and the UNCTAD ""TRAINS"" database. The United Nations Statistical Division's COMTRADE database could also be used for import information, although it did not go beyond the 6-digit level. However, merging IDB and non-IDB data was not, based on recent experience, the optimum solution, essentially because differences in format created additional processing burdens and were also a potential source of errors. In addition, the tariff level on which the information was reported in other sources could differ from the level at which the data were reported to the IDB. Therefore, in order to use such external data, the Secretariat could be obliged to perform some additional calculations on the files used for the analyses (averages, grouping of trade, etc.). The best solution would therefore be for the Members concerned to supply the missing information. In this respect, the EC had already been requested to investigate the possibility of supplying preferential information to the Secretariat in the context of the current Multilateral Appraisal of the IDB process being undertaken by the Committee on Market Access. The Statistics Division would be available to dialogue with delegations in this respect. Despite the limitations on data availability, the work was proceeding. The software applications needed to WT/COMTD/M/34 Page 18 perform the necessary calculations had been developed using the information of two IDB reporters (Japan and the US), and the results were being extensively verified. After testing, the IDB could then be used to perform similar calculations for Australia, Canada and New Zealand. However, for the EC, the Republic of Korea and Norway, preferential duties would need to be integrated into the working data set using non-IDB sources. These applications could only operate on duties with ad valorem rates or ad valorem equivalents; specific duties could not be used because developing the complex software needed to convert specific duties into ad valorem equivalents was beyond the resources of the Secretariat, and, in any case, not all specific duties could be converted with the existing information in the IDB. Given the current resource constraints, the demanding computer application work necessary, and the sheer volume of information that needed to be analysed and presented properly, a realistic time-frame for presentation of the results to the Committee would not be before its next meeting in October.","WTCOMTDM34.pdf","Director, Statistics, Division, GSP, MFN, WTO, Integrated, Data, Base, WTO, Members, MFN, MFN, Members, IDB, IDB, IDB, EC, IDB, Members, Secretariat, IDB, TPR, UNCTAD, United, Nations, Statistical, Division, COMTRADE, IDB, IDB, Secretariat, Members, EC, Secretariat, IDB, Committee, on, Market, Access, Japan, US, IDB, Australia, Canada, New, Zealand, EC, Republic, of, Korea, Norway, Secretariat, IDB, Committee"

The Director, Development Division recalled that at the previous CTD, in the context of the S&D debate, the representative of the United States and one or two other delegations had asked the Secretariat to include work on GSP schemes in relation to S&D. He said that GSP was a big topic and the Secretariat had work in progress but was not yet in a position to present it to the CTD. It hoped to do so at the October meeting of the CTD. The work would contain a descriptive and a quantitative part. If possible, all GSP schemes would be covered. One problem was that GSP schemes were unilateral; there were up-to-date notifications on some GSP schemes, but not necessarily all. He appealed to Members to make sure that the Secretariat had the most up-to-date information on GSP schemes to permit a good job. In the absence of statistical information, in particular, at the tariff line level, the Secretariat had been trying to use information from the Integrated Data Base.

First, there would be a single set of provisions in the WTO on the transfer of technology. Second, if the transfer of technology was a separate category, it would be possible in the S&D document to include those provisions with a column on observations, from which it would be possible to see the degree of implementation of those provisions.","WTCOMTDM34.pdf","Uruguay, Secretariat, WTO"

"3151",3151,"10","10.     The Chairperson of the JAG said that the JAG had held its 34th Session from 30 April to 4 May 2001. The report was contained in document ITC/AG(XXXIV)/188. The terms of reference of the JAG were to review the activities of the ITC and to formulate recommendations to the Governing Bodies of UNCTAD and the WTO. The Group examined the following matters during its session: ITC's technical cooperation activities in the year 2000, the draft annual report and the report of the consultative committee on the ITC Global Trust Fund. During the opening session, Mr. Rubens Ricupero, the Secretary General of UNCTAD referred to the important work undertaken by ITC on behalf of the least-developed countries. UNCTAD echoed ITC's concerns regarding the unpredictability of resources, and Mr. Ricupero noted that the rhetoric about the central importance of                                                                                    WT/COMTD/M/34                                                                                            Page 3 trade as a tool for development had not been backed by action from donor countries. Mr. Ablassé Ouedraogo, Deputy-Director General of WTO thanked ITC for its valuable contribution to the work of the WTO to establish capacities for integrating developing countries and transitional economies into the multilateral trading system. He also commended ITC's particularly impressive record in the year 2000 in building teamwork, in providing specialized support to other organizations and in joining partnerships to design and implement technical assistance. In his statement to the Group, Mr. Bélisle referred to ITC's achievements in the year 2000 which included the finalization and pilot testing of the e-facilitated trade development strategy and the design of a programme of implementation called the E-trade bridge. The programme was intended to assist small- and medium-size enterprises in bridging the digital divide. In fact, this programme was presented during an informal session of the JAG meeting where representatives had the opportunity to exchange views on the subject. During the review of ITC's technical cooperation activities in 2000, the Group commended ITC on its new annual report which was more analytical than the previous one and provided an excellent basis for discussion of ITC's technical cooperation activities. ITC's central role in trade-related technical cooperation was acknowledged and its pro-activity in trade-related capacity building unanimously endorsed. Likewise, ITC had been congratulated by many on the effective management of its limited resources. A number of donor representatives indicated interest in being more closely associated with ITC's ongoing efforts to identify ways to achieve its technical assistance objectives, and several endorsed a proposal for a comprehensive independent evaluation to ITC. Such an evaluation would be conducted as a forward-looking exercise with a view to determining ITC's larger role in trade-related technical assistance. The recommendation was welcomed by the Secretariat which suggested that further consultations be held to ensure that the exercise had clear and specific terms of reference and that it involved all stakeholders. Another subject raised was the current practice of the JAG which resulted in documentation being submitted in four languages (English, French, Russian and Spanish) while interpretation was in the six official languages. One representative requested documentation in all six languages as was customary in UN meetings, while another representative, insisting on the Joint UN-WTO nature of JAG, was not in favour of increasing administrative costs. This matter would require further consideration. Finally, at the 31st Session, government representatives had either announced or confirmed voluntary contributions to ITC and the Chairperson of the JAG expressed gratitude to the Governments of Canada, China, Denmark, Finland, France, India, the Netherlands, Norway, Sweden and Switzerland for their contributions.","WTCOMTDM34.pdf","Chairperson, JAG, ITC, UNCTAD, WTO, Group, ITC, ITC, Global, Trust, Fund, Rubens, Ricupero, UNCTAD, ITC, UNCTAD, ITC, Ricupero, Ablassé, Ouedraogo, WTO, ITC, WTO, ITC, Group, Bélisle, ITC, ITC, Group, ITC, ITC, ITC, ITC, ITC, ITC, ITC, Secretariat, UN, Joint, UN-WTO, ITC, Chairperson, Canada, China, Denmark, Finland, France, India, Netherlands, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland"

On paragraph 11, there was a proposal to delete part of the sentence that some measures were disguised restrictions on access and replace it with ""owing to the possible trade restrictive effects"". Egypt preferred the previous language as a statement of developing countries' views. The previous language only referred to some measures where as the new language said that all the measures had possible trade-restrictive effects. Egypt did not agree with the word ""possible"", because in certain cases it was evident that they did have trade-restrictive effects. So Egypt preferred the original language or to delete the word ""possible"" from the new language. Regarding the US proposed amendments to paragraph 16, there was a reference to efforts that included measures to build capacity in developing countries. These efforts were not necessarily part of the on-going process to address the issues of WT/COMTD/M/33 Page 4 implementation. Egypt had commented to that effect in a previous meeting and this had been resolved in later versions of the paper. He suggested that the final sentence should start ""Efforts are also exerted to build capacity.."" and so on, as suggested by the US. He also noted that the US wanted to suggest how to deal with certain problems, but this was a wider issue and the CTD was not the forum to deal with implementation issues. On paragraph 17, there was an attempt to take away some of the elements that were important for Egypt. It would be acceptable to include the US comments as well as the original language.","WTCOMTDM33.pdf","Egypt, Egypt, Egypt, Egypt, US, Egypt, US, US, CTD, Egypt, US"

The representative of the European Commission was not 100 per cent happy with the language because some of the straightforward messages on financing for development had been diluted and that was the inevitable price for a consensus document. On the other hand the EU was quite pleased that some of their suggestions had been taken on board. The EU was ready to adopt the paper as it stood. The new proposals were basically also acceptable, but the EU would like for political reasons to see the word ""all"" deleted from the Argentine proposal, so that the fourth sentence of paragraph 11 would read ""Members consider that…"" Other changes were acceptable. In response to Cuba, the document was balanced: it did not say that liberalization was good and all should carry it out. It did have the right parameters that there were certain other conditions, constraints and issues to take into account. He hoped the paper would be acceptable as a first step and showed that the WTO was able to deliver a message. Fine tuning could be done later. This was not necessarily the final word. It would depend how the process went on. A more in-depth contribution by the WTO might yet be possible on some individual issues. He supported efforts to conclude that day and urged other delegations to take a similar view.","WTCOMTDM33.pdf","European, Commission, EU, EU, EU, Members, Cuba, WTO, WTO"
"3142",3142,"7","7.       The representative of Cuba felt that the text did not contain the essence of the problems which most affected trade for developing countries; it simply listed the contradictions of the multilateral trading system, qualifying them as ""economic"". From a general standpoint the document listed some of the obstacles faced by developing countries in order to take advantage of the WTO and reiterated in most paragraphs that free trade policies and the system of multilateral trade standards could contribute most to economic growth and poverty alleviation in these countries. It would not be revealing any great secret to state that economic liberalization has left unfulfilled many promises and the results had not been those expected. This was shown in ECLAC Notes, in a special edition of March past, which showed that, while Latin America and the Caribbean had been particularly active in carrying out trade liberalization, the liberalization of financial markets and of capital flows, economic growth, productive transformation, increased productivity and the reduction of inequality had been disappointing. Economic growth had been insufficient and unstable. The report should also be critical of the role that developed countries could and should play in providing technical and financial assistance to developing countries. This would permit the developing countries to devote more resources to social and development programmes. On specific points, she underlined that solutions such as those mentioned in paragraph 6 on the efforts to be made by governments to create internal resources such as increasing self-sufficiency did not take account of the heterogeneity of developing countries and the diversity of problems, above all taking account of the limited access to external resources. Likewise, drawing attention the last sentence of paragraph 4 and the first of paragraph 6, she said there was no automatic relationship between trade liberalization and promoting economic growth to alleviate poverty. Thus, a book published by ECLAC called ""A decade of light and shadows in Latin America in the 1990s"", a study of 91 countries, recognised that during the first part of the decade profound disparities in world incomes were accentuated. The relation between the average income of the top 5 per cent and the bottom 5 per cent changed form 78:1 in 1988 to 114:1 in 1993. The study also stated that the influence of trade on growth decreased, and it added that the large part of the population of Latin America (83.6 per cent) lived in countries where this inequality increased between 1975 and 1995, reaching levels which were the worst in the world. It was also known that during the 1990s, economic liberalization increased in the 1990s in the least-developed countries, but the main trends in the world economy did not justify their expectations. The poorest countries, instead of converging on the growth of their developed partners, had fallen into a vicious circle of stagnation and recession , with the risk of marginalization leading to the unequal distribution of costs and benefits from the processes of globalization and liberalization. It was therefore not correct to affirm as it did in paragraph 7 that the principle of equity contributed to a favourable economic environment for development, given that in this forum there was equity among unequals, implying an injustice which maintained and increased the historical advantage of the developed countries over the least-developed countries. On paragraph 11, the document should not only recognise the concern about barriers faced by developing countries, but also the need to                                                                                      WT/COMTD/M/33                                                                                              Page 3 eliminate protectionist measures and policies as well as technical regulations and standards which under the guise of environmental or social intentions are being used as new barriers to exports of the developing countries. Thus, Cuba suggested that the document should include the dismantling of technical barriers to trade and the elimination of tariff peaks on manufactured exports of interest to the developing countries. The final sentence of the same paragraph recognised the concern of some Members about the possible negative effect of on development of some trade measures. Cuba wished to reiterate its views on the proliferation and real negative effects of unilateral economic measures in trade to pursue political objectives. The document should recognise that unilateral economic measures affect the trade and development of the developing countries, harmed the international economic and political environment and particularly affected the economies and development efforts of developing countries, especially their capacity to mobilize resources in the area of trade to finance development, as well as being incompatible with the rules of international trade. The lack of financial resources for development was one of the principal problems to be resolved through international cooperation and it was therefore necessary to reach an agreement on this. Any international cooperation on development should respect the right of governments to decide on their national development priorities and hence the specific needs for cooperation. The process of globalization of the world economy imposed a financial burden on developing countries which could not be underestimated. Integration in the world economy could not ignore this reality nor accept it with a kind of fatalism. It was necessary to reform the rules of international trade in order to address the inequalities and imbalances which existed so that trade liberalization would provide benefits to all WTO Members and positive efforts should be made so that the developing countries, especially the least-developed, could obtain that share in the growth of international trade that corresponded to their economic development needs, in line with the Marrakesh Agreement. Finally, Cuba wanted to emphasise that the WTO Members' contribution to the Conference on Financing for Development did not constitute a binding commitment and was therefore a rhetorical document that would not lead to concrete initiatives to mobilize financial resources for development.","WTCOMTDM33.pdf","Cuba, WTO, ECLAC, Latin, America, Caribbean, ECLAC, Latin, America, Latin, America, Cuba, Members, Cuba, WTO, Members, Cuba, WTO, Members, Financing, for, Development"
"3141",3141,"6","6.      The representative of the United States said that the paper had progressed well, but that two paragraphs need further work. In paragraph 16 there had been some adjustment to the language regarding the distribution of gains from the trading system. He proposed that this should read ""Since 1995 there has been a decline in the share in world trade of the least-developed countries"". That point was worth making. He recognised that some countries felt there was a maldistribution of benefits and suggested some language which preserved that thought. Something pro-active needed to be added at the end to suggest ways in which to start to deal with the issue which had been identified. In paragraph 17, he believed it would be better to state the issue in a positive way that all could agree where there was further work to be done in the WTO to ensure the widest distribution of benefits.","WTCOMTDM33.pdf","United, States, WTO"

The Secretariat had been in touch with several delegations to clarify certain points and prepared the text that was now before the CTD. Two further proposals for amendments to the text, one by Argentina and one by the United States, were available in the room. He reminded Members that the text was in the form of a political statement, and did not constitute in any way a binding legal commitment on Members.

Re the US proposal on paragraph 16, he commented that while the first part referred to the declining share of the LDCs, this stress on the LDCs was absent form the later part of the paragraph. There was also an implication that LDCs' capacity constraints were really being addressed as if the WTO work was sufficient to correct imbalances. This was not correct and there should again be a stress on LDCs.

On paragraph 17, the deleted second sentence covered the same issues as the first sentence which was why Korea had proposed its deletion.

He suggested an additional sentence based on the guidelines recently adopted in the services meeting that credit and recognition needed to be given for autonomous liberalization. He suggested that paragraph 16, read ""The Marrakesh Agreement was designed to be a major achievement…"" On paragraph 17, he did not see the need to drop the second sentence nor the later reference to the analytical stage.

In paragraph 11 referring to the ""possible"" effects of non-tariff measures on developing countries, Ecuador considered that there were definite trade-restrictive effects. In paragraph 17 Ecuador would like to hold broader consultations to find a balance in what was being stated. This was linked to what was being discussed in other WTO bodies. Retaining the original language would have facilitated adoption of the text. The references to investment and competition policy seemed to draw inferences about the content of future negotiations.

"3098",3098,"96","96.     Mr. Mercier, Director, Training Division said that he would attempt to respond to the remarks made by the representative of Switzerland which had been supported by the representative of Norway, with respect to the priorities in the WTO Secretariat training activities. What had been suggested was to give higher priority to LDCs in the training courses at the same time as maintaining the access for the other countries. Although it was a desirable proposal, it was impossible in practice. If additional fellowships were granted to a larger number of LDCs, it would mean that other developing countries                                                                                     WT/COMTD/M/32                                                                                            Page 21 and economies in transition would receive less than the one fellowship every two years that each of them were currently receiving. The fact that developing countries and economies in transition received so few fellowships had already been considered deplorable by most delegations. It was desirable that, in the future with an expanded capacity, the request could be responded to. However, in the present context, difficulties would be created for other beneficiaries if the LDCs were to receive additional preference. There was already a large representation of LDCs in each trade policy course. That even included LDCs which had not begun the accession process, which were not observers, and which therefore did not even have a WTO status. In that sense the LDCs were already treated favourably. At the moment, there were between 145-150 countries and customs territories which were regularly invited to the courses and only 144 fellowships available in any two-year cycle. Additional fellowships per year had been made available as of the current year because the study-tour in Europe had been taken out of the trade policy course in order to compensate for the lack of additional funds in last year's budget. An important activity of the trade policy course had thus been deleted from the programme in order to create more fellowships within the same budget. He took note of the remarks made and said that although he sympathized with the hope expressed, the Secretariat was not in a position to implement the suggestion on LDCs without hurting other Members in the process. That was why paragraph 21 had been inserted into the strategy paper to balance the priorities set in paragraph 20 as the same priorities as were set for the WTO technical cooperation activities in general could not be applied to the training courses.","WTCOMTDM32.pdf","Mercier, Director, Training, Division, Switzerland, Norway, WTO, Secretariat, LDCs, WTO, LDCs, Europe, Secretariat, Members, WTO"
"3097",3097,"95","95.      He went on to say that paragraph 62 and 63 on outsourcing reflected the fact that the WTO Secretariat was trying to decentralize and outsource part of its technical cooperation activities while remaining the master of the process and especially keeping control of the technical aspects of the Agreements. The Secretariat rarely received refusals, although it happened, when it informed beneficiaries that a consultant would be sent rather than a WTO Secretariat employee. With respect to what had been said by the representative of the United States on the current draft of the strategy he indicated that the word ""in-budget"" had been deleted and replaced by ""an adequate regular budget"". He had thought that that might satisfy the concern raised by the delegation of the United States. At the last meeting of the Committee on Trade and Development the representative of the United States had asked for the two paragraphs on financing be completely removed. The Secretariat thought that it was not realistic to have a strategy on technical assistance without a mention of financing, but had tried to accommodate the concern by referring to an adequate regular budget supplemented by voluntary contributions plus financing from multilateral organizations and to delete the word ""in-budget"".","WTCOMTDM32.pdf","WTO, Secretariat, Secretariat, WTO, Secretariat, United, States, United, States, Committee, on, Trade, and, Development, United, States, Secretariat"
"3096",3096,"94","94.      He continued by referring to the issue of financing mentioned by the representative of Australia who had sought information regarding what the WTO Secretariat was going to do with the budgetary increase it had received. At the last informal meeting of the Committee on Trade and Development the WTO Secretariat had received the mandate, in principle, to implement the objectives set out in the strategy. That was what the Secretariat had been doing. He intended to come back to the Committee on Trade and Development in May 2001 with a detailed programme of technical assistance based on requests received and also based on the fact that many of the voluntary contributions received were earmarked. The earmarking might not coincide exactly with the requests received. That was therefore an additional difficulty faced by the WTO Secretariat. The representative of Zambia had asked what the Secretariat did for the LDCs. The current procedure was that when the Technical Cooperation Division or the Secretariat Working Group on Least-Developed Countries and the Integrated Framework received a voluntary contribution that was ear-marked for LDCs it meant that the contribution could not be used for other developing countries or economies in transition. The approaches used in the Technical Cooperation Division and in the Secretariat Working Group on Least-Developed Countries and the Integrated Framework were similar as they basically followed the strategy. In May, delegations would be presented with the programme for Asia and the Pacific, Latin America and the Caribbean, the Middle East, Africa and the Central and Eastern European countries based on the demands resulting from the questionnaire mailed to all developing countries and economies in transition in July 2000 and to which 50 per cent had responded. Ad hoc requests would be dealt with as mentioned in the strategy. A positive aspect that comments on the strategy paper were still being received was that the revised strategy to be presented in May 2001 could then be compared with the three-year plan for 2001-2003 based on the proposed strategy. Delegations would thus be able to judge whether the strategy made sense in practice before further action is taken by the Committee.","WTCOMTDM32.pdf","Australia, WTO, Secretariat, Committee, on, Trade, and, Development, the, WTO, Secretariat, Secretariat, Committee, on, Trade, and, Development, WTO, Secretariat, Zambia, Secretariat, Secretariat, Working, Group, on, Least-Developed, Countries, Integrated, Framework, Secretariat, Working, Group, Asia, Pacific, Latin, America, Caribbean, Middle, East, Africa, Central, and, Eastern, Committee"
"3095",3095,"93","93.      Mr. Léger, Director, Technical Cooperation Division said that a number of delegations had indicated that the internal coherence in the WTO was not transparent as staff working on issues related to development worked under different Deputy-Directors General, that the issue of technical assistance was divided in four different divisions and that a Technical Cooperation Audit recently had been created with responsibility for the evaluation of technical assistance. He said that he undertook to relate delegations' preoccupations to the Director-General as the Director-General had the final word on how to organize the WTO Secretariat. In response to the comment made by the representative of Norway regarding the last sentence of paragraph 39, he said that there had been a shift over the last five years in the type of requests the WTO Secretariat received from developing countries, LDCs and economies in transition. When the WTO Secretariat was established in 1995 there had been a demand for general seminars as people then wished to learn what the WTO was all about. They had requested general descriptions of each of the Agreements, and information about Members' benefits and rights. As Members had had to implement the Agreements with fixed deadlines, Members had become more interested in in-depth seminars on specific Agreements. That was also the reason why there had been a shift within the WTO Secretariat from the Technical Cooperation Division undertaking close to 70 per cent of all technical missions at one time to the current situation where only about one third of all technical cooperation missions were being carried out by the Technical Cooperation Division and about two-thirds of the missions by other WTO divisions. The beneficiaries of technical cooperation activities requested WTO specialists to come to their countries to speak about agriculture, rules or intellectual property for example. By concentrating activities in the areas of the WTO Secretariat's comparative advantage, listed in Annex 3 of the Strategy, the WTO Secretariat was using its resources more efficiently than before. An example of that was outsourcing. It was a fact that the WTO Secretariat had signed memoranda of understanding with a number of regional organizations. ESCAP, for example, had organized a three- WT/COMTD/M/32 Page 20 week trade-policy course last year. That meant that ESCAP not only had made the physical arrangements but had also been responsible for identifying participants and making travel arrangements. In the course of 2001, the process had been taken yet a step further as ESCAP would be responsible for lecturing on macroeconomics and the general functioning of the WTO during the first two days of the two-week trade-policy course. However, there was a limit to what the WTO Secretariat could expect representatives of ESCAP to do on specific Agreements of the WTO.","WTCOMTDM32.pdf","Léger, Director, Technical, Cooperation, Division, WTO, Director-General, Director-General, WTO, Secretariat, Norway, WTO, Secretariat, WTO, Secretariat, WTO, Members, Members, Members, WTO, Secretariat, Technical, Cooperation, Division, Technical, Cooperation, Division, WTO, WTO, WTO, Secretariat, WTO, Secretariat, WTO, Secretariat, ESCAP, ESCAP, ESCAP, WTO, WTO, Secretariat, ESCAP, WTO"
"3094",3094,"92","92.      The representative of Mexico said that the strategy paper should be weighed in the light of all that had been discussed over the last two years with respect to the regular budget, consistency and coherence. It was an urgent exercise. As had been mentioned by the representative of the European Communities, the General Council had to give it direction. If comments were still made, the Secretariat could respond to some of them. Other comments could be made in relation to certain parts of the strategy document and they should first be taken up with the Member making the comment in order for the strategy to be adopted at another meeting of the Committee on Trade and Development. It was a unique document. No other organization had a strategy for technical assistance programmes and activities. In the interest of confidence building and the work ahead, the Committee on Trade and Development should be in a position to adopt the document.","WTCOMTDM32.pdf","Mexico, European, Communities, General, Council, Secretariat, Member, Committee, on, Trade, and, Development, Committee, on, Trade, and, Development"
"3093",3093,"91","91.      The representative of Turkey said that his delegation found the strategy useful for the future organization of the technical assistance activities of the WTO. He said that his delegation's concern related to the priorities set out in the strategy. His delegations supported giving high priority to the integration of the LDCs into the multilateral trading system. The plan seemed to address the requirements of LDCs, African countries, small economies and economies in transition. However, developing countries which were not in those categories needed technical assistance as well. The right of other developing countries to receive technical assistance also had to be taken into account. In addition, an assessment of the outcome of the technical assistance activities in receiving countries would be appropriate. That assessment should include the particular benefits gained by those countries with respect to their participation in the multilateral trading system. Such an approach would not only increase their level of participation in international trade but also entail a better planning of WTO technical assistance activities. He said that his delegation believed that the existing level of cooperation between regional organizations should be sustained and further improved if there was a need. The infrastructure of those organizations might be complementary to the existing expertise of the WTO Secretariat. Since countries of the same region faced similar difficulties and had similar problems, cooperation with regional organizations would be helpful in focussing on those issues of particular regional concern.","WTCOMTDM32.pdf","Turkey, WTO, LDCs, WTO, WTO, Secretariat"
"3092",3092,"90","90.      The representative of the European Communities said that his delegation liked the paper as it stood and only had a few minor comments. The main question was what the Committee on Trade and Development intended to do with the paper. An endorsement by the Committee was a minimalist option while his delegation suggested that the issue was important enough to be brought to the attention of the General Council, preferably in May 2001 in order for the General Council to confirm the orientation given in the paper in its various components including the activities undertaken in the Committees and in the Integrated Framework. Technical assistance was an important component of the confidence building efforts. The strategy paper could provide a basis for future work in that respect. His delegation also endorsed comments made by other delegations in terms of the internal coordination of the Secretariat.

"3090",3090,"89","89.      The representative of Philippines said that WTO technical assistance activities were carried out with limited funds. There were complex demands on WTO technical assistance, not only from a bifurcation of the developing countries into less-developed countries, small economies, poor and heavily indebted countries, but also from the point of view of the development objectives, which never should be forgotten in the Committee on Trade and Development and the WTO. As far as the definition of objectives was concerned, it was not only dealing with the competencies in the WTO but also with the fuller integration of countries in the multilateral trading system, looking at broader developmental requirements, capacity building and complementary support to the needs identified by the recipients, in the context of their economic situation. That framework was a challenge to any technical assistance strategy. However, his delegation did not see a problem with the setting of priorities, nor with the definition of national needs. It was also useful to consider the needs in terms of groups of countries or economies, regions or sub-regions as well as in terms of thematic approaches like e-commerce or information and communication technologies. The expectations of developing countries were being raised without any prospect of increases in the budgetary allocations, being internal or external, to technical cooperation activities. The technical assistance strategy should be one of networking and outsourcing, which for those who were in the business of technical assistance and in other agencies in Geneva, had been quite successful in spreading the benefits of technical assistance. That was especially true in the area of market opportunities when based on the context and the economic situation in different parts of the world. The experts in Geneva might not have full knowledge about local situations in other parts of the world. Whatever the amount of needs analysis, it could never replace physical presence and observation of the dynamics of development, growth and trade in a particular region. He said that his delegation therefore was concerned by some assumptions in the section on outsourcing, particularly paragraph 63 which, among other things, stated that it was the responsibility of WTO Secretariat to educate beneficiaries on WTO Agreements. While he was well aware of the fact that WTO experts in Geneva were most knowledgeable about the legal and prescriptive provisions of any agreement, he questioned what those experts knew about the development implications and the difficulties that those Agreements imposed on some of the WTO Members. Sub-item (ii) of paragraph 63 stated that ""part of the bigger picture in WTO technical cooperation is to establish a relationship with its Members; extensive sub-contracting would rob the organization of such an opportunity"". He asked how the WTO Secretariat which already had the expertise could be robbed of it by extensive sub-contracting when the WTO Secretariat had training programmes which the Secretariat controlled. Sub-item (iii) of paragraph 63 stated that in certain areas, such as agriculture and services, where there were on-going negotiations, outsourcing might be more difficult to organize on any significant scale because of the lack of outside expertise. One of the principal reasons for outsourcing was to allow enhanced expertise to be developed outside the WTO Secretariat, in order to multiply the understanding of the WTO. Furthermore, sub-item (iii) of paragraph 63 also stated that country officials often wished to be advised on their commitments and obligations by WTO professionals who were directly involved in the on-going negotiations and who knew how national policy objectives and constraints could be accommodated in country schedules. He said that in his view that was too presumptuous. He regretted not having been able to participate in the consultations on that issue as it was an issue of interest to him. Paragraphs 62 and 63 were unfair, to the point of being unnecessary.","WTCOMTDM32.pdf","Philippines, WTO, WTO, Committee, on, Trade, and, Development, WTO, WTO, Geneva, Geneva, WTO, Secretariat, WTO, WTO, Geneva, WTO, Members, WTO, Members, WTO, Secretariat, WTO, Secretariat, Secretariat, WTO, Secretariat, WTO, WTO"

"3088",3088,"87","87.     The representative of Australia said that her delegation appreciated efforts to bring improved management and planning into the WTO's technical assistance activities. The emphasis on improved consultations both between line divisions and the Technical Cooperation Division, and also between the WTO and other multilateral and bilateral donors was welcomed. Section V on ""Financing Technical Assistance"" continued the call to have an adequate regular budget allocated to WTO technical cooperation activities. Whilst her delegation agreed that, today, lack of a sufficiently sizeable and stable funding base had detracted from the ability of the WTO to schedule and deliver technical assistance most effectively, her delegation noted that some additional resources were agreed to during the budget deliberations last year and she hoped to see the Secretariat demonstrate the positive impact of that increase prior to more funds being allocated.","WTCOMTDM32.pdf","Australia, WTO, Technical, Cooperation, Division, WTO, WTO, WTO, Secretariat"
"3087",3087,"86","86.      The representative of Norway said that his delegation was among those Members which had underlined the need to have a clear strategy in place for WTO's technical cooperation activities. The strategy paper prepared by the Secretariat was based on several years of experience. The services of the WTO Secretariat had been in great demand and appreciated. However, the resources of the Secretariat had been limited and subject to ad hoc financing. He said that his delegation was in general agreement with most of the points included in the proposed strategy and he appreciated that the Committee on Trade and Development had an opportunity to discuss it. He said that, in the view of his delegation, WTO's technical assistance activities should be funded through the regular budget instead of having to rely heavily on voluntary contributions as was the current situation. Predictable and stable financing was a prerequisite for good planning and thus for the quality of the granted assistance. His delegation would continue its efforts to reach consensus on the proposal to secure financing through the regular budget. In light of the limited financial and human resources available for WTO's technical assistance activities, setting priorities and drawing up a list of beneficiary countries was necessary. His delegation agreed that the different categories of countries mentioned in paragraph 6 should be eligible for assistance. However, his delegation wished to see a clearer priority being given to LDCs in paragraph 20. Paragraph 27 stated that ""any new Agreement being concluded in the WTO should be accompanied by a framework to be put in place to support its implementation"". His delegation agreed that the implementation of new Agreements would be facilitated if associated technical assistance requirements of individual countries were identified. However, whether that should be done through inclusion of technical assistance requirements in the regular WTO budget, specific references in individual agreements, the drawing up of a list of required assistance in relation to each agreement or a combination of those approaches was a question that should be left to Members to agree upon in upcoming negotiations. It was essential to foster WTO's collaboration with other organizations.      A coherent approach had to be ensured, areas of competence and complementarity identified, joint projects defined and executed and duplication avoided. He called on the Secretariat to explain paragraph 39 where it was stated that the WTO should have as objective to become more focussed on specialized activities for which it had a comparative advantage over other organizations. In light of the limited financial resources available, his delegation expected that the technical assistance activities of the WTO were already clearly focussed on its particular sphere of competence. He asked how the limited resources could be put to an even better use. He said that his delegation supported the comments and proposals made concerning the need for better internal coherence within the WTO Secretariat.","WTCOMTDM32.pdf","Norway, Members, WTO, Secretariat, WTO, Secretariat, Secretariat, Committee, on, Trade, and, Development, WTO, WTO, WTO, WTO, Members, WTO, Secretariat, WTO, WTO, WTO, Secretariat"
"3086",3086,"85","85.     The representative of Canada said that her delegation had noted that points taken on board in the revised version of the technical cooperation strategy included the demand-driven approach, the setting of priorities, the relationship with other processes including the Integrated Framework, the                                                                                     WT/COMTD/M/32                                                                                            Page 17 development of multi-year plans, inclusiveness, the private sector, civil society and training institutions and her delegation was grateful for that. However, rather than always providing on-sight training, distance education should receive the appropriate attention. Her delegation seconded the comments made by the representative of Switzerland regarding the coherent administration within the WTO Secretariat of the various aspects of technical assistance and training.","WTCOMTDM32.pdf","Canada, Integrated, Framework, Switzerland, WTO, Secretariat"
"3085",3085,"84","84.      She continued by saying that her delegation also was pleased with the efforts of the Secretariat to set priorities in order to establish a realistic and practical program. Her delegation supported the priorities among the beneficiary countries suggested by the Secretariat. However, she had two remarks in that respect. The first concerned the Training Division. Her delegation wondered if it would not be possible for it to tailor its priorities to the technical assistance needs identified. Even if short-term technical assistance was always available to LDCs, African countries and other targeted countries, it could not substitute for the three-month trade policy courses. Paragraph 21 which stated that all beneficiaries would have access to training at least once during a two-year period, should be considered in a flexible manner in order to give special attention to the LDCs, African countries, non-resident Members and small economies. That would constitute a coherent approach with established priorities in light of the needs identified. That would also make it possible to strengthen links of solidarity in favour of the least favoured countries. However, that should be done without reducing the access to the three-months trade policy courses for other beneficiaries. In the longer run, the solution was therefore to substantially increase the capacity of the WTO Secretariat to carry out training. Despite the tribulations of the Budget Committee which had taken place last year, her delegation remained convinced that the WTO training capacity had to be doubled. Given the lack of resources, priorities had to be defined in terms of the services that the WTO technical assistance could provide. If technical assistance was necessary for NGOs, civil society, the private sector, negotiators or for the training of trainers they all demanded different types of services. Priorities therefore had to be established. The primary role of the WTO Secretariat was to address government officials in the beneficiary countries. Another issue which was not the direct subject of the strategy, but which could have direct implications for the practical implementation of technical assistance was the division of tasks and responsibilities within the Secretariat. Four divisions or separate units were currently providing technical assistance or were directly involved with the questions of trade and development: the Development Division, Technical Cooperation Division, Training Division and the Secretariat Working Group on the Integrated Framework and LDC Issues. These entities were currently placed under the supervision of three different members of the higher level WTO administration. That was a situation which did not favour the application of a coherent technical assistance strategy, in particular when it came to choosing among competing projects according to the priorities defined in the strategy document. Such decisions should be made by one and the same person provided with the adequate power, for example at the level of a deputy director-general. This person should not only be the head of those four sections of the Secretariat mentioned but should also have the power to take all relevant decisions with respect to the administration of the technical assistance strategy.","WTCOMTDM32.pdf","Secretariat, Secretariat, LDCs, Members, WTO, Secretariat, Budget, Committee, WTO, WTO, WTO, Secretariat, Secretariat, Technical, Cooperation, Division, Training, Division, Secretariat, Working, Group, Integrated, Framework, WTO, Secretariat"
"3084",3084,"83","83.     The representative of Switzerland said that the changes had substantially improved the document. In-depth, reflection had been added and there was no doubt that the strategy could be put into practice. She said that her delegation wished to mention the efforts made to include the necessary coordination between the WTO and other international organizations and also among the different divisions within the WTO Secretariat. Her delegation particularly welcomed the fact that the document covered activities of several divisions of the WTO Secretariat. Technical assistance was often considered a right of developing countries. Her government was convinced that technical assistance was necessary, but irrespective of the effort made, it would serve no purpose without the involvement of the beneficiary countries. They were responsible for evaluating their needs and the impact of any assistance depended on the developing countries themselves. Her delegation therefore encouraged the Secretariat to promote an interactive process as suggested in paragraph 9.","WTCOMTDM32.pdf","Switzerland, WTO, WTO, Secretariat, WTO, Secretariat, Secretariat"
"3083",3083,"82","82.     The representative of the United States said that her delegation supported the notion that the WTO should devise a technical assistance strategy. However, she said that her delegation was of the view that it should be concentrated on ensuring that the current technical assistance was being delivered effectively. The paper covered many aspects of implementation modalities and monitoring of technical assistance reasonably well. There seemed to be lower attention paid to donor countries who provided assistance compared to the emphasis on bringing technical cooperation into the regular budget. She said that her delegation did not support that. As had been evident in last falls Budget Committee discussions, some increases for the WTO technical assistance had been approved. However, it had been clear that there was no consensus to bring bilateral technical assistance expenditures on budget. Her delegation could not agree with the proposition in the paper on that WT/COMTD/M/32 Page 16 matter. There were other examples, such as in the U.N. system, where bilateral donations were handled in an effective way to ensure that technical assistance was delivered effectively.","WTCOMTDM32.pdf","United, States, WTO, Budget, Committee, WTO, U.N."
"3082",3082,"81","81.      The Director of the Technical Cooperation Division, Mr. Jean-Maurice Léger, said that he wished to identify only the major changes in the document. These were the result of written and oral comments on the earlier version. Regarding the first section, what had previously been under the three separate headings of ""Definitions"", ""Principles"" and ""Objectives"" had been consolidated and simplified under the heading of ""Definitions and Objectives"". Sub-section B on ""Setting Priorities"" under Section III on ""Implementation Modalities"" had been revised to concentrate on priorities per se. References to high and low priorities had been deleted, meaning that what has been left out were not priorities. The Sub-section on ""Organizing Technical Assistance Activities"" had been revised to state more clearly that the demand-driven approach began with national needs and that the regional focus or sub-regional perspective resulted from national needs and not vice-versa. Another major change related to the order of the sections. The entire Sub-section on ""Organizing Technical Assistance Activities"" had been moved before the Sub-section on ""Modes and Instruments of Delivery"" to show a more logical sequence of steps undertaken. In addition, the issue of ""Internal Coordination"" in WTO of technical assistance had been added to the Sub-section on ""Organizing Technical Assistance Activities"" as a number of delegations had raised that issue. The Sub-section D on ""Modes and Instruments of Delivery"" had been reduced substantially and the details previously in the chapter had been moved to Annex 2. A fifth change related to the title of Sub-section E which had been renamed ""Cooperation with Other Institutions (including bilateral donors)"" to include a reference to bilateral donors. That resulted from the fact that a document and a CD-Rom on ""Sources of trade- related technical assistance"" had been made available to Members last year. That information had been collected following a letter from the Director-General Mike Moore to all international organizations as well as to Members and other institutions providing technical assistance. Section V on ""Financing Technical Assistance"" had been revised in view of the comments received to focus on the need for an adequate regular budget supplemented by volontary contributions and financing from multilateral institutions rather than identifying a short-fall in the regular budget which was the situation currently experienced. Another request by delegations had been to introduce references to the Integrated Framework, JITAP and the three-month trade-policy course offered by the Training Division which had all been incorporated. Finally, a new Annex 3 had been added which listed WTO's comparative advantage in the area of technical assistance.","WTCOMTDM32.pdf","Director, Technical, Cooperation, Division, Jean-Maurice, Léger, WTO, Members, Director-General, Mike, Moore, Members, WTO"

A report by the UN Secretary-General had been prepared for the Preparatory Committee which was holding a second meeting in New York.

He shared the same observations as those made by the representatives of Egypt and Paraguay. The documentation on the South-East Asian experience had not consisted of analytical or motivational studies but trends-analysis which tended to static and experiential. They were therefore of limited value in guiding LDCs and other developing countries as to what their objectives should be in order to benefit from access and transfer of technology, nor did they indicate how WTO norms could assist those countries. What mattered with respect to technology was not think-tanks but large transnational corporations. The value of the seminar would therefore have been enhanced if analytical work had been presented on motivation and marketing strategies for transnational corporations to share their technological know-how with developing countries. The seminar was fortunately only a beginning and his delegation did encourage another seminar of this kind as there was a sincere interest in the issues of technology transfer and access to technology. both of which could be realised through the commercial transactions of transnational corporations, hopefully with support from the WTO TRIPS and Services Agreements.","WTCOMTDM32.pdf","Philippines, Egypt, Paraguay, LDCs, WTO, WTO"

"3064",3064,"65","65.      The representative of the United States said that her delegation had attended many of the sessions of the seminar. She highlighted that emphasised that the chief responsibility of her delegation was to attend the WTO meetings, whether informal or formal. When there was a clash between a need to attend a meeting and a seminar, the seminar would get secondary consideration. However, her delegation had attended the seminar and had found it enlightening, in particular when she heard colleagues speak and advance certain interesting positions. The seminar had helped her delegation to better understand positions that were presented in the deliberative meetings of the WTO. She said paragraph five of the report could be clearer, so as to bring out that it reflected suggestions offered by certain speakers, rather than a general consensus at the seminar or from the panel. While it was mentioned in the first tiret in paragraph five stated that ""some speakers noted"", that type of articulation had been lost in the subsequent tirets. The text therefore sounded too conclusive towards                                                                                    WT/COMTD/M/32                                                                                           Page 13 the end of the report.

The panellists had elaborated on areas of concern to developing countries, especially with respect to strengthening developing countries capacities in the global market. He wished to stress certain issues reiterated during the seminar. His delegation agreed that transfer of technology was an urgent and important element in order to increase the capacity of developing countries to compete in the global market. Developing countries wished to see concrete implementation of transfer of technology as soon as possible. One panellist had said that globalisation presented developing countries with more challenges than opportunities. The seminar had brought out the fact that developing countries should see more opportunities to enhance the transfer of technology in order to increase their capacity. He said that the seminar's discussions on government policies for investment and technical assistance had been interesting. His delegation hoped that the WTO and other organizations dealing with technical cooperation could provide more assistance in strengthening the capacities of developing countries to produce more competitive products for the global market.","WTCOMTDM32.pdf","Indonesia, WTO, Members, WTO"
"3062",3062,"63","63.      The representative of Cuba said that the seminar had been good, although only few delegations had been present. The dates of seminars had to be carefully chosen to increase the number of participants. Many officials had said that developing countries should have better technology as the difference between a developing and a developed country was large in that respect and the gap was increasing daily. If a true contribution to development was to be made, the problem should be looked at carefully and solutions should be sought, holding conferences on technology and looking at the transfer of technology even from the trade point of view. He noted that references had been made to the transfer of technology on commercial terms. However, when firms made investments, they were often not ready to transfer technology. There were sometimes governmental obstacles which meant that some countries were unable to benefit from technology available on the market, and this was harmful to development at the world-wide level. For that reason, his delegation agreed that with the statement made by the representative of Uruguay to the effect that the WTO provisions concerning transfer of technology remained a dead letter. There was a need to change the situation and to make a contribution to the dissemination of technology. His government agreed with the statement made by the representative of Trinidad and Tobago that a working group of transfer of technology was needed. This question had been raised at Seattle and was still of relevance. The possibility of establishing such a working group needed to be examined.","WTCOMTDM32.pdf","Cuba, Uruguay, WTO, Trinidad, and, Tobago, Seattle"
"3061",3061,"62","62.      The representative of the European Communities said that his delegation thanked the Chairman for the report which seemed to be accurate from what had been said by representatives of other delegations. Regarding attendance he said that his delegation had been among those who had had a real problem of scheduling on the day of the seminar. That was the reason why his delegation had only been briefly represented. The solution might not be to have fewer seminars but to try to make ends meet by looking closely at the dates chosen and at the conflicting requirements imposed on delegations. He said that this did not excuse non-attendance of the seminar but added that a member of his delegation also had a medical problem which prevented him from attending the seminar. He said the Chairman's report made a number of important points which his delegation was pleased to see reflected. The first part dealing with appropriate policies to encourage foreign direct investment and accompanying technology transfer made the right points. His delegation was pleased that the key WT/COMTD/M/32 Page 12 policy choices mentioned did not refer to the question of whether a country should choose mandatory requirements on trade-related investment measures, as that particular discussion seemed to belong to a bygone era. Referring to point five of the report, where mention was made of certain specific WTO Agreements, he said there was space for a further discussion on those issues in the WTO, whether in the TRIPS Council, the Committee on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures, or in the GATS context. His delegation would be happy to follow up the discussion in all three fora. The intention of the seminar had precisely been to give new impetus and a broader vision of the development angle of the discussions in the various bodies which dealt more concretely with those issues.","WTCOMTDM32.pdf","European, Communities, Chairman, Chairman, WTO, WTO, Committee, GATS"

The speakers at the seminar had been good and her delegation regretted the low level of participation which did nevertheless not hamper the quality and the richness of the exchange and debate. The seminar had highlighted the importance of technology as a key element of the trade and development process. The point had been brought out with the fact that technical assistance and the transfer of technology were not synonyms and that one could not be a substitute for each other. It was also clear that the WTO Agreements did contain provisions for transfer of technology, but these seemed to be honoured more in the breach than the observance. The seminar had focused too much on the South-East Asian countries. Her delegation had therefore been pleased to hear the interventions by the National Research Council of Canada and by the representative of the Brazilian Ministry of Science and Technology. She suggested that if similar seminars were held in the future, an attempt should be made to broaden their reach to take into account examples involving the broader WTO Membership. She concluded by saying that the Chairman's draft report seemed to be a good one, and added that her delegation supported the call for a working group on transfer of technology in the WTO.","WTCOMTDM32.pdf","Trinidad, and, Tobago, Zambia, WTO, South-East, Asian, National, Research, Council, of, Canada, Ministry, of, Science, and, Technology, WTO, Chairman, WTO"

The discussions during the seminar had been important and rich despite the low attendance. The report provided by the Chairman accurately reflected the items covered during the discussions. However, the report might have been enriched by a few examples of the types of technology transfer initiatives which were ongoing. She said that her delegation was grateful for having had the opportunity to bring in a senior speaker from the National Research Council of Canada who had made specific comments and had provided extensive details about technology transfer programmes in which Canada had been involved in partnership with developing and LDC countries in the past 30 years. Although the discussions had brought out some of the weaknesses of the multilateral system in terms of actually delivering on technology transfer, it had also pointed to a number of interesting ongoing initiatives.","WTCOMTDM32.pdf","Canada, Zambia, Chairman, National, Research, Council, of, Canada, Canada"

The Chairman recalled that the CTD had three outstanding request for observer status from the League of Arab States, from OPEC and from the Gulf Organization for Industrial Consulting. He also noted that, pending the outcome of the General Council process, these would be on an ad hoc basis. Following the previous meeting of the CTD, a request for further information from OPEC in support of its request had been made and copies of the response, received the previous day, were in the room. He asked whether the CTD was in a position to make a decision on these requests.","WTCOMTDM32.pdf","Chairman, CTD, League, of, Arab, States, OPEC, Gulf, Organization, for, Industrial, Consulting, General, Council, CTD, OPEC, CTD"
"3057",3057,"59","59.      The representative of Uruguay said that his delegation thanked the Zambian delegation for having taken the initiative to the technology seminar. The seminar had given delegations an opportunity to review the various multilateral norms, and discuss the transfer of technology and its consequences for developing countries and for the least-developed countries. He underscored the low level of participation from both developed as well as developing countries. The seminar had also given the opportunity to learn about the important work being done by other international organizations such as UNCTAD and UNIDO among others. His delegation was concerned over the fact that the multilateral standards and norms which had to do with transfer of technology within the WTO Agreements were a dead letter. They had not been implemented and what was worse, nothing seemed to be done about it. The fact that the multilateral norms of technology transfer had ceased to                                                                                    WT/COMTD/M/32                                                                                           Page 11 be binding had to be a source of institutional concern to the WTO whose norms and standards within the multilateral trading system were supposed to be binding. His said that his delegation wished to stress, as had also been made manifest during the seminar, that transfer of technology was fundamental to any development policy aimed at inserting developing countries into international trade. There were clear concerns that provisions for technology transfer had not been observed at the multilateral level while there existed initiatives at the bilateral and regional levels which made technology transfer possible. He emphasised that technical assistance should not be confused with technology transfer. That concern had been reflected in paragraph 7 of the draft report of the seminar. The report reflected the suggestions and comments made by delegations participating at the seminar. However, it would be appropriate if, in paragraph 5 on the multilateral norms of technology transfer in the WTO Agreements on TRIPS, Subsidies and Services, the Articles dealing with technology transfer could be specified as they had been mentioned by the Secretariat itself when the item had been introduced.","WTCOMTDM32.pdf","Uruguay, UNCTAD, UNIDO, WTO, WTO, WTO, Secretariat"
"3056",3056,"58","58.      The representative of Switzerland said that, as had been highlighted by the informative presentations, technology was a core component to upgrade and develop an economy. The panellists had managed to explain well the issues surrounding technology and technology transfer and how complex it was to successfully integrate a new technology into the existing structures of an economy. It was rather unlikely that simply handing over a new technology or attracting foreign direct investment in the high-tech field guaranteed a sustained and improved performance for a whole economy. As it had been shown, the absorption capacity of an economy was critical and as well as the existing level of technology education policies, and so on. It had been good to hear concrete examples in from organisations such as UNIDO and UNEP, concerning efforts ongoing in the international community to support technology transfers as well as efforts on a bilateral basis, for instance also by his government which had, as an example, a programme of setting up so-called cleaner production centres in various countries like Brazil, Morocco, Vietnam and India. It was important that delegates in Geneva were aware of such efforts which took place in the context of trade-related technical assistance even though they might not always be directly linked to a particular article in a WTO Agreement. Delegates also needed to be aware that there were other fora which treated the question of technology. The participation at the seminar of WTO Members had to be deplored as it had been rather unsatisfactory. While there was no doubt that it was, in theory, useful to organize such a seminar, it would seem necessary to reflect whether there was really a demand for such types of activities in Geneva. There were time constraints for the delegates and it might be necessary to consider reducing the number of seminars and other events despite their potential usefulness, not least in order not to waste the scare resources of the WTO Secretariat.","WTCOMTDM32.pdf","Switzerland, UNIDO, UNEP, Brazil, Morocco, Vietnam, India, Geneva, WTO, WTO, Members, Geneva, WTO, Secretariat"
"3055",3055,"57","57.      The representative of Egypt said that his delegation wished to thank the delegation of Zambia for taking the initiative to call for a seminar on the issue of technology, trade and development. The level of participation in the seminar by delegations from both developed and developing countries had been disappointing. However, that had not prevented lively and informative discussions, particularly during the second half of the seminar when the structure of the session allowed for interaction between the floor and the panelists. He welcomed the report of the Chairman on the deliberations of the seminar and wished to share with the Committee some of the points and conclusions his delegations had noted during the three sessions. First, technology remained the most important vehicle for development. It was a crucial factor, today more than ever, in determining the competitiveness of developing countries in an increasingly globalized world. Second, transnational corporations had no general interest in the transfer of technology. Hence, openness to foreign direct investment would not guarantee by itself such a transfer. Rather, it would allow Transnational Corporations (TNCs) acquire locational assets and establish international production networks. Reference had been made during the seminar to recent studies that had found that FDI had a weak technology spillover effect, and in some cases a negative one as it affected the ability of local firms to build their capacity to compete. Third, there was a significant difference between transfer of technology and diffusion of technology. The former took place between TNCs and their affiliates and involved purchase of equipment, while the latter involved transfer of knowledge and know-how and was more likely to occur between foreign affiliates and local firms. Those linkages between local suppliers and TNCs affiliates constituted the main channel for the diffusion of know-how as well as the human factor represented by employment. Fourth, developing countries should not seek the mere use of technology and its applications. Rather, ownership of technology held the key for those countries to apply it in order to develop products, manufacture others and ultimately develop new technologies. Fifth, as the study presented by the OECD revealed, although the share of high-tech exports of east Asian countries in the total exports increased, a number of characteristics such as over- dependence on imported components, inputs, imported equipments and foreign research and development rendered them vulnerable, as had been demonstrated by the crises these countries endured in 1997. Sixth, governments' policies were crucial in ensuring that developing countries WT/COMTD/M/32 Page 10 technological capabilities were developed. That was not a fast process, but rather one that would yield results on the medium term. It required a number of factors to be put in place. Governments should have the flexibility to apply policies that ensured that the appropriate investments were attracted to the market. That would be primarily in the areas where domestic enterprises and research and development efforts would benefit from the existence of and linkages with foreign investment. Governments needed to maintain their policy options to adopt such an approach. There was a need to set incentives for foreign direct investment to contribute to the development of domestic human capital. Those should not take the form of competition among developing countries, not even between developing and developed countries. In that regard, it had been mentioned during the seminar that the bargaining power of developing countries in relation to TNCs was diminishing, especially as most of the markets were currently open to foreign direct investment. To overcome that there was a need for an internationally orchestrated effort. Some ideas had been mentioned during the seminar and they had to be followed up. The WTO Agreements clearly dealt with transfer of technology issues in the same way as they dealt with the special and differential treatment provisions, namely, through best-endeavour clauses. Even in the one article where there was a clear commitment, Article 66.2 of the TRIPS Agreement, developing countries were still waiting for its full implementation. Finally, the transfer of technology was a cross-cutting issue in WTO Agreements, which had to be treated horizontally. One of the ways to do so, as mentioned in the seminar, was to consider a working group to examine what bearing do WTO Agreements had on technology policy options for developing countries.","WTCOMTDM32.pdf","Egypt, Zambia, Chairman, Committee, Transnational, Corporations, FDI, OECD, WTO, WTO, WTO"
"3054",3054,"56","56.      The representative of Zambia said that the seminar on technology, trade and development had resulted from a proposal of his delegation. He therefore thanked all involved, especially UNCTAD which had provided both a panellist and a chairman. That type of cooperation between WTO and UNCTAD was important and should continue in other areas. He supported the Chairman's report, on the understanding that the report was without prejudice to what other Members who had attended the seminar had to say. He said that in the view of his delegation, the seminar had been successful. He said that the ability to create new technologies and to acquire and successfully adapt technologies from both external and internal sources were critical determinants of a country's ability to compete successfully. Technology was not confined to product and process technology, but included organisational knowledge. Access to technology was not easy and there were obstacles. There was a place for policies at all levels for promoting transfer of technology, and the WTO Agreement had to be part of those policies. The TRIPS Agreement, in particular, dealt with technology issues and had important implications on transfer of technology to developing countries. He particularly shared the Chairman's regret for the sparsely attended seminar and he hoped that attendance would be better in the future.","WTCOMTDM32.pdf","Zambia, chairman, WTO, UNCTAD, Chairman, Members, WTO, Chairman"

"3042",3042,"45","45.      The representative of Norway said that, since its establishment in 1971, the Norwegian GSP scheme had been enlarged a number of times. Changes had been made both to the list of products entitled to preferential tariff treatment, the list of beneficiary countries and the rules of origin. The objective of the revisions had been to make the Norwegian market more accessible to exports from developing countries and especially the LDCs. Norway's latest notification distributed in document WT/COMTD/N/6/Add.2 showed the consolidated and revised version of the Norwegian GSP scheme and contained an overview of the countries covered by the scheme, the different products entitled to WT/COMTD/M/32 Page 8 preferential tariff treatment and the provisions of rules of origin. For instance, since 1995 all GSP imports of products originating in LDCs were entitled to duty- and quota-free access with the exception of flour, grain and feeding stuffs. In 1998, the Norwegian government had implemented a revised regulation on rules of origin, harmonized with the rules applied by the European Communities and Switzerland. That amendment also opened for bilateral cumulation of origin products originating in Norway. The regulation provided for future diagonal cumulation of origin with products originating in the European Communities and Switzerland on a reciprocal basis. The three parties had recently signed an agreement to that end which would be implemented in the spring of 2001. The consolidated version of the GSP scheme had recently been sent to all Norwegian embassies. The Embassies had been instructed to approach the authorities in a number of beneficiary countries where the GSP scheme is not yet operational. The aim was to inform them about the scheme in order to ensure that preferential tariff treatment would effectively be granted. His government hoped that the initiative would increase the actual utility of the scheme.","WTCOMTDM32.pdf","Norway, GSP, Norway, GSP, LDCs, Switzerland, Norway, Switzerland, GSP"

Those 40 per cent could previously be cumulated across all LDCs and Canada. What had been changed, was that LDCs also could use inputs from other developing countries. If an LDC used an input from a developing country, the Government of Canada allowed that LDC to include that in the content of the 40 per cent up to half, i.e. up to 20 per cent. The idea was to allow LDCs which were sourcing from other developing countries, a greater opportunity to take advantage of access into the Canadian market. He stressed that the change did not mean reducing the level but opening up the ability for LDCs to do some sourcing from developing countries.","WTCOMTDM32.pdf","Canada, Canada, LDCs, Canada, LDC"
"3036",3036,"4","4.       The Chairman of the Sub-Committee on Least-Developed Countries said that, pursuant to the decision taken at the 23rd Session of the SCLDC on 12 February 2001, the proposal on an Integrated Framework Pilot Scheme, together with the recommendations contained in the proposal, had been adopted. He highlighted the four elements of the proposal for the pilot scheme. First, the pilot scheme would initiate the work on mainstreaming a trade integration chapter into country development and poverty reduction strategies. The IF would be the mechanism to assist the trade integration process within the policy framework of the World Bank Poverty Reduction Strategy papers. This was one of the key elements highlighted in the 6 July decision of Heads of IF Core Agencies. The pilot scheme would focus first on those LDCs which had demonstrated a clear choice and commitment to mainstream trade. Once positive results were achieved, consideration would be given, no later than at the WTO 4th Ministerial Conference, to extend the initiative to other LDCs. Second, the pilot scheme had established an IF Trust Fund which was indispensable for the purposes of implementation. The establishment of the IF Trust Fund was also consistent with one of the key objectives of the core agencies, namely, to transform the IF from an unfounded into a funded mandate. Third, the pilot scheme would elaborate a coordinated, sequenced and prioritised programme of technical assistance within the PRS policy framework. This programme of trade- related technical assistance and trade-related capacity building would include infrastructural needs, to WT/COMTD/M/32 Page 2 be considered at either World Bank consultative groups or United Nations on Development Programme round tables. The decision made clear that the trust fund would fund technical assistance exceptionally. Finally, the pilot scheme would establish an IF Steering Committee and at the same time strengthen the existing inter-agency working group. The steering committee would comprise all stakeholders. Members were keen to ensure that the composition of the IF steering committee would improve coordination, ownership, responsibility and involvement of all stakeholders. The decision would provide support to the six core agencies, particularly with regard to the joint statement issued on 6 July 2000. This decision on the IF Pilot Scheme represented the first concrete step in implementing the joint statement. More importantly, the IF had now been placed on a footing where all parties, donors, LDCs, agencies and others had shared responsibilities. After a long period in which no progress had been made on the IF, the Chairman expressed his own sense of relief that negotiations amongst donors, LDCs and agencies had made this decision possible, which he believed would deliver benefits to the most vulnerable Members. Although there was more work to be done on the implementation of the pilot scheme, he hoped that others would share the satisfaction felt by himself and other members of the SCLDC on its adoption. He was confident that this was a major step forward, including in a WTO confidence building in the preparation for the 4th Ministerial Meeting of the WTO.","WTCOMTDM32.pdf","Chairman, World, Bank, Poverty, Reduction, Strategy, IF, Core, Agencies, WTO, IF, Trust, Fund, World, Bank, United, Nations, on, Development, Programme, IF, Steering, Committee, Members, LDCs, Chairman, LDCs, Members, WTO, WTO"
"3035",3035,"39","39.     The representative of Sri Lanka said that the liberalization of rules of origin for the LDCs was a good move in the right direction. However, the Canadian government was going to liberalize the present rules of origin criteria from 40 per cent to 20 per cent. To have a value added of 20 per cent did not make a contribution to an economy. The profit of value-added in the production sometimes was 20 per cent. The proposal would therefore not help the countries. Even when products were brought from one country to the other to be repackaged, the 20 per cent criteria could be met. With a 40 per cent limit, more value-added was possible.

The new measures removed duties on goods from LDCs under 570 tariff items, making LDC exports eligible for duty-free treatment on close to 90 per cent of all Canadian tariff items.

The Community as it was structured was a complete institution designed to promote and diffuse ideals, acts and other commitments which could facilitate central African integration. In terms of the activities carried out during the year 2000, on 5 October 2000 a protocol of cooperation with the WTO had been signed. That protocol aimed at putting in place a programme of capacity building for the officials from CEMAC member states as well as from the Executive Secretariat to enhance the use of the WTO Agreements. To date, the Common External Tariff , the Generalized Preferential Tariff, the Value Added Tax and enterprise/company taxes had been harmonized. In addition, the community investment charter which had been adopted by the Council of Ministers in December 1999, constituted a first-choice instrument for promoting investment in the CEMAC area. The dissemination and the implementation of the community recommendation on competition as well the establishment of a regional stock exchange would be envisioned in the immediate future. CEMAC worked in close collaboration with various other institutions such as the European Communities and the ACP group of countries. The distribution of CEMAC bodies in the region was as follows: the Executive Secretariat of CEMAC was located at Bangui, Central African Republic; the Court of Justice was located at N'djamena, Chad; the Parliament would be located to Malabo, Equatorial Guinea on establishment; and the Banking Commission would be located at Libreville, Gabon.","WTCOMTDM32.pdf","WTO, CEMAC, Executive, Secretariat, WTO, Council, of, Ministers, CEMAC, European, Communities, ACP, Executive, Secretariat, of, CEMAC, Bangui, Central, African, Republic, Court, of, Justice, N'djamena, Chad, Parliament, Malabo, Equatorial, Guinea, Banking, Commission, Libreville, Gabon"

The CEMAC represented a community of over 30 million consumers and whose principal bodies in hierarchical order were: the Conference of Heads of State, which held its first meeting on 24-25 June 1999 in Malabo, the Council of Ministers charged with the economic union, the Ministerial Committee responsible for the monetary union, the Executive Secretariat in charge of general coordination, the Inter-State Committee whose task is to assist the Executive Secretariat in preparing dossiers to be brought up to the Council of Ministers, the Bank of Central African States, the Banking Commission and the specialized bodies of the two unions.","WTCOMTDM32.pdf","Community, Court, of, Justice, Community, Parliament, CEMAC, State, Malabo, Council, of, Ministers, Ministerial, Committee, Executive, Secretariat, Inter-State, Committee, Executive, Secretariat, Council, of, Ministers, Bank, of, Central, African, States, Banking, Commission"
"3019",3019,"24","24.     The achievements of UDEAC, such as the long experience of monetary cooperation was an important inheritance for the Economic and Monetary Union of Central Africa and the charter of the Community reflected this. However, in contrast to the UDEAC, CEMAC had integrated the concept of economic and social development, whereas the UDEAC had basically been focused on economic and customs matters. CEMAC currently comprised six member states: Cameron, Central African Republic, Congo, Gabon, Equatorial Guinea and Chad. Of these six countries, four were least-developed countries and five of the six were Members of the WTO, the exception being Equatorial Guinea. The CEMAC Treaty set the Community the important task of promoting harmonious cooperation of its member states within the framework of economic and monetary union. In both of these domains, the members aimed at going from a situation of cooperation to a union which would further the integration process. The objective of the Central African Economic Union was the convergence of economic and political performances; enhanced competitiveness of economic and financial activities through harmonization of the rules governing their functioning; the promotion                                                                                    WT/COMTD/M/32                                                                                            Page 5 of a business-friendly legal environment; the creation of single markets through free movement of persons, capital, goods and services; and also by coordinating national sectoral policies. The aim of the Central African Monetary Union was to consolidate the means of monetary cooperation which existed since several decades among the member states. The monetary union was based on the following principles: the recognition of a common monetary unit, the CFA Franc, which was the legal tender throughout the territories of the member states and whose issue and management had been confined to a joint autonomous emission institution, the Bank of Central African States (BEAC). The aim of the single monetary and exchange policy was price stability without prejudice to the imperatives linked to the defence of the currency and the general policies elaborated in the Union.","WTCOMTDM32.pdf","UDEAC, Economic, and, Monetary, Union, of, Central, Africa, CEMAC, Cameron, Central, African, Republic, Congo, Gabon, Equatorial, Guinea, Chad, Members, WTO, Central, African, Economic, Union, Central, African, Monetary, Union, Bank, of, Central, African, States, BEAC"
"3018",3018,"23","23.      The representative of Gabon said that she wished to remind Members of the background to the creation of the Central African Economic and Monetary Community (CEMAC). The Community had been created on 24 June 1999 in Malabo, Equatorial Guinea during the conference of heads of state. It replaced the former Customs and Economic Union of Central Africa (UDEAC), which had existed since 1964. Since its independence in 1960, the Central African countries of Cameroon, Central African Republic, Congo, Gabon and Chad had decided to organize their economic cooperation within an institution for regional integration. Their Heads of State had signed the Treaty of Brazzaville on 8 December 1964 which created the UDEAC. On 22-23 November 1972, these states had signed two economic cooperation treaties, one among themselves and another with France, thereby agreeing to a common currency, the CFA Franc, which was the means of financial cooperation in Africa. While monetary cooperation had functioned to the satisfaction of participating member states, it had not generated wider economic cooperation. The overall results of more than 30 years of cooperation within the UDEAC unfortunately seemed modest. Most of the participating countries had actually tried to advance their national interests to the detriment of those of the union. The Republic of Equatorial Guinea joined the UDEAC in 1984 and its economic development had since then been more dynamic. Equatorial Guinea, which was a former Spanish colony, had changed currency to become a member of the CFA Franc region and had officially become a bilingual country. Both French and Spanish were currently officially spoken.","WTCOMTDM32.pdf","Gabon, Members, Central, African, Economic, and, Monetary, Community, Malabo, Equatorial, Guinea, Customs, and, Economic, Union, of, Central, Africa, Cameroon, Central, African, Republic, Congo, Gabon, Chad, Brazzaville, France, Africa"

In the afternoon, various speakers from donor and international agencies outlined examples of international collaborative arrangements at bilateral and multilateral levels that can facilitate the upgrading of developing country technological capabilities. It was emphasised that it was important to differentiate technical assistance from the transfer of technology. At the same time, such assistance can enhance the possibilities for technology absorption, especially through the creation of local and cross-border networks and partnerships – including public-private partnerships; transfer of best practices; and the development of linkage between research institutions and enterprises. Numerous examples were quoted, and a presentation was given by the National Research Council of Canada drawing on its experience of over 30 years in the field of technology-related assistance. It was also pointed out that technical assistance can also play an important role in supporting policy formulation with a view to creating an appropriate enabling environment for the enhancement of technological capabilities.

"3007",3007,"153","153.     The question of capacity development in Least-Developed Countries was given particular attention, and the point was made that their low participation in the world economy was to some extent a reflection of the technology gap they faced relative to their more developed trading partners. Article 66.2 of the TRIPS agreement, which was legally binding on developed country members, had to date been of uncertain benefit. A possible area of action was the development of a concrete list of incentives capable of overcoming special obstacles for technology transfer for LDCs.","WTCOMTDM32.pdf","LDCs"
"3006",3006,"152","152.     When considering policy responses, a key element to consider is the opportunities and challenges for the development of technological capability presented by the WTO agreements and the relation of these agreements to policy options open to developing countries.         •       Some speakers noted that, while technology transfer is one of the objectives of the                 TRIPS Agreement (see Article 7), it is unclear how far this objective has been met.                 While there is evidence to suggest that foreign direct investment responds positively                 and significantly to strong Intellectual Property regimes, especially in sectors that are                 intensive in the use of knowledge-based assets, it was also argued that such response                 may not necessarily be linked to enhanced transfer of technology. Furthermore,                 while patent provisions provide channels that can facilitate the transfer of technology,                 many developing countries had in practice experienced difficulty in making use of                 these.         •       On subsidies, it was noted that the WTO Agreement on Subsidies and Countervailing                 Measures rules out certain aspects of activist industrial policy, based, for example, on                 selective subsidisation, by making them actionable through countervailing measures.                 However, serious questions were posed regarding the utility and effectiveness of such                 policies in any case. Although the Agreement classifies certain types of spending on                 research and development as non-actionable (see Article 8), some examples were                 given of instances where developing countries have had practical difficulties in                 deriving benefits from these provisions.         •       Regarding trade in services, developing countries were encouraged to use the                 flexibility – to date sparingly used – available to them under the GATS to attach                 conditions to their market access offers that would facilitate access to technology (see                 Article XIX.2). Commitments in respect of commercial presence may facilitate                 access to technology, including in critical infrastructure-related areas such as                 telecommunications. However, as in goods sectors, access to technology was not                 necessarily coextensive with transfer of technology.","WTCOMTDM32.pdf","WTO, WTO"
"3005",3005,"151","151.     Upgrading domestic technological capabilities therefore requires governments to create a suitable enabling environment by adopting appropriate policies. Key policy choices for a favourable enabling environment include investment in human capital, with training matched to skills requirements; infrastructure development; establishment of research institutions with close linkages to the private sector and to foreign institutions; and other policies to strengthen the development of the private sector, including competition and regulatory policy, and sound financial and macroeconomic management. It is also important that policy-makers adopt a dynamic perspective, recognising that sources of comparative advantage change over time. For example, while a country may initially benefit from low unit labour costs, dangers exist if production is confined to low level assembly activities that offer little scope to move up the technology ladder. This situation, if not recognised, can lead to increased vulnerability as competitors emerge. It also needs to be recognised that in any industry, the minimal threshold capabilities required simply for survival is likely to rise with time.

"3004",3004,"150","150.     Foreign investment - which includes FDI and other procedures such as joint venture or other ""arms-length"" arrangements - often plays a critical role in the transfer of technology and can contribute to upgrading domestic technological capabilities. But FDI flows also vary enormously across developing countries and are highly concentrated in a few recipients. While foreign investors often provide a first impetus for technological advancement, foreign investment may not automatically lead to an upgrading of technological capabilities. Spill-over effects may be limited, in part owing to the interest that foreign investors – especially multinational companies – may have in safeguarding their technological assets from potential competitors. Equally, the process of transfer is typically costly, requiring significant investment by both parties in a process with uncertain outcomes.","WTCOMTDM32.pdf",""

In the last two decades, the highest growth rates have been recorded in industries, goods and services exhibiting high technology content. The assimilation and absorption of new technologies, especially those intensive in their use of knowledge-based assets, give developing countries the opportunity to catch up with developed country partners, or to ""leapfrog"" stages of development. But, to some extent mirroring overall patterns in developing countries’ trade, there are great disparities in the degree to which developing countries have been able to benefit from the rapid growth in high technology, high value added sectors.","WTCOMTDM32.pdf",""

This had been a year of quite intensive activity and the CTD had made progress in clarifying and sharpening the views of participants in an number of important areas: special and differential treatment, technical cooperation, implementation, on the participation of developing countries in world trade, on trade and technology, on the question even of small economies and many                                                                                    WT/COMTD/M/32                                                                                           Page 27 others. As in the WTO as a whole, one could not avoid a sense of regret that the CTD seemed to move a bit too slowly from consideration of issues to considered action on issues. At the same time, he recognised the importance of hearing all voices and abiding by the principles of transparency and consensus in the work. He was gratified that the CTD had continued to uphold these principles in the past year. The year had seen the announcement of measures or actions implementing improved market access through the GSP schemes in favour of the developing countries and in a number of cases in favour of least-developed countries. Some of these measures had also been implemented by developing countries. There were many challenges ahead for the CTD, and the proposed work programme for 2001 held the promise of an interesting and rewarding year to come. He had no doubt that under the able guidance of his successor, Ambassador Irumba, this would be realised. He wished to thank all participants in the work of the CTD for the cooperative spirit they had shown over the year. This had made his task easier. He was aware that, if at times it had seemed a little less easy, he knew that it was as easy as instructions had permitted. He also expressed his appreciation to the Secretariat, including interpreters. It was gratifying to find that on so many occasions the CTD had moved closer to a common understanding this year including on one of particular interest to his own delegation and he remained optimistic regarding an eventual outcome on all these issues.","WTCOMTDM32.pdf","Chairman, CTD, CTD, WTO, CTD, CTD, GSP, CTD, Ambassador, Irumba, CTD, Secretariat, CTD"

He also introduced the internship scheme for young people from selected countries to permit them to enhance their knowledge of the multilateral trading system and support their mission in participating more actively in the daily activities of the WTO. The selected candidates would ideal be involved in trade policy matters either at home or in Geneva. The programme would be different from other such internship programmes in that the candidates would work within their national missions in Geneva, not in the WTO Secretariat. Assignments would be of 10-12 months duration. They would be able to participate in seminars organised by the Secretariat. The selection of candidates would be made jointly by the WTO Secretariat and the mission in question. More information could be obtained from the WTO Human Resources Section.","WTCOMTDM32.pdf","Director, Development, Division, WTO, Geneva, Geneva, WTO, Secretariat, Secretariat, WTO, Secretariat, WTO, Human, Resources, Section"

Her understanding was that the decision would be to transmit those notifications to the Sub-Committee on Least-Developed Countries for substantive discussion and reporting back while the notifications themselves would continue to be made according to existing practice.","WTCOMTDM32.pdf","United, States, CTG, Least-Developed, Countries, CTD, CTG, CTD, CTG"
"2972",2972,"121","121.     The Chairman said that at several previous sessions of the committee, he had reminded the CTD that, normally, notifications and information provided on changes to GSP were sent to the CTD under the provisions of the Enabling Clause. Accordingly, information on any actions taken by developed Members under their GSP schemes in favour of LDCs would normally be provided in that way, and indeed at the previous meeting the EC and Canada had notified the CTD of planned changes in their programmes to increase market access for LDCs. On the other hand, steps taken by developing countries under the 1999 Waiver on Preferential Tariff Treatment for LDCs were to be notified to the Council on Trade in Goods. As he had said previously, there was an inconsistency in the reporting procedures. In order to resolve that, he had proposed in his fax of 27 November 2000 that any market access measures taken specifically in favour of the least-developed countries, whether under the Enabling Clause and notified to the CTD or under the 1999 waiver and notified to the CTG be transmitted by either body, to the Sub-Committee on LDCs, for substantive consideration. The Sub-Committee would report back to the CTD or CTG, as appropriate, on its discussions. The objective was to allow for a unified consideration in one forum, i.e. the Sub-Committee on Least-Developed Countries, of measures taken in favour of the LDCs. No modification to existing notification procedures was proposed. As Members would recall, he had consulted with the Chairman of the CTG about it who had agreed that it was a pragmatic approach that he could propose to the CTG. Unfortunately, the CTG had not met and he would continue to pursue the matter and monitor CTG action. In the meantime, he proposed that the CTD take a decision on the matter and he put it before the Committee for its consideration. He asked Members whether the proposal was acceptable to the Committee.","WTCOMTDM32.pdf","Chairman, CTD, GSP, CTD, Members, EC, Canada, CTD, LDCs, LDCs, CTD, CTG, Sub-Committee, CTD, CTG, Members, Chairman, CTG, CTG, CTG, CTG, CTD, Committee, Members, Committee"

There was a reference to the chronic debt problem of those referenced above including LDCs and the rest of the paragraph referred to initiatives for LDCs.","WTCOMTDM32.pdf","United, States, United, States, CTD, CTD, LDCs"
"2967",2967,"117","117.     The Chairman also informed the CTD about informal consultations on possible work on small economies. The CTD had been discussing this issues on the basis of the mandate contained in paragraph 6 of the Geneva Ministerial Declaration which noted Ministers' deep concern over the marginalization of LDCs and certain small economies. So far, the work had been on the basis of submissions by Members and discussions in the CTD. At the previous meeting of the CTD, he had undertaken to hold consultations at the request of a delegation on issues relating to small economies. These consultations had been held the previous day. At the consultations there was a large measure of support for the idea that further work should be done in the CTD. It was initially proposed that this further work should undertaken by way of a work programme. Some Members could not agree with the proposal for a work programme at this time. The main concern expressed was that this would entail creation of a new category of developing countries. For their part, Members seeking further work on small economies maintained that their objective was only to identify trade-related issues that were of concern to small economies given certain special constraints that they faced. In light of this inability of some Members to support a work programme a modified proposal was made for a study by the Secretariat. While many Members were supportive of this, it was also clear that others would wish more information and greater clarity regarding the nature of the proposed study to facilitate consideration of and a decision on the matter. As a result, the Chairman therefore propose to request the Secretariat to draw up terms of reference for a possible study on trade-related constraints on small economies and that further consultations be held on the proposal for a study when the terms of reference became available. Any Member was free to submit any new documentation relating to any issue affecting small economies.

He said that the Secretariat was also required to prepare a document on the participation of developing countries in international trade, and that the issue of preferences could also be discussed in this context. He said that one operational problem was that there was a dearth of information on the structure of preferential schemes, and that what information was present was rather piecemeal.

In particular, Zambia had requested a seminar on Technology Issues, and this was planned for February 2001. A seminar on e-commerce, to be held in May 2001, followed from the CTD's earlier discussion on the issue earlier, at the 30th and 31st Sessions. A third seminar, possibly linked to the Geneva Week, was proposed for September 2001 on ""Trade-Related Policies and Strategies for Development"". This would look at national and multilateral policies and strategies for development, and the interaction between the two. Some of these issues have been raised during the discussion in 2000 of the Secretariat paper on the participation of developing countries in world trade and the discussions on implementation of WTO agreements. A number of developing countries are also concerned about developing an appropriate supply response to market opportunities, and the discussion might therefore also encompass the kinds of domestic and external policies, including appropriate macro-and micro policy structures, the identification and resolution of bottlenecks, capacity-building, trade facilitation etc. needed to develop such a response. The Chairman said that in all cases, reports on the seminars by the Chairperson would be presented to the subsequent CTD meetings for formal discussion and annexed to the minutes of those meetings.","WTCOMTDM31.pdf","Chairman, CTD, Zambia, CTD, Secretariat, WTO, Chairman, Chairperson"

He said that cooperation between various secretariats seemed to be taking place, and Members needed to be informed about this. He agreed that it would be useful to hear in more detail from the Chairman as to how he thought the CTD should proceed. He said that either the CTD was serious about its mandated role from the General Council, or else – and he found this undesirable – Members would have to face the fact that there was no role for the CTD in the Financing for Development process.","WTCOMTDM31.pdf","European, Communities, Chairman, CTD, General, Council, Finance, for, Development, CTD, Members, Chairman, CTD, CTD, General, Council, Members, CTD"

The Chairman said it was possibly useful to hold informal consultations in the CTD to the possible elements of submission from Members, in order to obtain a sense of the direction in which Members were headed, and to ascertain whether there was existing material on which Members could draw, and what additional materials might be needed.","WTCOMTDM31.pdf","Chairman, CTD, Members, Members, Members"
"2926",2926,"92","92.      The Director of the Development Division said it was important that the CTD have an opportunity to comment to the co-Chairs of the event on Members' views. He said there were a number of documents that Members could have for that meeting: one was the inter-secretariat paper, though it remained to be seen whether the WTO Secretariat was in a position to associate themselves with the paper. The Secretariat could also make available the inputs it had itself made available for the discussions on international trade; there may be other possibilities for an analytical paper; and finally, there was the overview paper on Developments in the International Trading System which was to be discussed in the General Council.","WTCOMTDM31.pdf","Director, Development, Division, CTD, Members, Members, WTO, Secretariat, Secretariat, General, Council"
"2925",2925,"91","91.     The Chairman said that the situation could be summed up as one in which Members clearly desired for there to be a Member-driven input to the process. He said that the original approach that had been agreed would have had the Secretariat prepare an analytical paper as a basis for discussion, and a basis on which Members could finalise their input to the Preparatory Committee. He said that this paper was not under preparation; the Secretariat had been limiting itself to comment on papers prepared elsewhere. He said that given the clear desire of members for a Member-driven approach, the approach that now needed to be taken was to invoke the original approach, namely to have an analytical document which could be used as a basis for finalising it input.

He recalled that the CTD planned to consider its input to the High-level Meeting on 8 February 2001. He said that the WTO had a comparative advantage in matters of trade, and that it should bring forth its contribution regardless of the contributions made by other organisations. The WTO had all the tools in its hand to make comment on those parts of the document which were connected to WTO activities. He said that it was not clear whether by the end of December WTO Members were going to have a document, or whether Members had to await February to make comments.","WTCOMTDM31.pdf","Mexico, United, States, Norway, WTO, WTO, WTO, WTO, Members, Members"

"2920",2920,"87","87.     The Director of the Development Division said that the WTO Secretariat paper was commenting on the draft of a paper on trade prepared by the UNCTAD. It was his understanding that the paper was to be delivered to the UN secretariat in New York. He said that the regional consultations referred to by the observer from UNCTAD were a separate issue; these regional consultations had taken place since August, and there were five such consultations planned.

He also recalled that there had been an impressive delegation from New York which had met with Members and the Secretariat and had urged the WTO to make a substantive input. The question now was how the CTD was to make this substantive input into the trade chapter of the conference. His delegation was of the view that the request of the Preparatory Committee needed to be honoured, that a substantive debate needed to take place in the organisation and that the expertise of the organisation needed to be used, and that Members should not be presented with a paper that was not reflective of the variety of views within the Membership. His delegation was therefore of the view that the process to be followed was that which had been set out in the 30th Session.","WTCOMTDM31.pdf","European, Communities, Secretariat, New, York, Members, Secretariat, WTO, CTD, Preparatory, Committee, Members"
"2913",2913,"80","80.     The Chairman said that when the issue had been discussed at the 30th Session initially, it had been agreed at that time that the Secretariat would produce an analytical paper, which the CTD was to take along with other relevant material and discussions between Members, to prepare its input for submission to the preparatory committee. He said that it appeared from the presentations made that the Secretariat was not going to produce an analytical paper but was providing comments on a paper prepared by the UNCTAD, and that this was to from part of the contributions on which the Secretary-General would draw for the final report. In these circumstances, the Chairman opened the question of how to proceed.","WTCOMTDM31.pdf","Chairman, Secretariat, CTD, Members, Secretariat, UNCTAD, Chairman"

"2911",2911,"79","79.     The Director of the Trade and Finance Division said that he was participating in his individual capacity in the working groups, and not as the WTO representative, that the working group on ""mobilizing international resources for development: foreign direct investment and other private flows"" was chaired by the UNCTAD and the draft of the report was nearly complete. The report made only passing reference to the WTO's work on Trade and Investment and Trade and Competition. One of the 15 recommendations was relevant in this regard; the recommendation proposed that the Secretary-General convene a series of ""Global Hearings on Foreign Direct Investment"" involving business, civil society and governments, with a fact finding, rather than a prescriptive role, with an aim to discuss the pros and cons of international investment agreement and their contribution to development. Regarding the working group on ""addressing systemic issues; enhancing the coherence and consistency of the international monetary, financial and trading systems in support of development"", it had been thought that work was at an advanced stage, but that a new draft, prepared in New York, had been received which was quite radically different from anything participants in the working group had seen up to that point.","WTCOMTDM31.pdf","Director, Trade, and, Finance, Division, WTO, UNCTAD, WTO, New, York"
"2910",2910,"78","78.      The Director of the Development Division said that the WTO Secretariat was participating in three inter-secretariat Working Groups in preparation for the High-Level Event: on ""mobilizing international resources for development: foreign direct investment and other private flows""; ""international trade""; and ""addressing systemic issues; enhancing the coherence and consistency of WT/COMTD/M/31 Page 16 the international monetary, financial and trading systems in support of development"". The Development Division of the WTO was the lead WTO division on the ""international trade"" working group, whose coordinator is Mr. J. Cuddy, Director, International Trade Division, UNCTAD. The Trade and Finance Division of the WTO was the lead division for the other two groups (coordinators – Mr. Karl Sauvant, UNCTAD, and Mr. Barry Herrmann, UN, New York). The reports of the inter-secretariat Working Groups, which were currently at various stages of advancement, were to feed into a report to be prepared by the Secretary-General of the UN, which was to be submitted to the Preparatory Committee in mid-January: The WTO Secretariat was involved in the preparations of the various draft reports of the inter-secretariat working groups. The PrepCom itself was expected to start work in February 2001 (dates of 13-23 February were tentatively in the calendar). The co-chairs of the PrepCom were Ambassador Jørgen Bøjer (Denmark) and Ambassador Asda Jayanama (Thailand).","WTCOMTDM31.pdf","Director, Development, Division, WTO, Secretariat, WTO, WTO, J., Cuddy, Director, International, Trade, Division, UNCTAD, Trade, and, Finance, Division, WTO, Karl, Sauvant, UNCTAD, Barry, Herrmann, UN, New, York, UN, Preparatory, Committee, WTO, Secretariat, Ambassador, Jørgen, Bøjer, Denmark, Ambassador, Asda, Jayanama, Thailand"

As members may be aware, the manner in which the UN had structured the preparatory process for the High Level Event had been to establish six working groups: Domestic Financial Resources; FDI and other private flows; International Trade; International Financial Cooperation through, inter alia, ODA; External Debt; and Systemic Issues; enhancing coherence and consistency of the international monetary, financial and trading systems in support of development. A report by the UN Secretary-General was planned to be delivered to the Preparatory Committee by mid-January 2001. The WTO Secretariat was already involved in three of the preparatory working groups: on foreign direct investment and other private flows; trade; and systemic issues, and was contributing to inter-Secretariat work on these topics. The Chairman invited the Secretariat to brief the CTD on the state of play.","WTCOMTDM31.pdf","UN, UN, Domestic, Financial, Resources, International, Trade, International, Financial, Cooperation, ODA, UN, Preparatory, Committee, WTO, Secretariat, Chairman, Secretariat, CTD"

The notification requirements under the waiver were for preferences to be notified to the CTG, while notifications under the Enabling Clause were made to the Sub-Committee. All that was being proposed was that the notifications in respect of least-developed countries under both instruments be referred to the Sub-Committee for substantive consideration. He saw that there was a need for a greater level of comfort on the part of delegations regarding the proposals, and he therefore proposed that further consultations be held on the subject.","WTCOMTDM31.pdf","Chairman, CTG"

The representative of Sri Lanka endorsed the views of the Chairman relating to market access mesures falling under the GSP, and said her delegation had no problem with such measures. Her delegation's concern was with measures falling outside the scope of the GSP. She referred to the case of South Korea which had not been historically a preference giver but which could claim to be a GSP giving country. She said that there were some developing countries that gave preference coverage outside the GSP scheme, and her question was how these were to be notified. She said that when a waiver was given, the notifications made thereafter needed to be made on certain procedures. There was a legal lacuna that needed to be addressed.","WTCOMTDM31.pdf","Sri, Lanka, Chairman, GSP, GSP, South, Korea, GSP"

"2902",2902,"70","70.     The Chairman said it was not entirely clear as to what the import of the statement made by the representative of Sri Lanka was. He recalled that changes to the GSP were notified under the Enabling Clause, so that any changes in respect of LDCs would also be made under the Enabling Clause. He said that the 1999 waiver decision required that notifications were to be made to the Council for Trade in Goods, and that as a result, market access measures in respect to LDCs were notified to two different WTO bodies: those taken under the Enabling Clause went to the CTD, and those taken by developing countries under the 1999 waiver went to the CTG. The objective was to                                                                                    WT/COMTD/M/31                                                                                           Page 15 have all notifications pertaining to LDCs referred to a single body – namely the Sub-Committee on LDCs – for substantive consideration and reporting out.","WTCOMTDM31.pdf","Chairman, Sri, Lanka, GSP, Council, for, Trade, in, Goods, WTO, CTD, CTG"

She recalled that at the outset some Members had highlighted certain difficulties they would encounter with respect to the waiver because it was argued that the basis for notifications was the Enabling Clause. Others Members had argued that a waiver was necessary. She said that the Chairman now proposed that notifications be done under the Enabling Clause, and that she could not understand the rationale behind this proposal. She said that a mistake had been made to introduce a waiver and then say that notifications were to be made under the Enabling Clause. She said that if one looked to past practice, the GSP was introduced as a waiver, and was then brought under the Enabling Clause in 1979. She said her similar exercise needed to be done with the waiver for LDCs, and until such time her delegation would have certain reservations.","WTCOMTDM31.pdf","Sri, Lanka, Members, Members, Chairman, GSP"
"2899",2899,"68","68.      The Chairman said that in the past he had recalled to the attention of the CTD that, normally, notifications and information provided on changes to GSP were sent to the CTD under the provisions of the Enabling Clause. Accordingly, information on any actions taken by Members under their GSP schemes in favour of LDCs were normally be provided in this way, and indeed at the last meeting, Canada had made a statement to the CTD of planned changes in their programmes to increase market access for LDCs. On the other hand, steps taken by developing countries under the 1999 Waiver on Preferential Tariff Treatment for LDCs were to be notified to the Council on Trade in Goods. The Chairman had had the opportunity to discuss the issue with the WTO Legal Affairs Division, and it seemed that the most pragmatic solution to achieve consistency in the examination process was for both the Council for Trade in Goods and this Committee to refer notifications under the Enabling Clause and the 1999 waiver to the Sub-Committee on LDCs, for substantial examination and reporting back. The Chairman indicated that he had consulted on this issue with the Chairman of the CTG who had agreed that this was a pragmatic approach that he could also propose to the CTG when it met again.","WTCOMTDM31.pdf","Chairman, CTD, GSP, CTD, Members, Canada, CTD, LDCs, LDCs, Chairman, WTO, Legal, Affairs, Division, Council, for, Trade, in, Goods, Committee, Chairman, Chairman, CTG, CTG"

The Chairman recalled that, following the 30th Session of the CTD in September, an informal meeting of the CTD was organized jointly with Geneva Week to obtain briefings from various agencies to help the CTD to formulate its report to the General Council. During this informal meeting, representatives of UNCTAD, ITC, ITU, and WIPO made presentations on their work on electronic commerce and we also heard from Secretariat staff on WTO's work in this field. The CTD also had some limited time to discuss some concerns and questions raised by Members. On the basis of the discussions, the Chairman had prepared the draft report on e-commerce that was discussed at the meeting on 27 October 2000. At that meeting a number of comments were offered on the draft, and on the basis of those comments the Chairman had prepared a new draft for consideration by the WT/COMTD/M/31 Page 14 CTD. This document, which inter alia re-listed all the ""points for further study"" that were brought up in the earlier meetings of the CTD, had been distributed and was available in the room. He said he presented this report, as a Chairman's report – not necessarily as an agreed report of the CTD - to the December meeting of the General Council. The Chairman proposed that the report be discussed in informal mode. The Secretariat would, in the light of any comments, make any further adjustments that were necessary to enable the CTD to be in a position to take note of the report.","WTCOMTDM31.pdf","Chairman, CTD, CTD, Geneva, Week, CTD, General, Council, UNCTAD, ITC, ITU, WIPO, Secretariat, WTO, CTD, Members, Chairman, Chairman, CTD, CTD, Chairman, CTD, General, Council, Chairman, Secretariat, CTD"

The representative of the European Communities said that his delegation could have lived with the report as it had been originally presented, but that since others had made comments he would do so as well. His delegation did not think it opportune to substitute the discussion held elsewhere on a horizontal task force by a new discussion on the same topic in the CTD. He noted that paragraph 4 raised a number of questions, and that issues which had been discussed went beyond what was stated in paragraph 4. It was important to concentrate on what the CTD could put forward in this discussion, and a treatment of classification and other such issues within the CTD was unlikely to be of help unless there was a clear reason to do so from a development point of view. His delegation was of the view that perhaps the formulation of paragraph 4 could be amended to convey that there was no foreclosure of a discussion on any particular issue elsewhere. He said that if a precise input was to be made by or after December, it was important to concentrate on the experience and know-how the CTD could bring to the broader discussion that was going on elsewhere, and to avoid duplication.","WTCOMTDM31.pdf","European, Communities, CTD, CTD, CTD, CTD"

The representative of Canada said that over the past two years, the four subsidiary bodies concerned had conducted useful work on electronic commerce, but that further work needed to be done. He said that there was a benefit to having a broad perspective on electronic commerce. His delegation was of the view that the establishment of an ad hoc horizontal task force under the auspices of the General Council was a good way of maintaining this broad perspective. The ad hoc task force was to operate on a non-negotiating basis, was to have clear terms of reference, and its existence was                                                                                    WT/COMTD/M/31                                                                                           Page 13 to be reviewed at the next Ministerial Meeting. His delegation supported the proposal made by Japan that the CTD in its report to the General Council mention the existence of support in the CTD for the examination of cross-cutting issues through the establishment of a horizontal, non-negotiating task force. His delegation supported the reformulation suggested by the United States to paragraph 2 of the draft Chairman's report in order that it read ""without prejudice to any decision that may be taken by the General Council relating to the work programme on electronic, including its structure"". His delegation supported the Japanese proposal to replace the ""CTD's work"" with ""development related aspects"". With regard to paragraph 4, his delegation found it useful to draw on the illustrative list. Referring to comments made by Bangladesh on donor initiatives, his delegation was of the view that Canadian efforts should also be included, in particular the efforts of the Canadian Development Research Centre to provide Internet access in Asia and Africa.","WTCOMTDM31.pdf","Canada, General, Council, Japan, CTD, General, Council, CTD, United, States, Chairman, General, Council, CTD, Bangladesh, Asia, Africa"
"2887",2887,"57","57.     The representative of India said that the briefing session of 25 October had provided a wealth of information on the economic, developmental and financial aspects of global electronic commerce. WT/COMTD/M/31 Page 12 She said that some of the suggestions for modification to the draft Chairman's report went somewhat beyond the scope of discussion held in the CTD at its 30th Session and 31st Session. Her delegation understood that reports made by the Chairman were to be of a factual nature, and that this particular report was to be on the progress made by the CTD on all aspects of the mandate. The report needed to bring out those instances when horizontal issues were discussed, and instances when - if at all - any of the substantive issues were discussed. She had attended the briefings made by the international organisations and the WTO secretariat during the informal session of the CTD of 25 October devoted to electronic commerce. She did not agree with everything that had been said on that occasion: in particular, she had heard it stated that the GATS guaranteed the right to do business electronically, that this was neither accidental nor incidental, and that this had been in the mind of some negotiators involved in the GATS. She had also heard it said that technological neutrality was fundamentally important and that this was an issue which had emerged from the work programme. She said that she had revisited the reports made by the subsidiary bodies to the General Council, and could not find any agreement by Members that these were conclusions that had been collectively reached. While she did not intend to engage into a substantive discussion on matters that were under the remit of the Council for Trade in Services, she was of the view that it was useful to report that a briefing session had been held on 25 October, and that at the 31st Session there had been no substantive discussion, as the agenda itself only provided for a consideration of the report to the General Council. She said that, in order that the report remain factual, paragraph 2 of the report which read that the ""CTD sees an interest in continued work"", should also reflect the fact that the CTD had not completed its work (as was well set out in WT/COMTD/19) that it could not take up further work on any of the issues listed for further work, and that hence it endorsed continuation of work on development-related aspects of electronic commerce. With respect to paragraph 3, she said that she agreed that the economic, financial and development needs were set out in the Global Declaration of May 1998, and that work on development related aspects of electronic commerce was of a cross-cutting nature, but that the view of her delegation was that the work of the CTD was complementary to that of the three other councils. That is, the other three councils were supposed to take into consideration the economic, financial and developmental aspects of electronic commerce in their own mandates. With respect to paragraph 4, she echoed the views expressed by other delegations that it may not be appropriate to single out three issues from the list contained in paragraphs 24 to 35 of document WT/COMTD/19. She said that instead of identifying any of the tirets, the CTD should note that an illustrative list of points which had been identified in July 1999 was not taken up in any of its areas and that it should be noted that these remained areas where further study was required. Her delegation noted that Japanese delegation had made mentioned of a number of further interesting areas for study such as the greater participation of developing countries in electronic commerce. Her delegation was of the view that the CTD should consider ways and means of enhancing the participation of developing countries in electronic commerce, and that it was necessary to ensure that the market access opportunities for developing countries were not eroded by the substitution of traditional means of conducting commerce by electronic means. She said that in respect of paragraph 6, the Global Ministerial Declaration provided for taking into account the work conducted in other organisations, and her delegation was flexible as to what could be undertaken in terms of collaboration, provided the mandate set out by the Declaration was respected. Referring to the point made by the delegation of Japan that the CTD had identified a number of issues for further work to be addressed by a horizontal task force in a non-negotiating way. She said that this was an issue in respect of which the Chairman of the General Council was holding consultations on how to proceed, and that it was not appropriate to make any substantial reference to this topic in the CTD's report.","WTCOMTDM31.pdf","India, Chairman, CTD, Chairman, CTD, WTO, CTD, GATS, General, Council, Members, Council, for, Trade, in, Services, General, Council, CTD, CTD, CTD, CTD, CTD, Japan, CTD, Chairman, General, Council, CTD"

His delegation was therefore supportive of the work of the CTD on electronic commerce. In this context, his delegation urged that the CTD connect its work with recent initiatives undertaken by two large economies – the ""Internet for Economic Development"" of the United States and the Okinawa Initiative launched in Japan. His delegation stressed the importance of institutional coordination with these two initiatives. Referring to paragraph 6 of the draft Chairman's report, his delegation suggested that after the words ""cooperation with other agencies"" be inserted the words "" and countries, particularly the recent Japanese and US initiatives in this area"".","WTCOMTDM31.pdf","Bangladesh, CTD, CTD, United, States, Okinawa, Initiative, Japan, Chairman, US"
"2885",2885,"55","55.     The Chairman clarified that it was not the intention of the report to state that the work of the CTD did not relate to goods, services, and intellectual property. The point was that the work of the CTD was cross-cutting and related to these issues and others. The point was taken that the formulation could be made in a more felicitous manner. In respect to the question of cooperation with other organisations, he noted that paragraph 6 of the report allowed for the input of other organisations.","WTCOMTDM31.pdf","Chairman, CTD, CTD"
"2884",2884,"54","54.      The representative of Mauritius said that his delegation could only make preliminary comments at the 31st Session. His delegation recognised the value of having the non-resident Members and Observers participate in the informal session on electronic commerce held on 25 October 2000. He said that the statements made by the USA and Japan were useful, and that the Chairman, in re-drafting the report, should make use of the creative language employed by Japan and terms such as ""e-equality"" and ""Digital Divide"". His delegation shared the view expressed by Pakistan that the CTD should not seek to pre-empt the discussion of any issue. With reference to paragraph 3, he suggested that the definition of the CTD's mandate be an inclusive one rather than an exclusive one; it was difficult to say that the CTD's work did not relate to intellectual property, goods or services. With regard to bullet 1 of paragraph 4, it was important to link the work of the WTO with that of other international organisations. Another question was how could the work of the WTO was tied up in the work of the Integrated Framework, particularly if questions related to infrastructure were to be addressed. He said that the representative of the United states had made a useful intervention relating to the role of electronic commerce in small economies, and added that since she had identified Mauritius as a small economy, this meant that she did indeed have a definition of small economies.","WTCOMTDM31.pdf","Mauritius, Members, USA, Japan, Chairman, Japan, Pakistan, CTD, CTD, CTD, WTO, WTO, Integrated, Framework, United, Mauritius"
"2883",2883,"53","53.      The representative of Uruguay said his delegation was open and flexible with regard to the draft report by the Chairman to the General Council. Notwithstanding this, his delegation wished to recall that the mandate set by the General Council on 17 July established 3 points: first, that the four subsidiary bodies were to reinvigorate their work programmes in their respective areas of competence;                                                                                     WT/COMTD/M/31                                                                                            Page 11 second, the four subsidiary bodies were to identify horizontal issues, that is issues which went beyond the ambit of their own particular areas of competence, and which had a relation to various sectors and ambits of the organisation. The third point was that results of the work were to be communicated to the December General Council meeting. His delegation was of the view that the CTD needed to take into account document WT/COMTD/19, where in paragraphs 24 to 35 an illustrative list of questions was identified for further study. The range of issues identified in this document went well beyond the range of issues identified in paragraph 4 of the draft Chairman's report. He said it was one thing to identify issues for the sake of identifying them, and another for to identify issues for the sake of further study. The later aim was the intention of paragraphs 24 to 35 of Document WT/COMTD/19, and this had not yet been fulfilled. The time remaining until the December meeting of the General Council was not sufficient to exhaust the discussion of the questions identified. In this sense, his delegation was flexible as to the report that the CTD was to forward to the General Council, but was of the view that the issues identified in the CTD required in depth study, and that therefore the work of the CTD on electronic commerce needed to proceed beyond December. Regarding the mandate by the General Council to identify cross-cutting issues, his delegation was of the view that the very theme of development was a horizontal one in its relationship to electronic commerce.","WTCOMTDM31.pdf","Uruguay, Chairman, General, Council, General, Council, CTD, Chairman, General, Council, CTD, General, Council, CTD, CTD, General, Council"
"2882",2882,"52","52.      The representative Pakistan said that his delegation needed more time to dwell on the draft report. From the outset, his delegation could go along with paragraphs 1,2,5 and 6 without changes. In connection to paragraphs 3 and 4, he referred to WT/COMTD/19, and said that any a priori exclusion of any of the points in the illustrative list for further study refered to in that document, would not be beneficial. He said that the issues raised in paragraphs 24 to 35 of the illustrative list of WT/COMTD/19 could not be taken in isolation, and it was not possible to say that discussions on these items had been exhausted. His delegation shared the view that electronic commerce had an impact on revenues other than customs revenue, and this needed to be taken into account. His delegation was of the view that the best way to proceed would be to have informal consultations on the draft report. His delegation did not wish to comment on the question of cross-cutting issues, as that was a discussion best left for the future.","WTCOMTDM31.pdf","Pakistan"
"2881",2881,"51","51.     The representative of Argentina said that his country attached great importance to all the points for further study identified by the CTD. It attached particular importance to the third point in paragraph 4 which related to the impact of electronic commerce on customs revenue. Argentina also had an interest in the impact of electronic commerce on other fiscal revenues, and suggested that the wording on point 3 of paragraph 4 be amended to reflect this.","WTCOMTDM31.pdf","Argentina, Argentina"
"2880",2880,"50","50.      The representative of Japan said his delegation had found the informal session held on 25 October had been informative. He noted that many delegations had stated that developmental issues raised in connection with e-commerce had wider implications. His delegation was therefore convinced that the realisation of ""e-equality"" required serious examinations in a horizontal manner. His delegation was of the view that electronic commerce had become an engine of economic growth and the expansion of trade, and emphasised the importance of the role of the private sector and the avoidance of unnecessary government restrictions or regulations. Turning to the draft report by the Chairman, the representative of Japan recalled that the CTD had identified in document WT/COMTD/19 an illustrative list of points for further study on a horizontal basis. According to that document, points included: Would unrestricted, unregulated electronic commerce provide increased market access for enterprises in developing countries? How would supply and demand for particular goods and services be affected by electronic commerce on a disaggregated level? What were the substitution effects of e-commerce in trade? What effects would e-commerce have on competition in different sectors? What would be the impact of e-commerce on domestic producers in specific sectors? What were the effects of inter-firm relations in e-commerce? How would e-commerce affect Members' obligations and commitments in the WTO Agreements? Therefore, in the CTD's report to the General Council in December 2001, and in the context of the General Council's request that the subsidiary bodies identify cross-sectoral issues, Japan proposed that the Chairman make the following points in his report: first, after paragraph 4 of the draft report, he said a statement needed to be made to the effect that the CTD had identified an illustrative list of questions warranting further study on a horizontal basis. Second, that at the 30th and 31st Sessions of the CTD Members had raised as issues the participation of developing country Members in electronic commerce; how to deal with the ""digital divide""; classification issues; and the simplification of trade procedures through electronic means. There was broad support for the view that such issues be explored through an ad hoc task force and within a reasonable time-frame. Commenting on paragraph 3 , his delegation thought that paragraph 3 was correct, but should be modified to read ""development aspects of electronic commerce do not relate particularly to goods, services, and so forth"".","WTCOMTDM31.pdf","Japan, Chairman, Japan, CTD, Members, WTO, CTD, General, Council, General, Council, Japan, Chairman, CTD, CTD, Members, Members"

"2877",2877,"48","48.      The representative of the United States said that, the wording of paragraph 2 needed to read, ""without prejudice to any decision that may be taken by the General Council relating to the work programme on electronic commerce, including its structure"", as it was the understanding of her delegation that the structure of the work programme was not the only issue to be taken up by the General Council at its December meeting. She recalled that in discussions in the CTD, her delegation had stated on a number of occasions that electronic commerce was a tool for development, and not simply an area of which developed countries had taken advantage and where they had made advances. She said the United States had, once the WTO had agreed to the 1998 Declaration which included reference to the specific financial and economic needs of developing countries, initiated, in addition to the Africa project on electronic commerce, a specialised pilot project which covered countries from all areas of the world. She said that electronic commerce had in the United States been an engine for the growth and development of small and medium-scale enterprises, by helping them play on a level playing field with larger enterprises. She said that e-commerce would be of benefit to countries considering themselves to be small economies, as well as larger developing economies which needed to compete with one another as well as developed economies. She said that cooperation between firms in developed and developing countries led to a win-win situation, where developed country companies had access to additional markets and developing countries gained access to markets previously unexploited. She pointed to examples mentioned in other fora which showed that developing countries could market traditional products over the Internet; to research by the UNCTAD that had illustrated some of the markets in which developing countries could participate; and to the example of India which was a leader in the export of software products and whose success could be emulated by smaller economies. She said that the United States had enhanced the pilot project, and was working on joint bilateral projects. The United States recognised that capacity-building was a critical area for developing countries in relation to e-commerce. She said that electronic commerce created a better environment for access to technology. She also recalled that a number of developed countries announced in Okinawa, Japan a major initiative which was geared to capacity-building, and which introduced ""DOT Force"", that is the Digital Opportunity Task-Force aimed at addressing the ""digital divide"". She said she had referred to these different initiatives as they were complementary to the exercise being undertaken in the WTO, which was distinctly related to trade liberalisation and the avoidance of measures that would impede the growth of e-commerce and the advantages to be derived by developing countries. Her delegation had stated in other bodies that it was clear that WTO rules did apply in the area of electronic commerce. What was being engaged in was clarification on how such rules helped foster electronic commerce for developed and developing country Members of the WTO. Her delegation endorsed the elements highlighted by the Chairman in the draft report, adding that further consideration could be given to the elements of the seminar on electronic commerce to be held in 2001. She recalled that the CTD had held a seminar in 1999 which had been of value to large degree because of the participation of developing country entrepreneurs, including from Africa. She said that it had been encouraging to hear of developments from such participants. It was therefore useful to see what could be done through the CTD and its proposals to the General Council, and through the work of other international organisations. Her delegation had seen a circular from the Director-General that a symposium was to be held on 31 October on the results of the ITC Executive Forum, which had been a very hands-on and practical exercise. She said that it was her understanding that participants from the private sector were also to take part.

"2876",2876,"47","47.     The Chairman said the briefings had been very useful, but it seemed that the CTD might consider going into the matter in more depth. Based on the discussions during the last two meetings of the CTD, the Chairman had circulated a draft report for the General Council, for consideration by the CTD. The Chairman said he would, pending agreement by Members, submit the report to the General Council, on his own responsibility, for the December meeting.","WTCOMTDM31.pdf","Chairman, CTD, CTD, Chairman, General, Council, CTD, Chairman, Members, General, Council"
"2875",2875,"46","46.     The Chairman underlined a few points which seemed to emerge from the meeting:         •       Given the evolving nature of electronic commerce, policymakers as well as                 businesses were continuously confronted with new challenges as well as                 opportunities;         •       E-commerce could contribute to the greater and more effective participation of                 developing countries in world trade. There had been a few success stories in this                 regard. However, as one speaker pointed out, only 2 per cent of the world population                 was currently on-line. Many developing countries had capacity constraints which                 prevented them from participating actively in electronic commerce.         •       A number of international organizations were providing technical assistance towards                 enhancing the participation of developing countries in electronic commerce and were                 addressing legal and regulatory issues arising from the spread of electronic                 commerce. It was crucial that their efforts worked in the same direction and were                 better coordinated.

"2874",2874,"45","45.      The Chairman recalled that, following a period of uncertainty, the General Council had agreed on 17 July 2000 to reinvigorate the work programme on electronic commerce on a practical basis. This was understood to be without prejudice to any delegation's position on the status of the 1998 Declaration (WT/MIN(98)/DEC/2). The CTD was among four subsidiary bodies invited to pick up their work on e-commerce within their respective spheres of competence, identify cross-sectoral issues, and report back to the General Council at its regular meeting in December 2000. At its 30th Session, the CTD agreed to organize an informal meeting of the CTD jointly with Geneva Week to obtain briefings from various agencies to help formulate the CTD's report to the General Council. During this informal meeting, representatives of UNCTAD, ITC, ITU, and WIPO made presentations on their work on electronic commerce, and the CTD also heard from Secretariat staff on WTO's work in this field. There had been some limited time to discuss some concerns and questions raised by Members.","WTCOMTDM31.pdf","Chairman, General, Council, CTD, General, Council, CTD, CTD, Geneva, Week, CTD, General, Council, UNCTAD, ITC, ITU, WIPO, CTD, Secretariat, WTO, Members"

He said that a specific proposal had been made on the establishment of a work programme. He said that while there was as yet no agreement on the establishment of a work programme, there was however, widespread agreement that work should continue, and the precise nature of such work would need to be the subject of consultations. He proposed that such consultations be carried out, and that the CTD revert to the matter at a subsequent meeting.","WTCOMTDM31.pdf","Chairman, chairman, CTD"

She said that during the course of the debate a number of delegations had pointed to the need for clarity on a number of aspects relating to small economies, and this was one justification for further WT/COMTD/M/31 Page 8 work on the issue. Her delegation joined that of Mauritius in stating that there were factors other than trade which contributed to vulnerability, but that the trade dimension aggravated the problems faced by small economies.","WTCOMTDM31.pdf","Jamaica, Mauritius"

He said that the participation of non-residents had been a positive feature. His delegation supported the proposal by the delegation of Barbados concerning the elaboration of a work programme on small economies. He said that as far as his delegation was concerned, there was no confusion, as it was clear that there were small economies in the WTO, and that there was a need for special and differential treatment in favour of these economies in order to strengthen their participation in international trade. He said it was not possible to have the same type of rules for all economies, and added that the list of factors cited by the Chairman in his report contributed to the identification of small economies. He said that in addition to these factors, it was necessary to take into account the fact that a number of economies were subjected to blockades or embargoes, which were unjustified and which caused a degree of vulnerability which beyond those faced by other economies. He said that Cuba was an example of a country which suffered from such vulnerability. He said in addition that the majority of various proposals made on implementation would lead to a better integration of small economies into the world trading system, and hence that swift decisions needed to be taken with respect to paragraphs 21 and 22 of the draft Seattle Ministerial text.","WTCOMTDM31.pdf","Cuba, Barbados, WTO, Chairman, Cuba, Seattle"
"2866",2866,"38","38.      The representative of Saint Lucia said that the seminar had been well attended, despite it being held on a Saturday. He said the Chairman's report was useful, though there were some areas that could be augmented. He recalled, and agreed with, a statement that had been made that the understanding of problems and difficulties constraining development was an evolving science. He said that in the 1950's, all countries had been treated similarly. Subsequently, there had arisen an appreciation that there was a distinction to be made between developed and developing countries. Still more recently, a differentiation had been made between developing countries and least-developed countries. There was still a need to examine whether there were any further disadvantages faced by countries. What had come out of the seminar was that there was clearly a perception that countries which had been identified because of their peculiar and unique disadvantages had not been able to benefit from globalisation and new market opportunities. He said that the issue was not one of defining a special category for these countries. Rather, what needed to be done, since there was a recognition that there could be particular problems facing those countries, was to address the issues that arose. If there could be any practical outcome from the Seminar, it would be the undertaking of a rigorous and authoritative analysis of problems facing these countries. While it was true that UNCTAD was carrying out work in this area, it was also necessary for the WTO to decide as to whether it was going to simply tag on to the UNCTAD's work, or undertake it own work. His delegation was of the view that it was more appropriate, given the very specific mandate of the WTO, that such work be undertaken by the WTO.","WTCOMTDM31.pdf","Saint, Lucia, Chairman, UNCTAD, WTO, UNCTAD, WTO, WTO"

The representative of Chile said that his delegation shared the view of the representative of Bolivia who had alluded to the confusion which had been created during the seminar as the discussion switched between the question of small economies and small states. He said that at various points in the discussion, Chile could consider itself as falling within the small economies group, and at other times outside. He said that his delegation had a fundamental concern about the emergence of new groups the composition of which was not clearly established.

"2861",2861,"33","33.     The representative of the European Communities said that the holding of the seminar showed that the WTO was responsive to the concerns of its Members. His delegation was pleased that regional cooperation was a major topic that had come through in the seminar. Regional trade agreements and the pooling of resources in the regions could be a major help, and that there was value in cooperation with larger trading partners. Second, his delegation recognised that there was a problem in participating in Geneva-based work, and added that this was a generic problem that went beyond the question of small economies. Third, regarding the specific contribution the WTO could make to the discussion on small economies, his delegation noted the mention made in the Chairman's report of stable and predictable market access and of an issue-by-issue approach to specific problems and constraints. There was a problem if there was no definition of small economies, since if market access was to be granted, it was necessary to know to whom. Similarly, in order to pursue an issue by issue approach, some ground-work needed to be done in order to define which countries concerned. Self-selection was not the answer, given that both rules and benefits derived from them were under consideration, and it was necessary that the benefits be fully understood by those who provided them and took advantage of them.","WTCOMTDM31.pdf","European, Communities, WTO, Members, WTO, Chairman"

The representative of Mauritius said that the seminar had the merit of being successful, and had the enhanced benefit of participation from developed countries and international organisations. WT/COMTD/M/31 Page 6 His delegation was of the view that the Chairman's report considered a number of useful topics for reflection. He said that by highlighting matters of priority, the report set the parameters for future work. Responding to the comments made by the United States, he said that he shared the view that trade was not a cause of vulnerability, and added that the true concern remained the impact of vulnerability on participation in international trade. He said this concern should be taken into account in any future work. He highlighted the importance of macroeconomic management. He also requested that future work should take into account questions such as: How was it possible to take advantage of technological developments? How was it possible to take care of those determinants that were not so fundamental to competitiveness? How was it possible to harness electronic commerce, financial services, and tourism for the benefits of small economies? How could international endeavours could bring comfort in further helping small economies? How could small economies pool together their resources and take advantage of cooperation? He said that the report had given the right tone, and that there were indeed parameters for a broad agenda. He said that the approach taken should be a holistic one, tying in trade with other dimensions. How, for example, could technical assistance and capacity building programmes be articulated and implemented to meet the needs of small economies? He concluded by saying that his delegation's approach was on an issue-by-issue basis.","WTCOMTDM31.pdf","Mauritius, Chairman, United, States"
"2859",2859,"31","31.      The Chairman, responding to the comments made by the United States, recalled that the speaker from the World Bank had indicated that the study he refered to was still in process, and hence that the statement on trade not being a cause of vulnerability lacked an element of definiteness.","WTCOMTDM31.pdf","Chairman, United, States, World, Bank"
"2858",2858,"30","30.      The representative of the United States said her delegation benefitted from the seminar on small economies, and was impressed by the range of views expressed. She said that while there might have been a low turn out from developed countries, there were a very large number of developing countries present, especially in view of the presence of non-resident WTO members. She said that her delegation noted that there had been a lack of clarity on what constituted a small economy: there had been a number of references to small and vulnerable economies; to small, vulnerable and volatile economies; and to small, vulnerable and isolated economies. From the point of view of their advocates, each of these concepts presented serious issues for consideration, as these concepts expressed the particular nature of their economies' problems. While the United States had serious concerns about the lack of definitional clarity, there were a number of presentations made which suggested that countries considering themselves to be small economies could organise themselves in a way to identify and target arguments or views under the rubric of special and differential treatment in the context of existing WTO agreements. If this were to happen, it would better enable developed countries to target their special and differential treatment responses. She said that the United States could not, however, support a category in the WTO, especially in the light of the confusion expressed by some Members considering themselves to be small economies. She said that the WTO already recognised the needs of least-developed countries – most of which were in Africa – and the needs of developing countries. She recalled the point made by some participants at the seminar that the least-developed countries belonged to a defined category while developing countries considered themselves to be developing countries on the basis of self-definition, and said that while some developing countries were self-selecting, it did not follow that developed countries viewed such countries as developing countries in the context of WTO rules and benefits. The United States could not, at this time, endorse a Work Programme on small economies, but welcomed the interventions of countries considering themselves to be small economies, in order to allow Members to understand more clearly what was being targeted in the WTO. Her delegation reiterated that much of the discussion in the seminar was very substantive, and clearly noted the direction of countries to articulate and concretise particular problems so that they might be understood in the context of the special and differential treatment exercise and the work of the CTD. Referring to the Chairman's statement, she said that one thing that appeared to be missing were statements made by participants to the effect that trade was not the cause of vulnerability, but rather that financial flows were more of a problem. The inclusion of such a statement would have presented a more balanced picture. She referred to the sentence in the report which began ""while openness to trade may exacerbate vulnerability…"", which as it stood gave the impression that there was no comment made that trade did not cause vulnerability. She said that in making this point, her delegation still recognised that there clearly were issues of vulnerability and serious problems to be dealt with in trade matters.","WTCOMTDM31.pdf","United, States, WTO, United, States, WTO, United, States, WTO, Members, WTO, Africa, WTO, United, States, Members, WTO, CTD, Chairman"

The representative of Guatemala said that the theme of small economies was an important one, adding that the WTO was lagging in its work on the question when compared to other international organisations and regional fora. His delegation was of the view that the seminar would be helpful in bringing solutions to a number of difficulties which confronted small economies. His delegation was concerned about two matters: first, the change of date to a Saturday. His delegation had believed that the practice of holding seminars on weekdays would have been continued, and the                                                                                    WT/COMTD/M/31                                                                                            Page 5 change of date to a Saturday had a significant impact, given that this deterred a number of delegations from taking part, which was reflected in the attendance. Secondly, his delegation was of the view that the seminar had generated some confusion, rather than clarity, regarding the concept of small economies, given that a substantial part of the discussion had revolved around the definition of small states. While small states and small economies shared many characteristics, the two concepts were distinct. His delegation supported future work on small economies in the WTO, including through the elaboration of a work programme. His delegation supported the views expressed by Barbados regarding the inclusion of UNCTAD in work on small economies. He was of the opinion that, while the UNCTAD had indeed carried out much work on small economies, it was necessary to keep the work of both organisations distinct.","WTCOMTDM31.pdf","Guatemala, WTO, WTO, Barbados, UNCTAD, UNCTAD"

He said that the objective had been to discuss the interests of Members who had small economies, and to seek solutions to problems faced by these countries, within the multilateral trading system. He said that there had been confusion arising from the fact that the theme of small economies had been presented as a question of small states. He also drew attention to the fact that the date of the seminar had been changed, and that it had been held on a Saturday. His delegation was of the view that the seminar had not reached its desired objectives, had generated confusion and had frustrated the expectations of Members interested in the question. His delegation hoped that future activities on the question of small economies would be organised in consultation with small economies, and was ready to support any initiative in favour of small economies.","WTCOMTDM31.pdf","Bolivia, Members, Members"
"2854",2854,"27","27.      The representative of Barbados said that the seminar had covered a range of issues of importance to small economies. Her delegation found that the range of issues, which included characteristics, constraints, vulnerabilities, and policy approaches – domestic and international - made for a discussion that led to a deeper and further understanding of issues related to small economies. She said that many participants had stated that in the trade-related field, there were several measures and mechanisms that could address the problems, constraints and needs of small economies. Her delegation held the view that the case had been amply made for the launching of a work programme on small economies. Such a programme could serve an exploratory function which could allow all Members to examine issues closely, as well as an opportunity to formulate prescriptions as to the way forward, in order to address the needs and constraints of small economies. Her delegations joined other in calling upon the Secretariat to set in place a work progamme on small economies. She said that she acknowledged that the report was on the Chairman's own responsibility, but was struck by the reference to the need to resolve civil conflicts. Her delegation held the view that the focus of work in the WTO should remain on trade issues. Finally, regarding the fora in which work on small economies could be taken up, she said that while the UNCTAD played a very important complementary role to the WTO, there was a need for substantive work on multilateral rules to be undertaken in the WTO, adding that the WTO would be one of the last organisations to address the issue of small economies.","WTCOMTDM31.pdf","Barbados, Members, Secretariat, Chairman, WTO, UNCTAD, WTO, WTO, WTO"

The documentation provided was also useful, and was a source for reference for the future. She said that the seminar clearly demonstrated that while small economies shared some problems with other developing economies, they also faced peculiar problems which arose from the very fact of being small economies. She said that the solution called for some measure of differential treatment, possibly on an issue-by-issue basis, for resolving the problems of small economies and to ensure that they had a greater level of participation in the world trading system. She said that some of the other points raised included: cooperation at a regional level, which was something that Caribbean countries had been pursuing assiduously, the need for a higher degree of technical assistance from the WTO Secretariat, and other types of assistance which went beyond the scope of the WTO.","WTCOMTDM31.pdf","Trinidad, and, Tobago, Caribbean, WTO, Secretariat, WTO"

A report on the seminar prepared under the Chairman's own authority had been circulated to Members (see Annex). The Chairman said that there had been some very interesting presentations by experts from other international organizations and by academics. The CTD was also privileged to hear from a number of the representatives of small economies who were here for Geneva Week, as well as representatives from the Geneva community of Members. The seminar cast light on the problems of small economies, looking at their development indicators, including the issue of measuring vulnerability. It looked at the constraints on the small economies in trying to develop and diversify their trade, and in trying to negotiate on a number of fronts simultaneously. It also posed questions as to how the small economies could cope better, including through regional cooperation. Finally, it examined how the WTO and other institutions might respond. The seminar showed that there were some very real problems facing the small economies. Some of the solutions were in their own hands, but it was also the view that the international community could contribute to the solution of their problems. There was also a specific proposal for further work on the issue in the WTO.

The purpose of the seminar was to allow a frank exchange of views on the issue and to provide an input into the Committee's consideration of the question. (The seminar was also considered to be part of the ""Geneva Week"" for non-resident Members and Observers of the WTO.)       The seminar addressed two basic questions: the nature of the problems facing small economies and the possible solutions to those problems.          There was a broad measure of agreement that pursuing the question of definition was of limited value, but some participants felt that self-definition would be appropriate.                The methodological and other difficulties surrounding the computing of indices of vulnerability was also noted. It was widely agreed that it was more important to focus on the problems and possible solutions. As to the sources of vulnerability, small economies were characterised by a number of factors, some of which were inter-related. These include: (i) the limited size of their domestic market, reducing the scope for exploitation of economies of scale; (ii) the limited diversification of their export structure, both in relation to the range of products and concentration on a few markets; (iii) vulnerability to external and exogenous shocks, including natural disasters, and a limited adjustment capacity to these shocks; (iv) remoteness from markets and transport costs; (v) limited human resources and other factor endowments; (vi) shortfalls in institutional and administrative capacity.         While openness to trade may sometimes exacerbate vulnerability, such openness also afforded the opportunity to develop global industries, beyond the limited local market, and could also be a motor for growth and development.          There was broad agreement that internal reforms and policy measures were critical in addressing the problems of the small economies and in determining their participation in international trade and the global economy. Such reforms and measures included sound macroeconomic management. At a microeconomic level, it was important that small economies take advantage of technological developments, and that they target production to areas of comparative advantage, including those where economies of scale were not a fundamental determinant of competitiveness. E-commerce, tourism, financial services were cited as examples. Diversification of production and trade, while desirable, was difficult to achieve as it often required a significant amount of investment and training, and larger economies often seemed more attractive to foreign investors because of the size of their home markets. Flexible labour market policies, domestically and regionally, could also be important, alongside other measures, to address supply side bottlenecks.         However, there was broad support for the view that internal reforms and policy measures needed to be complemented by international endeavours. For example, the exports of the small economies often faced high tariff rates and non-tariff barriers in foreign markets. There was a need for enhanced, secure and predictable market access for exports of interest to small and vulnerable economies. WT/COMTD/M/31 Page 28          Participants felt that regional cooperation among small economies could help them overcome certain difficulties through the pooling together of their resources, including in international trade negotiations, at the bilateral, regional and multilateral levels. However, there was also a view that regional organizations could not fully represent all the interests of member states. The possibility of establishing regional trade agreements to expand market opportunities and to allow for a wider production base was supported by a number of participants, but others pointed out that, even working together, their combined size was still much less than other countries.         In relation to multilateral rules, participants suggested that an issue-by-issue approach might be taken in assessing how to respond to the constraints faced by small economies. Among the possible mechanisms that might be used were asymmetrical transition periods, flexibility provisions and adjustment mechanisms, none of which were new to the WTO.         A number of participants felt that the difficulties in terms of financial and human resources faced by small economies in making use of the Dispute Settlement Mechanism needed to be addressed as a matter of priority, through the provision of appropriate technical and financial assistance.          Representatives of small economies highlighted the great difficulties they confronted in fully participating in the work of the WTO. Some did not have the resources to maintain a mission in Geneva, but capacity constraints in capitals were also a problem. It was therefore necessary to establish mechanisms through which participation and representation could be enhanced. In this context participants also emphasised the need for adequate technical assistance, and in this respect the importance of funding the delivery of WTO technical cooperation on a secure and predictable basis.          During the seminar, it was mentioned that there were a number of regional initiatives being undertaken at present to strengthen the participation of the small economies in the WTO, for example, through the establishment of regional representation by the Pacific Forum countries and EC support for ACP representation. It was noted that there were communities of interests between small economies, LDCs and larger developing countries on many trade issues – such as greater market access or contingent trade remedies – that could be explored and built upon in the context of multilateral negotiations and through greater networking. On the other hand, there was also a view that there were limits to regional cooperation, and nothing could fully substitute for representation in Geneva.          Some participants called for the establishment of a work programme to look at the specific problems and needs of small and vulnerable economies. In the first stage, this might take the form of analysis of the trade of small economies, the extent to which they had benefited from provisions for special and differential treatment and the main obstacles to the provision of such treatment. A second stage might attempt to establish prescriptions to overcome these problems and the means for their implementation. One participant suggested that such work could be undertaken jointly by the WTO Secretariat with the collaboration of other agencies, as appropriate.          Finally, addressing the problems of small economies clearly requires a comprehensive and coherent approach that extends beyond the trade field. In particular, integrated initiatives are required to address the supply side bottlenecks that constrain the participation of small economies in the global economy. In this respect, a number of international organizations present during the seminar outlined their technical assistance and capacity building programmes which could be of special interest to small and vulnerable economies, and two developed Members gave an indication of programmes that could also be of assistance.                                               __________","WTCOMTDM31.pdf","Chairman, CTD, Chairman, Committee, WTO, Committee, on, Trade, and, Development, Committee, Members, WTO, WTO, WTO, Geneva, WTO, WTO, EC, ACP, LDCs, Geneva, WTO, Secretariat, Members"

The observer from UNCTAD drew the attention of the CTD to the UNCTAD work programme on the GSP, which involved compiling information and raising awareness on the GSP schemes, and monitoring improvements to the GSP schemes – including in the post-Uruguay Round WT/COMTD/M/31 Page 24 setting. He said that a newsletter was available on the UNCTAD web-site which reported changes to GSP schemes made by preference donors. In the course of 2001, the UNCTAD would be undertaking a number of studies evaluating the impact of GSP schemes on preference-receiving countries. He recalled that at the CTD Seminar on Special and Differential Treatment held in March 2000, the UNCTAD had made a short presentation on the GSP and on the impact of these schemes on preference recipients. The UNCTAD had a database on the GSP, and if WTO Secretariat so wished, the UNCTAD could cooperate in providing information.","WTCOMTDM31.pdf","UNCTAD, CTD, UNCTAD, GSP, GSP, GSP, UNCTAD, GSP, UNCTAD, GSP, UNCTAD, GSP, UNCTAD, GSP, WTO, Secretariat, UNCTAD"

This was reinforced by the statement made by the representative of the European Communities; the panel findings in question had been officially made known shortly after the document had been finalised. He said there clearly was a ""moving target"" aspect to the issue, and that a number of requests and suggestions had been made. There had been requests to present the up-side and down-side of aspects of special and differential treatment, and in that respect the Secretariat was in the hands of the Membership. The document reflected what had factually become known, and comments made, in various committees, which perhaps explained why the document recorded certain views and not others. He noted that there had been requests for information on GSP programmes, and it remained to be seen in what context this could be done. One possibility was to look at the use of GSP in the context of the paper on the participation on international trade, and it was not clear to what extent information on preferences was currently available or reflected the current situation. In terms of updating WT/COMTD/W/77, he said that a discussion of a Secretariat working paper on special and differential treatment had been incorporated in the draft work programme for 2001, for the autumn 2001 meeting of the CTD, so there was scope for at least one update.","WTCOMTDM31.pdf","Director, Development, Division, Secretariat, GSP, GSP, Secretariat, CTD"

In these circumstance, it seemed that the CTD was not yet in a position to grant ad hoc Observer Status to any of the three requesting organisations, and that further time was required for consideration of these requests, a position which was indeed the same as that at the end of the 30th Session. The Chairman therefore proposed that the agenda item be differed for further consideration.","WTCOMTDM31.pdf","Chairman, CTD, Chairman"

The representative of Mauritius said that the report was indeed voluminous, and his delegation was impressed by the statistics brought out regarding special and differential treatment, such as the fact that there were 145 special and differential treatment provisions, 107 adopted following the Uruguay Round, and 22 which applied to the LDCs. He said that the approach taken by the Secretariat was commendable since it identified the broad lines of special and differential treatment. He said that further time was needed to reflect on the document, though of course delegations such as his were reflecting on the subject of special and differential treatment all the time. He said his delegation remained to be impressed by some of the points identified in the document, such as: provisions aimed at increasing the trade opportunities of developing countries; provisions under which WTO Members would safeguard the interests of WTO developing country Members; flexibility of commitments, of action, and use of policy instruments; transition time periods; technical assistance; and provision relating to least-developed countries. Speaking in his own delegation's name, he said he wished to say that the African Group was seriously considering the document, and expected to come back with comments at the next session of the CTD.","WTCOMTDM31.pdf","Mauritius, Uruguay, Round, Secretariat, WTO, Members, WTO, Members, CTD"

There were discussions going on regarding some of these articles in the discussions on implementation – Article 66.2 of the TRIPs Agreement was one example – and he hoped that there would be regular updates on these discussions. He said that the document was also a useful basis for the discussions on special and differential treatment as such in the implementation debate. As a minor comment, he noted that panel findings were used in the document, and there had been a recent panel finding in relation to Article 15 of the Agreement on                                                                                      WT/COMTD/M/31                                                                                             Page 23 Anti-Dumping which could have been drawn upon; this also highlighted the importance of up-dating the document to ensure it reflected the state of play.","WTCOMTDM31.pdf","European, Communities"

The representative of Sri Lanka said that owing to time constraints, her delegation had not been in a position to consider the document in detail, and noted with satisfaction that this agenda item was tabled in the coming sessions of the CTD. She said that the document reflected most of the comments made by different Members of the WTO. She agreed with the United States that certain provisions had generated benefits to developing countries. In relation to the GSP, which had been in existence prior to the WTO, she asked whether the Secretariat was in a position to provide some sort of comparative study. Her delegation, along with others, was of the view that some of the benefits of the GSP had been eroded through trade liberalisation and after the WTO agreements had come into force. She did not know how such an exercise would fit into the discussion of special and differential treatment, but it was important to examine whether there had been an enhancement of benefits under the GSP, or whether these had been eroded.","WTCOMTDM31.pdf","Sri, Lanka, CTD, Members, WTO, United, States, GSP, WTO, Secretariat, GSP, WTO, GSP"
"2811",2811,"124","124.     The representative of the United States said that her government was in the process of a lengthy review with its various agencies. The Secretariat document (WT/COMTD/W/77) was very useful as it highlighted various provisions and the different agencies responsible for implementing the various provisions were being consulted. An inter-agency meeting was to be held, and she hoped her delegation would be in the position to make more detailed comments. As such, her delegation hoped that the CTD would carry over its discussion on the paper to future meetings of the CTD. She said that as a preliminary matter, the document did not always adequately describe the benefits developing countries were already receiving in some areas covered by the provisions discussed. For example, there were numerous statements criticising the GSP programmes, but there was no discussion of their benefits. Was one to assume that there were no benefits? Nor was there any data presented on the use of GSP programmes, nor on South-South trade between developing countries. There had been some comments made earlier on the discussion on market access for least-developed countries which were thought-provoking and possibly overlapped with some of the points made under this rubric. She said that the paper should also be modified to take into account the benefits developing countries were already receiving through technical assistance. In redrafting the document, the Secretariat could also take into account information on the participation of developing countries in international trade that was already being developed. She said that in regard to certain cases where there was connection between special and differential treatment provisions and technical assistance, there was already a major debate on technical assistance throughout the WTO. Her delegation wished for greater clarity on how the discussion of technical assistance would dovetail into discussions on special and differential treatment.","WTCOMTDM31.pdf","United, States, Secretariat, CTD, CTD, Secretariat, WTO"

"2805",2805,"119","119.     The Director of the Development Division apologised to delegations in view of the fact that the document had only recently been delivered. This was due in part to the fact that efforts had been taken to ensure that all concerned divisions in the house had checked the document to ensure it was as complete as possible. The pressure of work leading up to Geneva Week had also been a factor. The document was an update of previous work undertaken in the CTD (notably documents WT/COMTD/W/35 and WT/COMTD/W/66) and was pursuant to a request made by Members at the 29th Session of the CTD. He said the objective was to provide an overview of the implementation of the special and differential treatment provisions in the various WTO agreements and decisions. He said that in preparing the document, it had been possible to draw on the substantive information available and discussions held in the various WTO committees. The document also sought to examine to what extent it was possible to measure, either qualitatively or quantitatively, the implementation of various types of special and differential treatment. There were a number of instances where it was possible to measure the implementation of WTO agreements, and part of the information on this came through notifications, such as, for instance, under the Agreement on Agriculture, or information on technical assistance provided by Members. The paper had used a six-fold typology of special and differential treatment provisions, which had been first used for the 1999 High-Level Symposium on Trade and Development. The six types of special and differential treatment were specified in the document. Each of the sections in the paper which dealt with a particular agreement began with general comments, and then proceed to provide information on the special and differential treatment by type of provision found in the agreement in question. Information was presented in the form of a table, with one column giving the provision, and a second column, entitled ""Comment"" which showed how the different types of special and differential treatment provision had been used and also contained references to the sources of information. He said that section C of the paper contained a table which showed the number of special and differential treatment provisions by agreement and by type of special and differential treatment provisions.","WTCOMTDM31.pdf","Director, Development, Division, Geneva, Week, CTD, Members, CTD, WTO, WTO, WTO, Members"

It was emphasised that clear planning, prioritisation and vision were necessary for the effective allocation of resources. The Secretariat should not act simply on the basis of demands but should filter demands through prioritisation, planning and full consultation with Members concerning the mix of activities and budgetary constraints. It was stated that even if technical cooperation activities were funded on-budget, there would still be a balance to be found between budgetary and extra-budgetary funds.","WTCOMTDM30.pdf","Stoler, Secretariat, Members"
"2773",2773,"98","98.      Mr Stoler observed that although technical cooperation was a demand-driven activity, a certain distillation of requests received from developing countries for the year 2000 needed to be carried out to determine what could reasonably be expected in the light of resource constraints. For this purpose, a number of criteria and priorities needed to be established; (i) activities which were similar, both by country and by issue, to what had already been done in 1999 should be eliminated where possible; ii) requests for which there was little or no further information should be discounted; iii) requests which were duplicative, or that could be folded into other activities, should be combined; iv) if national priorities could be addressed in the framework of regional activities, this should be done; v) requests where host governments could probably provide the financing or at least cost- sharing should be identified; and vi) where the number of WTO officials engaged in an activity could be reduced, this should be done. Priority should be given to activities with LDCs; activities to assist most recent Members and countries and territories in the process of accession; and issues related to immediate implementation and current negotiations in agriculture and services.","WTCOMTDM30.pdf","Stoler, WTO, Members"

Mr Stoler, introducing the topic, emphasised the serious human and financial resource constraints faced by the Secretariat in the area of technical cooperation, as well as the need to bring the financing of technical cooperation on budget. This would bring greater predictability and consistency to the WTO technical cooperation programme, and enable it to respond positively to requests for assistance. Furthermore, it would have the effect of spreading the financial burden in a more equitable manner and providing adequate resources both for training and for technical                                                                                    WT/COMTD/M/30                                                                                           Page 19 cooperation.

In this regard, an adequate and continuous flow of information had to be encouraged among intergovernmental agencies involved in trade-related technical assistance.

With regard to technical cooperation in general, five ""disconnects"" were identified: ownership (with different ministries in Members being responsible for finance, trade and development); transparency of dissemination of information at the national level; information sharing on training taking place in different ministries of countries; information on what other international organizations do at regional and other levels; and the need for adequately trained human resources to undertake negotiations. The need was also expressed to have the specific provisions on technical assistance in various Agreements (SPS, TBT, TRIPS, etc…) fully operationalized.

"2759",2759,"85","85.     Three levels of coordination of technical cooperation activities were identified: within the Secretariat, at the national level, and with other international and regional organizations. In this connection, the view was expressed that WTO technical cooperation should be limited to what the organization can do best. It was observed by the Secretariat that programming of technical cooperation activities was extremely difficult when only 40 per cent of developing countries                                                                                    WT/COMTD/M/30                                                                                           Page 17 responded to the WTO questionnaire on their needs for technical assistance for the forthcoming year and when 90 percent of activities were financed through voluntary contributions.","WTCOMTDM30.pdf","Secretariat, WTO, Secretariat, WTO"

While Members' immediate needs in fulfilling obligations and taking advantage of trading opportunities could be a starting-point, a multi-year programme based on a logical sequencing of activities should be the main focus for the construction of a clear strategy. Follow-up action and assessment criteria should also be identified at the programming stage.

"2754",2754,"80","80.     Some speakers said that there was a wide asymmetry between the expectations of most developing countries and the existing framework of WTO's technical cooperation, based on the existing aim ""to assist in the full integration of beneficiaries into the multilateral trading system and contribute to the expansion of their trade"". No mention was made of investment and of the needs of developing countries in both supply and demand sides of the equation.

By contrast, it was noted that the relatively more developed and integrated developing countries had somewhat different needs, including a deeper understanding of WTO rules and disciplines; of detailed negotiating techniques in agriculture and services; and the creation of capabilities to address problems of implementation.

A number of participants pointed out that, for developing countries, especially least- developed countries, the building-up of supply capacity was a key element in trade-related development.

The Chairman brought before Members the suggestion that it would be useful if the essence of this three-day meting could be presented here in the WTO. He proposed that a half-day event be organised some time in November. The event would feature presentations by participants at the Montreux conference, and would include representatives of the ITC and representatives of the private sector.

He said that it would be better to consider the draft first, and then consider what further input would be made. Besides that, he was in agreement that the process to be followed should be that followed for the Rio Conference.","WTCOMTDM30.pdf","European, Communities, CTD"
"2738",2738,"66","66.      The Chairman recalled that the UN had structured the preparatory process for the High Level Event through the establishment of six working groups: Systemic Issues; Domestic Financial Resources; FDI and other private flows; International Financial Cooperation, ODA and Debt; and Trade. The UN had also initiated a process of holding regional consultative meetings, the first one having been held in Jakarta in early August for the Asia-Pacific region. The objective was that the work of the working groups was to contribute to the final declaration to be adopted in May 2001 at the High Level Event. In the context of these preparations, the involvement of the WTO had to date followed two tracks. First, the WTO secretariat had been invited to take part in the work of the working group on systemic issues, on FDI and other private flows, and on trade. The working group on systemic issues had its first meeting on 25 July 2000 in Tarrytown, New York, and aimed to complete its work by November of this year. Regarding the working group on trade issues, the WTO Secretariat had been invited to make a written input in the form of an analytical paper. Secondly the Preparatory Committee had a strong wish that the WTO make a written input of a political nature. As this input was to be from the WTO's Membership, it was important that the matter be taken up to establish how the CTD shall proceed. The following possibilities suggested themselves: (i) that the CTD await the completion of the Secretariat paper, and hold a discussion on its content. The report would then be forwarded to the Preparatory Committee, with a covering letter in which the Chairman would summarise the views expressed by Members. (ii) Alternatively, that the CTD ask the Secretariat to make a compilation of points made by Members in discussions on the Secretariat paper, and on the question of Financing for Development in general, and attach this compilation to the Secretariat paper, and forward these to the Preparatory Committee.","WTCOMTDM30.pdf","Chairman, UN, Domestic, Financial, Resources, International, Financial, Cooperation, ODA, UN, Jakarta, Asia-Pacific, WTO, WTO, Tarrytown, New, York, WTO, Secretariat, Preparatory, Committee, WTO, WTO, CTD, CTD, Secretariat, Preparatory, Committee, Chairman, Members, CTD, Secretariat, Members, Secretariat, Secretariat, Preparatory, Committee"

The Chairman recalled that at the 29th Session of the CTD, he had mentioned that the CTD may be required to contribute to the WTO input to the UN High Level Event on Financing for Development, to be held in 2001, but that this would depend on the outcome of the General Council to be held on 17 July. At that meeting of the General Council, Ambassador Bryn, the Chairman, recalled that on 19 May 2000, an informal meeting with Members of the UN Preparatory Committee for the High-Level Event on Financing for Development, Heads of Delegations of WTO Members and Senior Officials of the WTO Secretariat, had been held in order to hear from the Bureau of the UN Preparatory Committee proposals for a closer dialogue and cooperation with the WTO for the preparation of the High-Level Event scheduled for May 2001. Ambassador Bryn also mentioned that the Secretariat was already involved in two of the preparatory working groups, on trade and on systemic issues. Given the strong wish of the Preparatory Committee of the High-Level Event to receive a political input from the WTO membership, Ambassador Bryn proposed that the contact point for such an input be the CTD and that its Chairman be in contact with the Preparatory Committee. This proposal was accepted by the General Council. The Chairman recalled that it was also agreed that issues which might be raised in the context of the preparations for the High-Level Event would be discussed in the CTD. He recalled that a similar procedure had been followed in preparing a GATT contribution to the 1992 United Nations Conference on Environment and Development (UNCED) in Rio de Janeiro. That contribution was based on an input from the Secretariat and discussions among Members in the appropriate Committee, and it was agreed that the Chairman of the General Council would inform the Co-Chairs of the UN Preparatory Committee accordingly.

He said that the interest of developing countries in the subject of electronic commerce was further made manifest by the fact that the forthcoming Heads of Government Meeting of the G-15 had as its theme Information Technology and Telecommunications, with development questions as a fundamental perspective, including those questions relating to human resources and the development of competitiveness, which were brought under the collective heading of ""e-development"".","WTCOMTDM30.pdf","Venezuela, Members, UNCTAD, Electronic, Commerce, Okinawa, United, States, Japan, Information, Technology, and, Telecommunications"

The representative of Pakistan agreed that, whatever was being done as part of the reinvigoration of the work programme, was without prejudice to the status of the 1998 Declaration. He said his delegation could go along with the basic parameters set out by the Chairman, and was willing to participate meaningfully in any work undertaken, as the outcome of work conducted in the CTD was of paramount importance in terms of the ultimate analysis of e-commerce and the work of the CTD covered areas of importance to developing countries such as technical and financial assistance and fiscal issues. His delegation had taken note of proposals for a symposium and was of the view that February was too early for organising such an event, as it would be better to await the outcome of work conducted in the CTD and the other three subsidiary bodies. Regarding fiscal issues, and more specifically the unofficial study undertaken by the Secretariat in 1999, his delegation was of the view that this study should be circulated to Members, perhaps in the form of a non-paper, so that it could become a basis for discussion. Finally, his delegation requested that advance notice be given of the holding of informal discussion, and requested the Secretariat to prepare a short synoptic note on the discussion of electronic commerce held in the CTD prior to July 1999.

His delegation could also support the proposal in favour of holding a symposium on electronic commerce. He said that in view of the increasing importance of electronic commerce, the development of electronic commerce presented great opportunities for all WTO Members, in particular developing countries, and all businesses, including small and medium-size enterprises. In this context, the examination of electronic commerce issues in the CTD should take place. His delegation was of the view that issues related to electronic- commerce included cross-cutting issues, in particular, issues relating to financial and economic development issues; and to technical cooperation and capacity-building issues. His delegation was firmly in support of setting up a horizontal task force with the participation of capital-based experts, as this was the most appropriate forum for addressing cross-cutting issues. His delegation requested that the Chairman's report should state that electronic commerce related issues should be further examined as expeditiously as possible, especially from the point of view development. His delegation also requested that the Chairman report to the General Council state that many Members supported the establishment of a horizontal task force.","WTCOMTDM30.pdf","Japan, General, Council, WTO, Members, CTD, Chairman, Chairman, General, Council, Members"

The representative of the United States said that her delegation could support the suggestions made by the Chairman, and said that it would be very beneficial to hear from other institutions. She said that e-commerce had become a very significant feature on the development side. She said that with respect to the questions raised earlier on revenue, there was an unofficial Secretariat study which was undertaken in 1999 on revenue issues. She said that the Secretariat could assist interested WT/COMTD/M/30 Page 12 Members in identifying where they could locate the study. She said that, with reference to the ITC Executive Forum, the ITC web-site for the event identified several policy-related questions which Members were seized upon in the WTO. She suggested that if the work programme were to proceed in accordance with the General Council decision in December, that the CTD could consider holding a symposium with the participation of developing country entrepreneurs, to update information provided in the seminar on electronic commerce of 1999 organised by the CTD. She said that at the informal session, it would be useful to distribute information on the initiative launched at the G-8 Okinawa Summit, which aimed at building capacity in developing countries in order to level the playing field in e-commerce. The initiative brought together the G-8 countries in their commitment to build capacity for e-commerce in developing countries in a number of areas, including infrastructure and training. Furthermore, private sector companies had signed on to the initiative and announced their intention to work with developing country partners. She said that since the 1998 Declaration on E-Commerce had indicated the relevance of the impact of e-commerce on developing country financial and economic interests, and that there had been a lot done since 1998. Her delegation hoped that once direction had been given by the General Council, Members could address some of the initiatives on capacity-building, and that the CTD could benefit from case studies and examples that have resulted from various initiatives. She pointed to the United States initiative to connect Sub- Saharan African countries, which was a US$15 million initiative over a five-year term. The United States also had an ""Internet for Development"" initiative which included pilot countries, a list of which was increasing and which included Egypt, Uganda, Guatemala and various others. Her delegation would expand on these initiatives in the future.

"2728",2728,"57","57.      The Chairman drew the attention of Members to different possibilities regarding the organisation of the work of the CTD on electronic commerce for the rest of the year. He recalled that the General Council had asked the CTD to report at the December meeting of the General Council. At the same time, the CTD planned to have one more formal session, during which it would need to hold whatever discussions Members desired to have on the subject and finalise the report. Given this situation, he said Members might feel it necessary to have informal consultations, in order to facilitate the finalisation of the report presented to the General Council. The schedule of meetings was extremely crowded for the month of October, which created logistical problems for both Members and the Secretariat. However, he drew the attention of Members to the fact that during the Geneva Week for non-residents, a briefing session was planned on electronic commerce, for the afternoon of the 25th of October. Speakers at this session included WTO Secretariat staff as well as staff from the ITU, ITC, and UNCTAD. The Chairman proposed that the CTD could make use of this opportunity and enlarge this particular session of the Geneva Week into an informal CTD consultation on electronic commerce. This would have a number of benefits: it would enable the CTD to have informal consultations in a context where logistical difficulties may have hampered the organisation of such consultation; the CTD could draw on the planned presence of experts from other IGOs; and the CTD would also receive the input of non-residents into a component of the CTD's work programme, which was in keeping with the desire of the Membership to increase the effective participation of all members in the work of the WTO. The overall the goal of the informal consultations was to facilitate the finalisation of the CTD's report to the General Council.","WTCOMTDM30.pdf","Chairman, Members, CTD, General, Council, CTD, General, Council, CTD, Members, Members, General, Council, Members, Secretariat, Members, WTO, Secretariat, ITU, ITC, UNCTAD, Chairman, CTD, CTD, CTD, CTD, CTD, WTO, CTD, General, Council"
"2727",2727,"56","56.      The Chairman recalled that, following a period of uncertainty, the General Council agreed on 17 July 2000 to reinvigorate the work programme on electronic commerce on a practical basis. This was understood to be without prejudice to any delegation's position on the status of the 1998 Declaration (WT/MIN(98)/DEC/2). Four subsidiary bodies, including the CTD, were invited to pick up their work on e-commerce within their respective spheres of competence, identify cross-sectoral issues, and report back to the General Council at its regular meeting in December 2000. He recalled, the work programme on e-commerce adopted in September 1998 had called on the CTD to ""examine and report on the development implications of electronic commerce, taking into account the economic, financial and development needs of developing countries"" (WT/L/274). Since then a number of delegations had made submissions and comments on the issue and the Secretariat issued a ""Note on the Development Dimension of E-commerce"" (WT/COMTD/W/51) and also organized a seminar on electronic commerce and development. (The report on the seminar is available in document WT/COMTD/18.) A final report on the contribution of the CTD to the work programme was presented to the General Council in July 1999 (WT/COMTD/19). He said that in the report of the CTD, a number of questions that might be further explored were listed. These included, for example: What were the infrastructure and human resources developments required to address the needs of developing countries in e-commerce? What kind of technical assistance could be provided by the WTO? What were some of the innovative solutions and success stories in developing countries that others could learn from? What impact was e-commerce likely to have on customs revenue in developing countries? How significant were the duties on particular products traded electronically in specific countries?","WTCOMTDM30.pdf","Chairman, General, Council, CTD, General, Council, CTD, Secretariat, CTD, General, Council, CTD, WTO"

The Chairman proposed that CTD take note of information provided by the EC and Canada, urge the expeditious implementation of proposals, and encourage other major trading partners to take similar action to improve market access for LDCs.

The representative of Zambia thanked the EC and Canada for the information they had communicated, and encouraged other trading partners to take similar steps in the near future. He recalled the Director-General's appeal to major trading partners to open their markets more fully to the exports of LDCs, and to provide more technical assistance. He said that such measures were a top priority. He said that in addition to tariff and non-tariff barriers, supply-side issues should also be an element of market access discussions. His delegation thought that an approach focused uniquely on market access without paying due attention to supply-side constraints was incomplete, as many constraints continued to impede exports. He said that the WTO needed to play a vital role in exploring export possibilities and opportunities for LDCs, and should encourage other relevant organisations to address their supply-side constraints.","WTCOMTDM30.pdf","Zambia, EC, Canada, Director-General, WTO"
"2723",2723,"52","52.      The representative of Uganda expressed the appreciation of his delegation to the EC for the proposal by the Commission on unrestricted market access for LDCs. His delegation also welcomed the statement made by Canada. He said he hoped these measures would facilitate diversification. He said that a discussion of how to take advantage of such increased access opportunities through capacity-building was important. He encouraged trading partners to continue providing increased access through preference schemes, without bringing in extraneous issues.","WTCOMTDM30.pdf","Uganda, EC, Commission, Canada"
"2722",2722,"51","51.      The representative of Canada informed the CTD that as of 1 September 2000, Canada had increased the number of products that could enter duty-free from LDCs. She said Canada had eliminated duties on imports from LDCs on an additional 570 tariff lines, as a result of which LDC exporters were eligible for duty-free treatment on 90 per cent of all tariff lines, up from 82 per cent. She said that to further improve opportunities for LDC exporters, Canada had further liberalised the origin requirements that applied to imports from LDCs.","WTCOMTDM30.pdf","Canada, CTD, Canada, Canada, Canada"
"2721",2721,"50","50.      The European Communities said that his delegation could make available, as an informal document, details of the initiative. He said that the Commission had proposed that all remaining imports from LDCs which were not subject to unrestricted market access (excluding arms) be granted such access, with phase-in periods on sensitive products such as bananas, sugar and rice. The outcome of the debate among EU member-States was awaited. He recalled that the EC already absorbed 56 percent of LDC exports, which made it the largest importer of LDC products, and his delegation hoped that this announcement would inject more momentum to the discussion of such initiatives amongst other trading partners, and lead to improved market access conditions for LDCs.","WTCOMTDM30.pdf","Commission, EU, EC"

The Chairman proposed that under ""Other Business"" the CTD consider a proposal that a briefing session be held on the outcome of an ITC Forum on National Export Strategies, held at Montreux from 27 to 29 September 2000, the theme of which ""Export Development in the Digital Economy"".","WTCOMTDM30.pdf","Chairman, CTD, ITC, Montreux"

The representative of Bangladesh brought to the attention of the CTD the fact that the European Commission had recommended to its Member states that unrestricted market access be extended to all exports of LDCs, with the exclusion of arms. He said that the LDCs had been arguing in favour of such an initiative, and that therefore the EC's proposal was welcome. He proposed that the CTD take note of this initiative, and that it encourage that the proposal be finalised. He asked that the CTD call on other OECD Members, especially the United States, Canada and Japan, to take similar steps.","WTCOMTDM30.pdf","Bangladesh, CTD, European, Commission, Member, LDCs, EC, CTD, CTD, OECD, Members, United, States, Canada, Japan"
"2718",2718,"48","48.     The Chairman recalled that at the 29th Session of the CTD, he had mentioned the statement by the Director-General at the 3 May General Council meeting regarding provision of information on market access for exports originating in least-developed countries, and had indicated that he wished to take up an issue of procedure. Normally, notifications and information provided on changes to GSP were sent to the CTD under the provisions of the Enabling Clause and it was assumed, therefore, that information on any actions taken by Members under their GSP schemes in favour of LDCs would also be provided in this way. On the other hand, steps taken under the 1999 Waiver on Preferential Tariff WT/COMTD/M/30 Page 10 Treatment for LDCs were to be notified to the Council on Trade in Goods. The Chairman recalled that at the 29th Session, he had said that he would, with Members' permission, consult with the Chairman of the CTG on how to resolve this inconsistency, and then hold some informal consultations. However, because of the summer break it has not yet been possible for the Chairman to hold these consultations with the Chairperson of the Council for Trade in Goods. He hoped to be able to report back to the CTD at the next session. Advice was also to be sought from the WTO Legal Division on the matter.","WTCOMTDM30.pdf","Chairman, CTD, Director-General, GSP, CTD, Members, LDCs, Chairman, Members, Chairman, CTG, Chairman, Chairperson, Council, for, Trade, in, Goods, CTD, WTO, Legal, Division"

A decision to discuss further the issues arising in connection with technical cooperation, in 2001, could be taken at the discussion of the work programme for 2001 at the 31st Session of the CTD.","WTCOMTDM30.pdf","Chairman, CTD, CTD"
"2715",2715,"45","45.     The Director of the Technical Cooperation Division said that he was in full agreement with the representative of Norway that the implementation of monitoring and evaluation functions should be done on a gradual basis. He said that, given available resources, this was the only approach could be envisioned over the coming years, adding that it was a wise approach that would allow lessons to be drawn. Referring to the question from the Philippines, he said that the Strategy paper contained a section on evaluation and follow up. He said that as a result of suggestions made at the 29th Session of the CTD, the questionnaires had been revised to include a section on objectives. These revised questionnaires were to be annexed to the draft Strategy paper circulated in November. He said that the Technical Cooperation Division was prepared to make available on a more frequent basis information on activities undertaken, their costs and purposes. He said that discussions were underway with the Secretariat Working Group on LDCs so that the same database could be used, and discussions were underway with the Finance and General Services Division (FGSD), so that financial figures which appeared were the official figures of the FGSD.","WTCOMTDM30.pdf","Director, Technical, Cooperation, Division, Norway, Philippines, CTD, Technical, Cooperation, Division, Secretariat, Working, Group, on, LDCs, General, Services, Division"
"2714",2714,"44","44.      The representative of the United States said that the Secretariat report called for the evaluation of WTO programmes on a geographic and thematic basis which made it possible to collect lessons applicable as widely as possible to activities across more than one country. He said that such information would be systematically disseminated to the Secretariat, beneficiary countries, and donors countries, and that therefore the United States supported the concept. He said that his delegation was happy to note that the proposal incorporated both external and internal evaluation. His delegation also had specific comments and questions concerning the report. First, he noted that the evaluation questionnaires did not ask participants what their objectives were, and said that it was important to collect information on, inter alia, the objectives of participants. He asked whether, in the process of planning the activity, there was a process for written agreement between the Secretariat and the beneficiary on the needs to which the assistance provided was designed to address, and the objectives of the assistance. His delegation believed that such a process was vital, not only to the delivery of the assistance, but also for the evaluation of its delivery and its effectiveness. He said that the process of reporting back to the CTD in a format that conveyed useful information was also important, and his delegation wished to hear the Secretariat's thinking in this regard. He also asked that if the information was stored in the technical assistance data-base, whether it would be possible for the Secretariat to report back to members on a more frequent basis.","WTCOMTDM30.pdf","United, States, Secretariat, WTO, Secretariat, United, States, Secretariat, CTD, Secretariat, Secretariat"
"2713",2713,"43","43.     The representative of the Philippines said that his delegation shared Norway's appreciation of the Secretariat's efforts in producing the draft Strategy paper. He suggested that issues of monitoring and evaluation could be discussed later in the context of the overall strategy. He said that the draft strategy could be placed for the consideration of beneficiaries, who would ensure that donors would be responsible enough to meet in a more effective way donor concerns regarding resource allocation. His delegation shared the view that the delivery of technical assistance was the responsibility of                                                                                      WT/COMTD/M/30                                                                                              Page 9 donors, and beneficiaries were responsible to ensure that they benefitted from technical assistance in a useful way.","WTCOMTDM30.pdf","Philippines, Norway, Secretariat"
"2712",2712,"42","42.      The representative of Norway thanked the Secretariat for the preparation of the document on a strategy for technical assistance. His delegation was of the view that such a document would be very useful as a point of departure for the evaluation of WTO technical assistance. His delegation were particularly interested as to how the Secretariat would spell out the niche that the WTO would occupy in the delivery of technical assistance, and how the WTO could cooperate with other agencies, without making such cooperation an added burden. His delegation welcomed proposals by Switzerland on how to tackle ad hoc requests for technical assistance. He said that in a number of cases, speedy action was needed on the part of beneficiary countries. On the other hand, a situation where ad hoc processes became dominant was one to be avoided. Specifically regarding documents WT/COMTD/W/73 and WT/COMTD/W/74, his delegation had sought expert advice. Their experts were of the view that the Secretariat approach disclosed a highly professional approach to monitoring as well as evaluation, and that the set-up was ""state of the art"". However, the experts warned against an approach in monitoring and evaluation that was too ambitious in relation to the realities at hand. While it may be useful to draw on UNDP and OECD models, these also had dimensions that were different from those which applied to the WTO. Norway advised the CTD to allow the Secretariat to implement its strategy progressively over a period of years. This was a pioneering activity in uncharted territory. Concerning monitoring and evaluation reports, his delegation noted that the Secretariat adopted a very positive attitude as they did not seek to point to errors or blame any party. While his delegation favoured a constructive attitude, it was also of the view that the Secretariat needed to be frank in assessing experiences, for its own benefit and that of the CTD, so that the CTD could be familiarised with both successes and failures. He said that much attention had been given to the Secretariat's role and its capacity to fill that role. However, its success in this depended on commitments made by other parties, namely donors and recipients. Regarding donors, his delegation had stressed the importance of integrating technical assistance fully into the regular WTO budget. No less important was follow-up of and feedback from recipients. Donors needed to know how their monies had been spent, and one aspect of long-term financing was the assessment of the recipients themselves on how the assistance had functioned, and its effects. His delegation recommended in future that the opportunity be given to recipients to express their assessment and advice.","WTCOMTDM30.pdf","Norway, Secretariat, WTO, Secretariat, WTO, WTO, Switzerland, Secretariat, UNDP, OECD, WTO, Norway, CTD, Secretariat, Secretariat, Secretariat, CTD, CTD, Secretariat, WTO"
"2711",2711,"41","41.     The Chairman recalled that at the its 29th Session held on 28 June the CTD began an extensive discussion on technical assistance issues, which was continued on 10 July. However, some Members indicated that they wished to revert to the consideration of two Secretariat documents: The Framework      for    Monitoring      and     Evaluating     the    WTO      Technical   Cooperation Activities (WT/COMTD/W/73) and Monitoring and Evaluation of the WTO's Technical Cooperation Activities – Manual for WTO's Secretariat Staff dealing with Technical Cooperation Activities (WT/COMTD/W/74). During the previous meeting, Members had raised a number of questions on the reports, and clarifications were given by the Secretariat. Members also made a number of suggestions for improvement in the reporting process in order to facilitate the monitoring of the WTO's technical cooperation activities. The Chairman said that the Secretariat was going to take these comments on board","WTCOMTDM30.pdf","Chairman, Members, Secretariat, WTO, Technical, Cooperation, Activities, WTO, WTO, Secretariat, Staff, Members, Secretariat, Members, WTO, Chairman, Secretariat"

"2708",2708,"39","39.      The Director of the Technical Cooperation Division said that, in respect of least-developed countries, a separate Secretariat Working Group had been established. Regarding the transfer of the Integrated Framework's administrative unit from the ITC to the WTO, he said that this had been done to improve the administration of the IF, given that the person responsible for chairing the Inter- Agency Working Group was part of the WTO Secretariat. He said that other questions raised by Haiti could be addressed at the meeting of the Sub-Committee on LDCs. Regarding the relationship of the private sector to the development of technical assistance, he said that the question had not arisen from the point of view of funding, but rather from the perspective that the private sector was the engine of growth. Since this was the case, the view had been expressed that attendance by representatives of the private sector during WTO technical assistance activities would be beneficial. There was no intention that the WTO take over the mandate of the ITC. Regarding the need to consolidate the various ideas and proposals that had been expressed on the subject of technical assistance, the Director of the Technical Cooperation Division brought to the attention of the CTD a document that had been prepared by the Technical Cooperation Division, and circulated two days prior to the 30th Session, which was entitled ""A Strategy for Technical Assistance in the WTO"". The intention was to table the document at the 31st Session of the CTD. The document took into account all existing documents that had been prepared on technical cooperation since the establishment of the WTO, all the suggestions made at the ""Days of Reflection""; the chairman's report; and the recommendations of the two task- forces on technical assistance which had been set up over the previous two years. The document was structured into seven different sections. He said that the document was still far from complete, but constituted a first step. It provided in one single document coverage of many of the issues and elements raised by Members, and hopefully would assist Members in their deliberations on technical assistance. Regarding the question of the budget for 2001, he said that there was a section on technical assistance. There was paper which summarised a presentation given by Deputy Director-General Mr. A. Stoler. The text contained two tables, one outlining the fact that out of the 10 milion requested for 2001, some SwF2.5 million would relate to additional human resources, that is about 16 new positions across the whole of the WTO secretariat. A second table depicted what would be done with the other SwF7.5 million. The matrix was organised by subject and modes of delivery, and it covered developing countries and least-developed country members.","WTCOMTDM30.pdf","Director, Technical, Cooperation, Division, Secretariat, Working, Group, Integrated, Framework, ITC, WTO, Inter, -, Agency, Working, Group, WTO, Secretariat, Haiti, WTO, WTO, ITC, Director, Technical, Cooperation, Division, CTD, Technical, Cooperation, Division, WTO, CTD, WTO, chairman, Members, Members, Director-General, A., Stoler, WTO"

The representative of Haiti proposed that in order to develop concrete solutions to questions relating to the financing of projects under the Integrated Framework, the WTO should take up with the World Bank the idea that a quarter of resources generated by debt relief should be allocated to the funding of trade-related projects coming under the Integrated Framework. He said that this was a concrete area where the collaboration between the WTO and the World Bank could be effective.","WTCOMTDM30.pdf","Haiti, WTO, World, Bank, Integrated, Framework, WTO, World, Bank"
"2706",2706,"37","37.     The representative of the Philippines said his delegation appreciated the value of the ""Days of Reflection"" and the report submitted by the Chairman, insofar as it covered issues of the management of technical cooperation. He said that the delivery of WTO technical assistance related to general development-oriented technical assistance provided by other agencies. He said that the value of the ""Days of Reflection"" would be determined by how the discussion of technical cooperation could be moved forward. He said that in moving the process forward, it was necessary to take into account the view of donors, beneficiaries, and the Secretariat. He said that a framework should be developed by                                                                                    WT/COMTD/M/30                                                                                            Page 7 the WTO Secretariat on how the programme of management could be worked out and consulted with the donors and beneficiaries. He said that he was unaware of any set of guidelines on how the technical cooperation programme worked, and what were the main and subsidiary objectives; and whether technical cooperation was accessible to all and on what criteria. He said that following the establishment of the WTO, there was huge demand for technical cooperation which had perhaps been unanticipated. It was on the basis of reflections that the WTO could craft certain guidelines on technical cooperation. He said that it was recognised that WTO operated in a wider setting, and, as had been demonstrated in discussions on the Integrated Framework, there as an increasing emphasis on mainstreaming trade policies into overall development strategies, including those related to poverty reduction. This was another paradigm which needed to be taken into account, and for which specific resources may need to be devoted. He said that there was a specific issue concerning collaboration with NGOs and the sharing of expenses, and there had been some positive experiences from both the ITC's and the UNCTAD's activities in this respect. He said that it was necessary for the WTO to consider all these issues and develop a common approach.","WTCOMTDM30.pdf","Philippines, Chairman, WTO, Secretariat, WTO, Secretariat, WTO, WTO, WTO, Integrated, Framework, ITC, UNCTAD, WTO"
"2705",2705,"36","36.      The representative of Haiti recalled that his delegation had intervened on a number of the themes identified in the report. He said he wished to emphasise three areas: cooperation with other inter-governmental agencies; technical cooperation in favour of least-developed countries; and the question of human resource requirements and the financial implications of such requirements. Regarding the question of cooperation with other inter-governmental agencies on matters of technical cooperation, his delegation had made concrete suggestions to the effect that Memoranda of Understanding (MoUs) signed between the WTO and various other inter-governmental organisations could have concrete results for the delivery of technical cooperation activities by the WTO. For instance, he had suggested that the conclusion of the MoU between the WTO and the UNIDO could be speeded up, so that there might be cooperation on matters related to industrial development. Referring to the ITC, and the mandate that the WTO had for close collaboration with this organisation, his delegation expressed surprise at what appeared to be, in the context of the implementation of the Integrated Framework, a reduction of the scope of cooperation with the ITC. He said that the ITC had been responsible for the Administrative Unit of the IF, which was now being handed over the WTO. He raised questions about this transfer of responsibilities, in view of the fact that there was already too much for the WTO to handle. With respect to the issue of technical cooperation in favour of least-developed countries, and the Integrated Framework, he recalled that his delegation had already expressed the concern that by anchoring technical cooperation in the activities of other agencies that the Integrated Framework was losing the focus of its mission, which was to address the trade-related concerns of least-developed countries. He said that linkages were being made between trade-related technical cooperation, and the UNDP's poverty reduction framework, and also with the World Bank's mission regarding poverty and development. While his delegation believed that particular attention needed to be given to poverty reduction, the IF was a complementary exercise, which was intended to focus on trade-related problems, and not social problems. If the IF was too closely attached to other poverty reduction programmes, then the IF as had been mandated by the Singapore Ministerial Conference would be diluted. Regarding human resource and financial resource needs, he said that the quest for core budgetary funding of technical cooperation had been on-going for two years. He said that prior to the Seattle Ministerial Conference, the proposal had been to stagger an amount of SwF10 million over a three-year period, whereas now it was proposed that the sum be provided over one year. In relation to the latter proposal, he noted that it had also been proposed that 75 per cent of this sum be devoted funding activities, while 25 per cent be devoted to human resources. His delegation requested clarification of what was meant by ""activities"". His delegation was also of the view that each Member should contribute towards the funds.","WTCOMTDM30.pdf","Haiti, MoUs, WTO, WTO, WTO, UNIDO, ITC, WTO, ITC, ITC, WTO, WTO, Integrated, Framework, Integrated, Framework, UNDP, World, Bank, Singapore, Ministerial, Conference, Seattle, Ministerial, Conference, Member"

In order that a more complete picture of the topics and issues for discussion that came out of the ""Days of Reflection"" be given, her delegation thought it important that account be taken of a specific proposal that had been made by her delegation, and endorsed by others, during the ""Days of Reflection"" to the effect that consideration should be given to the provision of funds to enable experts from capitals to attend meetings in Geneva in order to provide support for missions in Geneva that lacked adequate capacity. Such actions would ensure better implementation of agreements and a better compliance with commitments.","WTCOMTDM30.pdf","Colombia, Chairman, Geneva, Geneva"
"2703",2703,"34","34.       The representative of the European Communities said that the Chairman had compiled in a clear and factual manner the proceedings of the ""Days of Reflection"". He said that the issues under discussion were complex, as evidenced by the number of points raised in the Chairman's report, which ranged from matters of budget, to matters of planning, to matters of scope and so forth. His delegation agreed with the issues identified by the Chairman, in the introductory section of his note, as being the most urgent ones. His delegation believed that the time had come to see how the report could be built on, given the clearer view that Members now had on the issues at stake. He said that discussions on technical assistance were not only advancing in the CTD, but elsewhere as well. He said that one of the tasks of the CTD would be to synthesise the common elements of the various discussions which were taking place. For instance, the TBT Committee had discussed what approach it could take to technical assistance, and the EC had also submitted its own proposal to the Committee on Customs Valuation. There was also an extensive discussion on the Integrated Framework, which also addressed questions such as funding, planning and scope, as well as the concept of ""mainstreaming"". He said that there was also a debate in the context of APEC, as well as the initiatives taken by donors at a bilateral level. Finally, he noted that the Director-General had sent out a questionnaire on these issues as well. He said that discussions should reflect these various initiatives, and that conclusions should be drawn on this basis. He said that Switzerland had made a concrete proposal regarding the planning of technical assistance activities, and that this was one way to start a concrete discussion. Another way to start concrete discussion was to be aware of the various discussions that were on-going, notably those surrounding the Integrated Framework, which were in many ways the leading discussions on technical assistance and which covered many areas of relevance to the delivery of technical assistance in general. He said that there had been proposals made to the effect that the principles of the Integrated Framework be extended to technical assistance in general in the WTO. He said that a general strategy based on all these points was an important WT/COMTD/M/30 Page 6 demand, though it was not clear who was in a position to write such a strategy. His main concern was that the various approaches pursued be pulled together, so that their essence may be distilled.","WTCOMTDM30.pdf","European, Communities, Chairman, Chairman, Chairman, Members, CTD, CTD, TBT, Committee, EC, Committee, on, Customs, Valuation, Integrated, Framework, APEC, Director-General, Switzerland, WTO"

A compendium had been compiled of all technical assistance provided, a copy of which was to be distributed to the WTO, and the information contained therein was also accessible through the World Wide Web, at http://www.usaid.gov/. The compendium compiled information on technical assistance provided each region and the financial resources involved. She urged Members to consult the compendium, as this could be used to identify problems, and also possibilities for the use of technical assistance. She said that the question had once been raised in the CTD as to why the United States did not devote the resources it had been providing bi-laterally to fund technical assistance through the WTO. She said that while comments made in CTD meetings on the role of the Secretariat in the delivery of technical assistance were important, bi- lateral technical assistance was a fact of life, and had been taking place prior to, and independently of, the WTO's establishment and the GATT. She said that it was important for Members to coordinate the technical assistance they received from various sources, and that if there was a comprehensive approach to the use of technical assistance, the results would also be comprehensive. She said that the compendium was an example of how the United States coordinated its efforts in the delivery of technical assistance, and hoped that there would be similar efforts in coordination on the beneficiary side, so that the results of technical cooperation could be better realised. She said that the United States was to submit a contribution of SwF1 million to the Global Trust Fund, specifically for the Africa region, as a start, and that this money would cover WTO technical assistance for both least-developed countries and other developing African countries. The United States and the WTO Secretariat had evaluated how the funds would be utilised, and it was expected that a second contribution would be made in 2001 for other developing countries. She said that technical assistance provided by WTO experts was effective, and that the funds required for the delivery of such assistance would be available, but the United States was concerned that, irrespective of the source of technical assistance, there be better coordination on the donor, the WTO and the beneficiary sides, in order that the results of technical assistance delivery be optimal.","WTCOMTDM30.pdf","United, States, Secretariat, United, States, WTO, Members, CTD, United, States, WTO, Secretariat, WTO, GATT, Members, United, States, United, States, Global, Trust, Fund, Africa, WTO, United, States, WTO, Secretariat, WTO, United, States, WTO"
"2700",2700,"31","31.      The representative of Switzerland said the ""Days of Reflection"" had been quite useful, and that the Chairman's report adequately summarised the proceedings of the event. He said that it was necessary to work out a clear strategy in the months to come, with a clear definition of objectives, and a logical sequencing of technical assistance activities. This was, however, unlikely to solve another major problem in the delivery of technical assistance activities: as the Chairman's report pointed out, it was difficult to programme technical cooperation activities when only a minority of beneficiary countries responded to the planning questionnaires. He said that the ad hoc nature of technical assistance delivery was not primarily a problem of the WTO Secretariat, since the Secretariat was not necessarily in a position to reject an ad hoc request by a country official. Therefore, Switzerland was of the view that the CTD should give support to the Secretariat, by enabling it to take measures which would make the three-year plan a more reliable planning instrument. He said that there were several possibilities which could be envisioned to facilitate the programming of technical assistance activities an the early announcement of technical assistance needs. For instance, one possibility – which could be called a ""soft option"" – would be to name those countries which made extensive use of ad hoc requests. Another possibility was that the CTD should take a decision that the Secretariat should only accept requests which were made in due time, that is, in the autumn of the year preceeding the delivery of the activity. This would be a ""hard option"", but had the advantage of sensitising everyone to the fact that technical assistance had long-term effects, and that it needed to be carefully planned by beneficiary countries. A third possibility, which would build-in some flexibility to deal with urgent, ad hoc, requests would be to specify that ad hoc requests were not excluded per se, but that they would be only accepted on condition that the requesting country partially participate in the financing of the activity. Switzerland proposed that the Secretariat be mandated, as part of its current work on assessing and redefining technical assistance, to develop proposals on measures to reduce ad hoc requests, and therefore to make the three-year plan a more reliable instrument","WTCOMTDM30.pdf","Switzerland, Chairman, Chairman, WTO, Secretariat, Secretariat, Switzerland, CTD, Secretariat, CTD, Secretariat, Switzerland, Secretariat"

Like other LDCs, Bangladesh looked forward to more enhanced levels of technical cooperation. His delegation generally supported what had been said by the representative of Norway, particularly the need to place the funding of WTO technical cooperation on a firm footing through the regular budget. He said that another point of the report that had attracted his delegation's attention was the need for priority for technical assistance programmes for LDCs. Regarding the role of the Integrated Framework (IF), he said that Bangladesh was disappointed by the fact that the IF had not performed as well as expected. He added that the IF, hamstrung as it was, was being saddled with extra responsibilities. It seemed to be becoming a coordination mechanism of sorts, and there was also the additional, and not fully understood, issue of integrating the IF into the PRSP process. He felt that the IF should be left as it was conceived to be.","WTCOMTDM30.pdf","Bangladesh, Bangladesh, Norway, WTO, Bangladesh"

"2697",2697,"29","29.      The representative of Norway welcomed the Chairman's report on the ""Days of Reflection"", which was a useful summary of the themes raised. Norway clearly agreed with several points in the report, such as the need for a clear strategy for technical cooperation in the WTO; the need to reduce dependence on ad hoc initiatives; and the need to address the serious underfunding of WTO technical cooperation. His delegation reminded the CTD of Norway's strong conviction that the WTO's technical assistance activities should be made part of the regular WTO budget, while not precluding voluntary contributions. The inclusion of the financing of these activities on the regular budget was necessary to ensure the stable and predictable funding base of the Secretariat's planning of technical assistance. More information was needed on what was meant in concrete terms by the reference to the need to involve the private sector. Was this a reference to possible private funding of WTO         1             See Annex, pp.16-20. WT/COMTD/M/30 Page 4 technical assistance activities, or was it a reference to the role private actors such as academia and NGOs could play in technical assistance programmes at the national level? His delegation sounded a word of caution regarding the role of the WTO in technical cooperation. As Norway saw it, this role was clearly linked to submitting information, building capacity, and providing training concerning the various rights and obligations that existed in the WTO Agreements. Norway did not foresee a role for the WTO in technical assistance activities of a more general, developmental nature. Such activities were to be left to other organisations such as the World Bank, the IMF, the UNDP, and the UNCTAD, as well as bilateral donors. The WTO's technical cooperation activities needed to be coordinated with those of other partners, and trade-related technical assistance needed to be better integrated into general development projects and programmes.","WTCOMTDM30.pdf","Norway, Chairman, Norway, WTO, WTO, CTD, Norway, WTO, WTO, Secretariat, WTO, WTO, Norway, WTO, Norway, WTO, World, Bank, IMF, UNDP, UNCTAD, WTO"

He said his report1 on that meeting, prepared on his own responsibility, had already been distributed and copies were also available in the room in all three languages (see Annex). His general impression was that the Days of Reflection had served as a useful exercise to distil ideas on the WTO's role in technical cooperation. Among the issues on which he thought Members would want to continue to reflect were: how best to balance planning needs against urgent demands; how to balance demands against budget and personnel constraints; what should be the substantive content of the seminars; how best to deliver technical cooperation on the one hand, through regional or national and, on the other hand, through specialised or more general seminars; how best to collaborate with other international and national agencies; and how the success of WTO technical cooperation function on an ongoing basis might effectively be monitored, and how ideas for improvement could be taken up.","WTCOMTDM30.pdf","Chairman, CTD, WTO, Members, WTO"

As Chairman, I have deduced from the discussion during the two Days of Reflection a clear recognition of the link between trade-related technical assistance, trade and development, and of technical assistance as a core function of the WTO. The discussions have also led me to reflect on whether WTO technical assistance should not perhaps logically have two foci: a narrower focus on providing information on and promoting implementation of the WTO Agreements, and a related role in support of broader trade and development strategy, in which WTO's technical cooperation should, as appropriate, be coordinated with and reinforce development assistance provided by other organizations and institutions within their areas of competence, as well as in some cases by bilateral donors. These two elements seem to me to pervade the discussion of objectives, ways and means, and disposal and use of resources for technical cooperation and, it seems to me, should be a basis for the discussion of strategy and modalities for the WTO's technical cooperation in the future.","WTCOMTDM30.pdf","Chairman, WTO, WTO, WTO, WTO, WTO"

He was of the view that given the importance the WTO attaches to notification obligations as exemplified by the establishment of a Working Group on Notification Obligations and Procedures, the Committee should devote some time to reviewing the notification requirements of the texts it had been given responsibility for - i.e. Article XVIII:A, C and D, Part IV, and the Enabling Clause.

On the subject of observership, he recalled that this matter was still outstanding in the General Council, and that the Committee had been deciding at each meeting which organizations it would invite for its next meeting. The Chairman informed the Committee that in August 1995, he received a letter from the Director-General of UNIDO requesting observer status in the Committee, and that he had asked the Secretariat to reply that a definitive response could not be given as the issue of observership was being considered by the General Council. However, in light of the interim procedures under which the Committee on Trade and Development was working, he invited comments on whether UNIDO could be invited to the next meeting of the Committee on Trade and Development. In response to a question posed by the representative of the European Communities, the Chairman indicated that UNIDO did not have observer status in the GATT 1947 Committee on Trade and Development. In the absence of further comments and in light of the ad hoc procedures, he proposed that the Committee on Trade and Development agree to invite a representative of UNIDO to its Fourth Session as well as all the organizations that were invited to its Third Session.

However, a thorough consideration by the CTD would have been facilitated if all the reports had been available well in advance of the meeting. As a general comment, he stated that it would have been useful if the report had included an explicit reference to the strategy behind WTO's technical assistance activities, with objectives and priorities clearly stated. With this, the CTD would have been better able to undertake a comprehensive review of the 1999 report and to consider the different elements to which reference was made in the report.","WTCOMTDM29.pdf","Norway, CTD, WTO, CTD"

The representative of United States welcomed the improved organization and format of the reports and emphasized that the evaluation of the effectiveness of technical cooperation activities                                                                                    WT/COMTD/M/29                                                                                           Page 17 would be an important complement to the discussion of the reports. She emphasized the importance of coordination in technical assistance; recognizing that there could be some difficulty in internal coordination at the national level in countries receiving assistance, she also sought more information about coordination within the WTO Secretariat, particularly since a number of Divisions are involved; in particular, how technical cooperation was coordinated and whether there was a specific strategy for avoiding overlap and duplication of internal activities. She also reiterated the importance of coordination with other organizations. Noting that ITC had maximized outsourcing possibilities, she sought a better strategy for dealing with WTO's technical assistance. The United States had made suggestions in the Sub-Committee for Least-Developed Countries and the General Council in respect to improvements in technical cooperation and on the Integrated Framework. Her delegation would look very carefully at the review taking place and would comment on that, as it would be very significant for future technical cooperation activities. She also recognized the need also to be more informative about the bilateral technical assistance the United States and other donors were providing, and hoped that a better picture of the effective use of technical cooperation would emerge.","WTCOMTDM29.pdf","United, States, WTO, Secretariat, ITC, WTO, United, States, General, Council, United, States"

She would comment once full remarks were received from the Capital. Japan considered that developing countries fully recognized and were convinced that they can benefit from the multilateral trading system. Japan supported technical assistance to help the developing countries integrate better into the multilateral trading system and acknowledged the importance for WTO to coordinate its work with the bilateral donor countries and other international organizations that provide technical assistance in the field of trade, in particular World Bank, UNCTAD and ITC, to make it more efficient and effective.","WTCOMTDM29.pdf","Japan, Secretariat, Japan, Japan, WTO, World, Bank, UNCTAD, ITC"
"2645",2645,"96","96.      The representative of India said that his Government had participated in several activities organized by WTO or with other organizations. He felt that much more could be done in the field; the main problem was lack of manpower and funding to cope with the increased demand. If technical cooperation was to be effective, it should go beyond the present endeavour to organize workshops to explain the provisions of the agreements, and instead focus on the exchange of technology and scientific know-how to help developing countries better access the global markets and integrate themselves into the world economic order. He agreed with the parts of the report on Agriculture, SPS, and Services. For TBT he agreed that technical cooperation seminars should focus on assisting developing countries in meeting the requirements of standards, technical regulations and conformity assessment procedures in their main export markets. He also emphasized the need for help for developing countries to develop their human and institutional resources; and finally, he stated that support to regional coordination and cooperation in assistance to small and medium-size enterprises in developing countries to benefit fully from the WTO system were also necessary.","WTCOMTDM29.pdf","India, WTO, Agriculture, SPS, TBT, WTO"
"2644",2644,"95","95.     The representative of the European Communities first announced that the Kingdom of Sweden had decided to give additional funding this year to the Global Trust Fund of SwF1.3 million or Skr7 million. He thanked the Secretariat for the report, which gave a good overview of what was being done in the field of technical assistance. Positive aspects were that the call for greater regional cooperation and for outsourcing of activities seemed to have been heard, at least through involving more organizations - although he noted in passing the WCO was not mentioned while WIPO and other regional organizations received attention. He encouraged the Secretariat to pursue this particular avenue as far as possible. Building on a question raised by Switzerland, he said that it was not a very good basis for a discussion with donor agencies to say that ""the number of activities has increased by 24 per cent"". Some of these activities might be very short, involving one official, while others may be very long involving several officials. It would be better to argue how human resources needs have risen, or how needs have been diminished by using outsourcing. He also asked why countries could not foresee their needs in advance, and why there was so much ""ad hocism"". If 48 per cent of planned activities could not take place, something was wrong. A more structured approach to technical assistance should be taken. Thirdly, he noted that the training packages developed by WTO should play a bigger role. Fuller use should be made of these and even more could be done. Lastly, regarding the funding and human resources, he asked whether activities that had not been carried out because of lack of funding could have been done if the money had been there, in other words, there were adequate human resources?","WTCOMTDM29.pdf","Kingdom, of, Sweden, Secretariat, WCO, WIPO, Secretariat, Switzerland, WTO"
"2643",2643,"94","94.      Turning to planning, he noted that 70 per cent of all activities carried out in the previous year did not have a reference in the three-year plan. On the one hand, this was a clear sign that the three-year plan, as a potentially useful working and planning instrument, was not yet where it should be. On the other hand, Members as demandeurs should take much of the blame because the WTO Secretariat was not necessarily in the position to reject ad hoc requests. In that context, he wondered whether the term ""demand-driven"" was not confused with the term ""ad hoc"". He was not convinced that it should be ""understandable"" that ""countries often cannot anticipate a specific need long in advance"". This might have been understandable in the first couple of years after the WTO came into WT/COMTD/M/29 Page 16 being; however, now it should be possible for Members to estimate their needs in advance and to organize technical assistance in a longer perspective. He suggested that the Secretariat could also do more against this ""ad hocism"", through a well-designed technical assistance programme with a longer and sustainable perspective. This would assure that assistance teams were not constantly called into countries on an ad hoc basis. By designing longer-term technical assistance programmes it would easier to reject ad hoc calls; in addition, such long-term programmes would certainly also yield longer lasting benefits than just ad hoc interventions.","WTCOMTDM29.pdf","Members, WTO, Secretariat, WTO, Members, Secretariat"
"2642",2642,"93","93.      Commenting on the report presented by Mr. Léger, he reported a criticism made previously that it was too much geared to a purely quantitative presentation. The value of this information may be interesting for statistics, but was of limited use for determining the value of technical assistance and for deciding future policy on technical assistance. On the other hand, he would have expected to find some indication in the report of the money spent while executing individual activities, i.e. some indication on where, in what areas, and on what activities the SwF6.05 million francs mentioned had been spent.","WTCOMTDM29.pdf","Léger"
"2641",2641,"92","92.      The representative of Switzerland first referred to the report's conclusion, once again, the financing basis for technical assistance was insufficient and not stable enough, due to the fact that no solution had yet been found with regard to using funds from the regular budget. Switzerland regretted this situation, believing firmly that strong support for technical assistance in the regular budget was necessary and for that reason it should be increased.","WTCOMTDM29.pdf","Switzerland, Switzerland"
"2640",2640,"91","91.      The representative of Egypt noted with approval a certain tendency to holding more national than regional seminars and more specialized ones rather than those of a general nature. Coupled with this issue was the relationship with the limited financial and human resources of the Secretariat. Some requests submitted to the Technical Cooperation Division for holding national seminars or specialized training courses were still pending, possibly due to lack of human or financial resources; while others were being addressed through regional or general seminars. The representative had doubt that regional or general seminars were very important and of very considerable benefit to some countries, but such seminars should take place among ""harmonized"" countries in terms of their levels of economic development, so that the exchange of views could be beneficial to all. Finally, the representative stressed that technical assistance was an educational process that should be done through the means identified by the requesting country, which was in the best position to know its needs.","WTCOMTDM29.pdf","Egypt, Secretariat, Technical, Cooperation, Division"
"2639",2639,"90","90.      Referring to the budget, Mr. Léger noted that money spent so far in 1999 (i.e. up to July) amounted to SwF6.05 million against projected expenditures of SwF10 million for the whole year. A large number of activities could not be carried out because of a shortfall in financing; human resources were also stretched to the limit. He recalled that five years ago the WTO conducted 79 missions, compared to 382 last year; the increase in human resources that the organization had received over the years for technical cooperation, not only in the Technical Cooperation Division, but in all divisions, was not commensurate with the increase in the number of activities.","WTCOMTDM29.pdf","Léger, WTO, Technical, Cooperation, Division"

"2637",2637,"89","89.   Mr. Léger referred to Annex 2 of the report identifying the activities held under the Integrated Framework and under JITAP, a joint programme with UNCTAD and ITC. In 1999, 67 missions were                                                                                      WT/COMTD/M/29                                                                                             Page 15 related to these two programmes. Regarding budgetary aspects, he noted that voluntary extra-budgetary contributions accounted for more than 90 per cent of funding, and stressed that this heavy dependence on voluntary contributions made it difficult to plan technical assistance. Thus increasing the regular budget for technical assistance remained a major priority. He also noted the shortage of human resources for technical assistance. This, he said, was a very urgent problem in view of the fact that more requests were being received from developing countries to assist them in the negotiations on agriculture and services. Finally, he said, one element that should not be forgotten was the process of continuous renewal of developing countries' administrations, with a steady stream of new government officials requiring training on WTO Agreements.","WTCOMTDM29.pdf","Léger, Integrated, Framework, UNCTAD, ITC, WTO"
"2636",2636,"88","88.     Mr. Léger noted that, in 1999, the largest number of activities took place in Africa with 106; the largest percentage increase, however, was in Latin America and the Caribbean, where 100 activities were undertaken. This was due in large part to WTO's collaboration with the Institute for the Integration of Latin America and the Caribbean, the training arm of the Inter-American Development Bank, and cooperation with the Organization of American States. Regarding mode of supply in 1999, WTO undertook more national seminars than regional seminars, indicating a tendency for subjects presented to be more narrowly focused. There was a sharp drop in regional seminars, from 71 to 51, and a sharp increase in symposia, workshops and training courses, from 106 in 1998 to 173 in 1999, again underlining the trend towards more specialized activities. Finally, in 1999 there was an increase in both general-type seminars and more focused technical missions, although the rate of increase was larger for more specialized types of missions.","WTCOMTDM29.pdf","Léger, Africa, Latin, America, Caribbean, WTO, Institute, for, the, Integration, of, Latin, America, Caribbean, Inter-American, Development, Bank, Organization, of, American, States, WTO"
"2635",2635,"87","87.      The Director of the Technical Cooperation Division, Mr. Léger, indicated that in 1999 the WTO carried out some 382 technical assistance activities, representing a 24 per cent increase over 1998. In 1999, such activities took place in 127 countries of which 100 were WTO Members, 20 countries and territories negotiating their accession to WTO, and seven were countries expressing an interest in joining WTO. The activities conducted in 1999 respected the guidelines for WTO technical cooperation issued by the CTD in October 1996, that is to say, the Secretariat followed a demand-driven-approach, ensured as much as possible a geographical balance among the different regions of the world, and also gave a priority to LDCs. However, regarding the number of activities identified as part of the three-year plan for the year 1999, only 52 per cent were actually carried out (79 missions). These in turn represented only 21 per cent of the total technical cooperation activities carried out in 1999. If the activities planned for 1998 that were in fact carried out in 1999 were added, the percentage increased from 21 to 30 per cent. Therefore, 70 per cent of all technical assistance activities carried out by the WTO in 1999 were not identified in the three-year plan. Concerning activities undertaken by WTO together with other international organizations, 41 per cent were fully organized by the WTO; an additional 23 per cent were organized jointly with another international organization; and invitations for WTO to conferences, seminars and workshops represented 36 per cent of activities conducted in 1999.","WTCOMTDM29.pdf","Director, Technical, Cooperation, Division, Léger, WTO, WTO, Members, WTO, WTO, WTO, CTD, Secretariat, WTO, WTO, WTO, WTO"

He said that some time needed to pass before there was information on the trends the CTD had been discussing. It would be useful to come back to this in the middle of next year when Members could can have a meaningful update of the Secretariat paper. Of course, if there were to be any important rapid developments, the option was also open to revert to the issue earlier. It was proposed that the next update of the paper could be planned for sometime in 2001.","WTCOMTDM29.pdf","Chairman, CTD, CTD, Members, Secretariat"
"2632",2632,"84","84.      The representative of Bolivia said that the document WT/COMTD/W/65 called for a serious reflection by Members regarding the multilateral trading system they had created, and on the responsibilities which lay with different Members. For the small and vulnerable economies, whose exports were dominated by raw materials and agricultural products, the slow – or absence of – liberalisation in the agricultural sector and the textiles and clothing sectors had retarded the development of these sectors. Slow reforms in areas of export interest to small and vulnerable economies meant that there persisted tariff structures which acted as a disincentive impeding a better diversification of products. She said that the ultimate results of fluctuations in trade shares or the lack of market access were opportunities lost forever; lives cut short; underprivileged children, and excessive urbanisation. She said that said that these considerations seriously affected rural and urban environments, and made it difficult to do anything about enhancing the welfare of animals, since it was difficult to explain to the populace why the welfare of animals should be given consideration before its own. She said that Bolivia had adopted structural adjustment programmes and trade liberalisation policies, and had made many sacrifices, in order to generate much-needed growth. However, Bolivia had not received as a counterpart to its efforts, the opening of markets which would have lead to an increase in exports, and had indeed experienced chronic balance of payment deficits, making policy openness unsustainable, and politically unacceptable to the population. She said that in WT/COMTD/M/29 Page 14 this era of globalisation, it was necessary that each player assume his responsibilities. She asked how one could justify the resistance to change and opening up of access opportunities in favour of those economies that most needed such opportunities, which, if seized, could enable small and vulnerable economies to move out of their present condition. It was necessary to ensure that small and vulnerable economies received sufficient export revenues, in order for them to sustain their reforms.","WTCOMTDM29.pdf","Bolivia, Members, Members, Bolivia, Bolivia"

"2621",2621,"74","74.      Following the general introduction, a second representative of the ITC said that she would take the Members on a guided tour through the more practical aspects of their work. The World Trade Net provided information, training and advice to the business community on the whole range of WTO related issues and aimed to facilitate the integration of business sector views into national trade negotiation strategies. Their main partners in the different networks were business associations. While the composition of network partners differed in every country, they included WTO focal points in different ministries, trade promotion officials, academia, consultants, lawyers, business trainers. WTO Reference Centers and regional institutions were also partners in the networks. All interested players were invited to join the network and were encouraged to interact, exchange information, and WT/COMTD/M/29 Page 12 cooperate among themselves. The basic condition for a country to participate in the World Trade Net was simply the active interest expressed by the public and the private sectors in that country. Considerations for extending the network included the potential for synergy affects with other ITC activities and with activities by other donors as well as the intention to create a geographically diverse network with member countries at different levels of development. The training and reference materials provided to all ITC members comprised practical training packs, business cases written by members based on their experiences and concerns in trying to adjust their business strategies to the changes in the multilateral trading system. ITC provided a service answering questions related to the changes concerning business operations emanating from the multilateral trading system. Last but not least, the web-site of the programme was an additional tool, not replacing the other tools, but helping to create another channel of better communication and access to information by network members. Using a power-point presentation, the representative of the ITC demonstrated the various features of the web-site. The web-site had been utilised to provide information about video-conferences, which had provided opportunities for network partners to comment on and update their knowledge about the on-going negotiations on the GATS and discuss developments in their respective countries. The up-coming video conference on the GATS and the export of services was organized in cooperation with the World Bank Distance Learning System and would be hosted in Bangkok, Thailand, with participation from Malaysia, Philippines and experts from Switzerland. Another one had already been hosted out of Sri Lanka with participation from Pakistan, Nepal, and Bangladesh. The ""what's new"" section of the web-site included a newsletter on developments in the WTO and was sent monthly to about 400 e-mail addresses. Overviews of the Business Guides were also available on the web-site, including a section on most frequently asked questions, which had been compiled during seminars with business representatives. The most important part of the web-site was the information about the networks and member countries, which allowed partners from different networks to interact, exchange information, and cooperate. The core of the World Trade Net Programme was the action plans and activities implemented by its members through the networks. ITC helped with those activities through kick-off meetings and joint-planning.

A representative of the ITC said that ITC's work on technical cooperation complemented that of the WTO in three different areas: policy and rule-making work, normative and research work, and technical assistance activities. The focus of ITC's technical cooperation was the business community and business support institutions, particularly SMEs in developing and transition economies, with special attention paid to those in LDCs. All activities were carried out in close consultation with the WTO's Technical Cooperation Division and other substantive divisions, be they field-based programs or preparation of business-guides or training and technical materials. ITC's value-added was its experience of over 35 years in providing technical assistance, its institutional competence, tools, techniques and skills for delivery as well as its combination of approaches which had been developed over the years. Broadly, the approach of the ITC involved needs assessments, using a mixture of global, regional, and country projects, concentrating on national capacity building, promoting partnerships and network building in the field, and making the fullest use of advanced technologies for delivering technical cooperation. In the area of the multilateral trading system, the programmes had three major objectives: improving the trade performance of the business sector, especially the SMEs; building national capacity so that the business community could benefit from the multilateral trading system; concentrating on enterprises, associations, Chambers of Commerce, the legal community; and facilitating and enriching the dialogue between the public and private sectors so as to incorporate effectively the views of the business community in shaping the multilateral trading system. ITC would present to the CTD more detail on some features of the World Trade Net, an important programme of ITC. Members were welcome to visit them at the ITC or virtually on the web-site to obtain more information. The World Trade Net was only one example of an entire range of activities covered by ITC's various programmes, including the Integrated Framework and JITAP, where the WTO was a joint-implementer. ITC had a large number of country programmes as well as sector and function specific programmes, covering areas such as services, SPS, TBT, public procurement, apparels, textiles and clothing among others. The genesis of the World Trade Net programme had been the 1996-1999 Uruguay Round Follow-up Programme, which had been centered around a Business Guide to the Uruguay Round. The Guide was an easy to read publication, published in English, French, and Spanish, explaining the Uruguay Round Agreements. Some countries had also taken the initiative to translate it into other languages. The Guide had been disseminated through 160 seminars in over 70 countries. The rich experience gained, thanks to feedback and questions from the business community and government counterparts, had paved the way for the ITC to plan and prepare for the World Trade Net Programme. Broadly, the output of the programme was easy-to-read business guides: the new Business Guide to the World Trading System, copies of which were available outside the meeting room, and the Business Guide to the GATS. It also included training materials, including for training the trainers. A web-site and web-based services had been developed, which would be the focus of a more detailed presentation that day. All material of the World Trade Net, most of which was available in English, French and Spanish, was accessible for all members of the ITC, whether they were Members of the WTO or not. At the moment, the web-site was only in English, but the French and Spanish versions would be ready by the end of the year. In addition, there were some full members of the World Trade Net, which were the motivated and committed partners receiving additional assistance in the field under the programme. At present, 15 countries were full members and 12 were waiting to be incorporated into the programme. Other countries would be considered for full membership in a phased manner.","WTCOMTDM29.pdf","ITC, ITC, WTO, ITC, WTO, Technical, Cooperation, Division, ITC, ITC, Chambers, of, Commerce, ITC, ITC, Members, ITC, ITC, Integrated, Framework, WTO, ITC, SPS, TBT, Uruguay, Round, Follow-up, Programme, Uruguay, Round, Uruguay, ITC, World, Trade, Net, Programme, GATS, ITC, Members, WTO, World, Trade, Net"

The Executive Director of the ITC congratulated the Chairman for his election to chair the important Committee on Trade and Development and thanked him for the time and opportunity given to them to share with the Committee some of the work done by ITC to support that of the WTO in the technical assistance field. His impression was that it was not known to all precisely how the ITC tried to complement the efforts of the WTO. Given that the Committee was discussing technical cooperation from various angles that day, it was especially opportune to be able to elaborate on ITC's work following Ambassador Seifert's presentation. First, the best of ITC's efforts were targeted towards exporting small and medium-size enterprises (SMEs), particularly from LDCs. Second, all of ITC's work relating to the WTO was done in very close collaboration and friendship with the WTO Secretariat. He asked Mr. Badrinath, the Director of the Trade Support Services Division at ITC, to give a brief overview of what was being done to support WTO's efforts in technical assistance and elaborate on one specific tool to give the Committee an example of what it meant in everyday work.

"2617",2617,"70","70.      The Chairperson of the JAG said that the Joint Advisory Group on the ITC had held its 33rd Session in Geneva from 10 to 14 April 2000.                       Its report was contained in document ITC/AG(XXXIII)/181. The terms of reference of the JAG were to review the activities of the ITC and to formulate recommendations to the governing bodies of UNCTAD and the WTO. The Group had examined the following matters during its session: ITC's technical cooperation activities in 1999, based on its annual report; the report of the Consultative Committee on the ITC Global Trust Fund; the evaluation of ITC's trade information programme, a new ITC strategy for trade information services; and the report of the 1999 ITC technical meeting. The JAG had also taken note of ITC's contribution to the Medium Term Plan of the United Nations for the period 2002-2005. During the opening session, the Deputy Director General of WTO and the Officer-in-Charge of UNCTAD had praised the crucial role that the Executive Director of the ITC had played in developing and strengthening the ITC. The three organizations had cooperated within the framework of JITAP (Joint Integrated Technical Assistance Programme in Selected Least-Developed and Other African Countries) and were also joining forces in electronic commerce, an area of vital importance for the participation of developing countries in international trade. In his statement to the Group, Mr. Bélisle had given examples of ITC's contribution to capacity-building for trade development, which was the organization's overriding objective. The ITC had already been involved in multi-country capacity-building programmes such as JITAP and could build sustainable capacities cost-effectively in a large number of countries through global programmes like the World Trade Net. During the review of ITC's technical cooperation activities in 1999, the JAG had noted that ITC's forward- looking orientation in technical assistance products and services had positioned it well to respond to the rising needs and expectations of partner countries. The JAG had adopted the Report of the Committee on the Global Trust Fund as well as the new strategy for Trade Information Services and had taken note of ITC's contribution to the Medium Term Plan of the United Nations for the period 2002-2005. As was practice each year, government representatives had announced or confirmed voluntary contributions to the ITC. On behalf of the JAG, she expressed gratitude to the Governments of Canada, Cyprus, China, Denmark, France, India, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland and Turkey as well as the Islamic Development Bank and the Agence Intergouvernementale de la Francophonie.","WTCOMTDM29.pdf","Chairperson, JAG, Joint, Advisory, Group, ITC, Geneva, ITC, UNCTAD, WTO, Group, ITC, Consultative, Committee, ITC, Global, Trust, Fund, ITC, ITC, ITC, ITC, United, Nations, Director, WTO, UNCTAD, Director, ITC, ITC, Joint, Integrated, Technical, Assistance, Programme, Group, Bélisle, ITC, ITC, ITC, JAG, ITC, Committee, Global, Trust, Fund, Trade, Information, Services, ITC, United, Nations, ITC, JAG, Canada, Cyprus, China, Denmark, France, India, Italy, Netherlands, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland, Turkey, Islamic, Development, Bank"

This update could then provide a basis from which Member could draw their own conclusions, and seek further analytical work to assist them.

"2602",2602,"57","57.      The representative of Pakistan said that special and differential treatment was one of the crucial aspects of the Uruguay Round Agreements, and that these provisions had been introduced for a variety of reasons. The prime reason was to provide developing countries with the opportunities to be on par with developed countries in terms of aspirations to development. He said that Pakistan, along with other Members, was convinced that the provisions for special and differential treatment contained in the Uruguay round had not been operative. The formulation of these provisions in a vague and ill-defined manner, largely in best-endeavour terms, had led to the problems now facing developing countries. The onerous nature of commitments undertaken by developing countries through the Uruguay Round Agreement was recognised, partially at least, at the time of concluding the agreements. The commitments were nevertheless undertaken in the belief that special and differential treatment would be provided, but unfortunately none of the provisions for special and differential treatment had been made operational. He said that the seminar held in March to discuss special and differential treatment had been useful. He echoed the Chairman in saying that, as work had begun on the question of Special and Differential Treatment in the context of the General Council, it was important to ensure that work undertaken in the CTD was not duplicative. He said that the CTD should focus on refining and redefining special and differential treatment to ensure that such treatment was made mandatory and binding.","WTCOMTDM29.pdf","Pakistan, Uruguay, Pakistan, Members, Uruguay, Uruguay, Chairman, General, Council, CTD, CTD"

He said that his delegation would expand on this issue under agenda Item K (as well as in the TRIPS Council).","WTCOMTDM29.pdf","Zambia, India"
"2600",2600,"55","55.     The representative of India recalled the statement made by his ambassador during the Seminar on Special and Differential Treatment held in March 2000, which said that special and differential treatment was one of the major problems faced by developing countries in regard to the implementation of WTO Agreements, and that the major concern was the non-binding and non-operational nature of special and differential treatment provisions in WTO Agreements. His delegation reiterated that having provisions that were devoid of any operational significance or legal enforceability was unsatisfactory, creating a false impression that benefits were accruing to developing countries. His delegation was of the view that, under the General Council process, special and differential provisions needed to be given an operational content and be made legally binding. Recalling that another participant at the Seminar on Special and Differential Treatment had made comments to the effect that special and differential treatment constituted an exception to the rules of the multilateral trading system and that the costs of such an exception needed to be evaluated, the representative of India recalled that his ambassador had responded by calling for an evaluation of the costs of exceptions to the multilateral rules of two major areas of export interest to developing countries, namely agriculture and textiles. India and other developing countries were desirous to see that binding and legally enforceable provisions for special and differential treatment were developed to reduce existing inequities in the multilateral trading system. The representative of India referred to paragraph 38 of document WT/COMTD/W/66, which reflected comments made by Egypt, and which stated that, ""It is obvious from the preceding analysis that a number of special and differential provisions have not been implemented, others have been partially implemented and a number of them WT/COMTD/M/29 Page 8 have been adequately implemented. Numerous special and differential provisions are vague and aspirational in nature and it is the collective responsibility of developed and developing countries alike to ensure that these provisions are translated into concrete benefits to developing countries."" India supported this statement, though it was of the view that only a very few special and differential provisions had been adequately implemented. Finally, his delegation was of the view that it would be useful to take into account proposals made in the preparatory process for the Seattle Ministerial Conference and in the special process of the General Council. In this connection, reference could be made to paragraph 23 of the note of the 28th Session of the CTD.","WTCOMTDM29.pdf","India, WTO, WTO, General, Council, India, India, India, Egypt, India, Seattle, Ministerial, Conference, General, Council, CTD"
"2599",2599,"54","54.      The Chairman said that, with these points in mind, it was nevertheless necessary to consider how to take forward the work of the CTD on the subject, as the oversight of the special provisions in favour of developing countries was central to the terms of reference of this Committee. He threw out some pointers to allow the CTD to structure its thinking. It was important to recall that the distinctive feature of the CTD was the horizontal nature of its work – this was well reflected in document WT/COMTD/W/66. The Chairman suggested the CTD could continue with and update the type of stock-taking contained in that document, and collate information on ongoing work on special and differential treatment in the WTO. Secondly, the Chairman said that the CTD could make use of the kind of typology of special and differential provisions was set out in document WT/COMTD/W/66 - which classified special and differential provisions into: (i) provisions aimed at increasing trade opportunities; (ii) provisions that required WTO members to safeguard the interest of developing country Members; (iii) flexibility of commitments; (iv) transitional time periods; (v) technical assistance, and (vi) provisions relating to measures to assist LDC members. He was not, however, suggesting that the CTD either endorse or tie itself rigidly into this typology. The third consideration that needed to be borne in mind in order to guide the CTD's work is that there appeared to be a near-universal acknowledgement that special and differential provisions had not contributed satisfactorily to the integration of developing countries into international trade. He said that Members would all agree that that the provisions relating to special and differential treatment, and its application, needed to be refined so that they were more responsive to the particular problems faced by Members with respect to international trade and the multilateral trading system. He noted that one of the CTD's tasks was to contribute to this process. With these preliminary comments, the Chairman opened the floor for suggestions by Members.","WTCOMTDM29.pdf","Chairman, CTD, Committee, CTD, CTD, Chairman, CTD, WTO, Chairman, CTD, WTO, Members, CTD, CTD, Members, Members, CTD, Chairman, Members"
"2598",2598,"53","53.      The Chairman recalled that at its 28th Session, the CTD had discussed the Seminar on Special and Differential Treatment held on 7 March and the Secretariat paper WT/COMTD/W/66 entitled ""Concerns regarding Special and Differential Treatment Provisions in WTO Agreements and decisions"". Following those discussions, it had been agreed that the item relating to special and differential treatment be kept on the agenda of the CTD, and that the further thought be given on how to take forward the work on this subject. The Chairman said he wished to devote the present Session of the CTD, at least in part, to discussing how this should be done, and noted that a number of suggestions had already been made by Members. Some called for a special working mechanism on special and differential treatment, while a number called for more detailed work to be carried out. It was important that the CTD recognise that since the 28th Session there had been a number of developments. Most notably, a special process on implementation had been established under the auspices of the General Council. Since concerns relating to special and differential treatment were an important part of the implementation question, it was important that the work of the CTD be sensitive to direction by the General Council, and that it did not prejudge the conclusions that might be reached through the General Council process. It was also necessary to recognise that the question of special                                                                                     WT/COMTD/M/29                                                                                             Page 7 and differential treatment was also being pursued at a very detailed technical level in relation to some specific agreements in the different subsidiary bodies of the WTO. The most recent example was the meeting of the Committee on Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures held on 21 and 22 June 2000. The Committee on Technical Barriers to Trade (TBT) was due to organise a workshop on 19 and 20 July 2000 on technical assistance and special and differential treatment in the context of the TBT Agreement, and that in this context a questionnaire has been sent out inviting Members to identify any difficulties encountered in the implementation and operation of the Agreement, as well as any technical assistance needed. It was therefore important to ensure that the work done in the CTD was fully aware of, but did not duplicate, that carried out by other bodies.","WTCOMTDM29.pdf","Chairman, CTD, Secretariat, WTO, CTD, Chairman, CTD, Members, CTD, General, Council, CTD, General, Council, General, Council, WTO, Committee, on, Sanitary, and, Phytosanitary, Measures, Committee, on, Technical, Barriers, to, Trade, Members, CTD"

A central element of UNIDO’s reform, was not only the focusing and streamlining of its technical assistance services, but also a rethinking in the way these services are being delivered. While in the past, UNIDO would address support requirements through small projects isolated from each other, the new strategy is to package services into integrated country programmes, with well- defined linkages among the various components allowing for a more holistic approach and multi- disciplinary solutions.

"2555",2555,"205","205.    Without going into the detail of all 16 services, let me briefly pinpoint those are relevant from a trade and supply-side perspective. I also wish to underline, that UNIDO is by and large a technical assistance agency, focussing on practical, project-driven type of programmes and with less emphasis to analysis, research and reporting.         •       formulation of industrial or supply-side policies. The main objective of this service is                 to encourage good industrial governance by providing policy advice and build                 institutional capacity for policy analysis and formulation. In the process of policy                 formulation and implementation, UNIDO suggests to set up public-private sector                 consultation mechanisms so as to fully involve the private sector and tap into its                 developmental potential. Often a environmental policy element is being introduced,                 such as in China, where UNIDO is conceiving strategies for the competitiveness of                 key sectors, in particular the automotive sector.         •       sub-sectoral support, Under this service modules, UNIDO seeks to strengthen the link                 between agriculture with industry and to upgrade entire productive systems in the WT/COMTD/M/29 Page 44           agro-industry sector. In line with UNIDO’s comparative expertise, priority sector           include food processing, textile and leather, wood, agro-machinery and chemicals. To           enable the production of competitive goods of consistent quality demanded by the           specific markets, UNIDO pursues a holistic approach, involving the full range of           sector-specific and cross-sectoral institutions and policy issues. Projects also           integrate factory-level support, such as technology assessments and on-the job           training on technology transfer issues, product quality, process optimization,           maintenance, cost minimization and product safety.      •    continuous improvement and quality management at the productive level. The aim of           this service module, is to restructure and upgrade industries to enhance their           competitiveness, through the introduction of quality management principles. At the           institutional level, UNIDO works with local institutions which are being trained in           enterprise diagnosis, technical audits, performance improvement and good           manufacturing practices. Through these institutions, UNIDO works directly with           enterprises which are being coached in the implementation of the financial and           operational restructuring plans.      •    support to standardization, certification and metrology bodies. The aim of this service           module is to strengthen country’s standardization infrastructure together with national           capacities at government, institutional and enterprise level. This involves the           technical and managerial upgrading of national or regional standardization bodies. It           also involves the establishment or improvement of certification and accreditation           procedures. National and regional certification and accreditation bodies are being           supported to achieve international recognition of certification for products, systems,           laboratories, tests and technical personnel. Institutions in turn improve the capacity at           the enterprise level for improved product and process quality, export performance,           environmental performance and certification to relevant international standards.           A good example of this service module has found application in Uganda, whose           exports to the EU were banned due to the contamination of fish from the Great Lakes.           In parallel with the formulation of safety regulations and inspection standards,           UNIDO has been setting up a laboratory and certification procedure to ensure           compliance with EU regulations, as a result of which Uganda managed to obtain re-           access of its fish products to the European market.      •    cleaner production programmes, pollution control and waste management. The           objective is to create a sustainable balance between industrial development and           environmental management and conservation.           By advising on appropriate clean and waste management technologies and related           production processes, UNIDO seeks to reduce environmental degradation and           pollution caused by industrial production. A centrepiece in this are the national           cleaner production centres (CPCs), which provide advisory services to the local           industry. UNIDO has established CPCs in some 17 countries ( including Guatemala,           Morocco, the Russian Federation, Hungary, India, Nicaragua, Mexico, Slovakia,           Tunisia, Tanzania, Vietnam and Tanzania), while an additional three are planned in           Ethiopia, Kenya and Mozambique.           A sector-specific centre, focusing on the oil and gas industry, was established in the           Russian Federation. In the pesticide sector, a regional cleaner production and           information programme covers some 15 countries in Asia and the Pacific. This                                                                                      WT/COMTD/M/29                                                                                             Page 45                resulted in the banning of the most persistent and toxic pesticides and facilitated the                introduction of new environmentally friendly and bio-pesticides.        •       private sector and enterprise development. UNIDO places private sector development                at the core of its vision and technical assistance and fully subscribes to the global shift                away from government intervention towards the creation of an environment in which                market forces play a dominant role.                UNIDO projects are based on an integrated support strategy, that may include the                promotion of a more favourable policy and institutional environment for SMEs, the                strengthening of business service centres and business incubators with a view to                create, expand and modernize private enterprises. They may also involve the                formation of SME clusters of enterprises to allow for collective business strategies.                Such an integrated private sector development programme is under implementation in                Guinea, where he types of enterprises targeted vary form micro and small enterprises                (such as artisans in the traditional textile sector) to formal, medium-sized enterprises (                ready to engage in partnerships with foreign investors).                In addition, UNIDO is increasingly establishing linkages with institutions and                enterprises in the private sector of developed countries, many of which have become                partners in projects or providers of technical cooperation. In India, for example,                UNIDO has forged a partnership with FIAT, INSEAD, the Prince of Wales Business                Leaders Forum, and the automotive component manufacturers association of India.                The aim is to strengthen the supply chain of Indian SMEs in the automotive                component sector, with a view to linking them up with the supplier network of FIAT.                Through provision of shop-floor level expert advice in areas such as management,                quality, productivity, Indian SME’s are being upgraded to meet international quality                levels and become accredited suppliers to FIAT.        •       investment and technology promotion. Investment and technological innovation are                the prime movers of economic development and globalization. To achieve sustainable                increases in investment and technology flows, UNIDO strengthens local investment                promotion agencies in the promotion and negotiation of foreign investment and                technology projects, with a view to forming international industrial partnerships,                particularly among SMEs. To this end, UNIDO offers a package of tools and                methodologies for the formulation and appraisal of investment projects, their                promotion towards foreign investors, the finalization of cooperation agreements as                well as linkages with the financing system. Under a recent initiative, the UNIDO                Exchange, UNIDO is setting up an electronic platform, accessible through our home                page, which includes databases on investment opportunities, technologies and many                referral points, while allowing partners to engage in business interactions.

Basically, UNIDO has been refocusing its services into 16 core services in pursuit of sustainable industrial development, which the organization defines as competitive economy, productive employment, and a sound environment (the so-called 3 E’s). These basic dimensions capture the essence of UNIDO’s services, intended to enhance the competitiveness of enterprises and of the countries in which they operate, to address and prevent ecological problems in industrialization, and to stimulate the creation of productive jobs.

With regard to difficulties experienced by developing countries in the pursuit of their rights within the WTO, it was noted that special and differential treatment provisions were ambiguous, couched in ""best endeavour"" terms, and not enforceable. In addition, matters of ""interpretation"" of WTO provisions had become increasingly significant and had raised questions regarding the balance between policy discretion of individual Members, the collective decision-making responsibilities of the Membership, and the scope and reach of the Dispute Settlement Mechanism.

"2545",2545,"197","197.    A number of speakers pointed out that not all implementation issues could be addressed by technical assistance, capacity building measures or financial support. In some cases, implementation involved short-term adjustment costs, while benefits would accrue in the longer term. Implementation was especially problematic where costs appeared to be a certainty, and benefits only a possibility. It was suggested that greater impetus could be given to implementation if actions in developing countries were matched by actions in developed countries in areas where developing countries held comparative advantage.","WTCOMTDM29.pdf",""
"2544",2544,"196","196.    Speakers pointed to the need for coherence in addressing issues related to implementation. One idea that was stressed was the need to develop an overall strategy that could match implementation objectives with costs, time-periods, and inputs of technical and financial assistance. Some speakers pointed to the need to resolve an inherent tension between the horizontal rule-making approach pursued by the WTO and a case-by-case approach that took into account the specific constraints of individual countries.","WTCOMTDM29.pdf","WTO"
"2543",2543,"195","195.    Technical assistance and capacity-building were cited as important factors in assisting implementation. In the areas of Intellectual Property Rights and Customs Valuation, specialized agencies such as the WIPO and the WCO devoted considerable resources to supporting Members in the implementation process. Speakers pointed to problems in WTO technical assistance resulting from difficulties in funding and a focus on the holding of seminars and workshops, which had limited impact in facilitating implementation. Issues of concern to least-developed countries were raised, notably the severe capacity constraints faced by such countries, which hampered their ability to participate effectively in international trade and to implement their WTO commitments. Emphasis was given to the need to facilitate access to technology, and to ensure that the Integrated Framework delivered tangible results.","WTCOMTDM29.pdf","Intellectual, Property, Rights, and, Customs, Valuation, WIPO, WCO, Members, WTO, WTO, Integrated, Framework"
"2542",2542,"194","194.     The question arose whether the implementation of certain WTO agreements in some countries made economic sense from a policy perspective. It was suggested that a negative answer could perhaps be given, particularly for certain least-developed countries, where the implementation of certain agreements was particularly onerous from a budgetary point of view. However, the point was made that the implementation of Agreements which imposed heavy demands on resources could nevertheless yield significant benefits by improving the transparency and predictability of policy regimes and thus signalling the credibility of policy reform to foreign investors. A positive outcome would also result where implementation required the phasing out of trade-distorting measures.","WTCOMTDM29.pdf","WTO"
"2541",2541,"193","193.     Some speakers pointed to perceived asymmetries in WTO Agreements, and a lack of balance in rights and obligations applying to developing country Members.

"2540",2540,"192","192.    A separate set of implementation concerns related to the perception by some Members that anticipated benefits had failed to materialise owing to insufficient action on the part of others. Members cited textiles and clothing, continuing market access barriers and domestic support measures in agriculture, insufficient ""Mode Four"" liberalisation in services, the cost of anti-dumping actions for developing country exports, and a lack of operationalization of provisions relating to transfer of         1             This was first issued as Job No. 4175 on 30/06/2000.

"2539",2539,"191","191.    Concerning the process of bringing national policy regimes into conformity with multilateral rules and disciplines, presentations made by panelists and from the floor drew attention to the magnitude of human and financial resources and technical and institutional capacity required to implement a number of the WTO Agreements and to ensure their proper enforcement. This was perhaps most vividly illustrated by the case of the TRIPS Agreement and the Agreement on Customs Valuation. The point was also made that failure to achieve conformity was not always primarily a result of resource or capacity constraints. For example, in the TRIMs Agreement, lack of implementation could also stem from policy considerations, particularly in relation to the anticipated costs of adjustment associated with the phasing out of WTO inconsistent measures, notably in the automotive industry, where most remaining TRIMs were being used.","WTCOMTDM29.pdf","WTO, Customs, Valuation, WTO"

Presentations showed that the general theme of implementation covered a number of distinct, but inter-related, issues, including the process of bringing national policy regimes into conformity with multilateral rules and disciplines; a perception by some Members that benefits expected from the Uruguay Round Agreements had failed to materialise; and a perception by some Members that there existed imbalances and asymmetries in Agreements.

The seminar was opened by the Director-General, who said that implementation issues were among the main reasons for the failure to reach agreement in Seattle and remained a key to the launching of any new negotiations. A special mechanism established under the General Council had just begun its work, and the seminar should provide insights which would help that process. Developing countries had an interest in implementing fully WTO Agreements, but there were real problems that required time and technical assistance, while WTO resources were limited. While some options for industrial development may be foreclosed through implementation, there were other WTO consistent measures for this purpose, and the Director-General indicated his interest in hearing Members' views on the options. He believed the seminar would be a useful start in the process of resolving the difficult questions relating to implementation.","WTCOMTDM29.pdf","WTO, WTO, Committee, on, Trade, and, Development, Director-General, Seattle, General, Council, WTO, WTO, WTO, Director-General, Members"

These economies were listed in the document. Japan's intention to exclude these economies was first notified in WT/COMTD/N/2/Add.7 of 10 June 1998. He quoted from the final paragraph of Annex 1 to that document, which read: ""starting from 1 April 2000, a beneficiary country or territory is to be excluded from the list of GSP beneficiaries if it is classified as a high income economy in the previous three years' World Bank Atlas in a row or, when it is not on the World Bank Atlas, recognized to have the same level of GNP per capita."" In setting such a criterion, Japan had considered the purpose and objectives of the GSP, and the level of development of the territory in question. Also considered was the strength of domestic industry in Japan, the need to expand benefits to beneficiaries other than advanced economies, and modifications made by other countries providing preferences through the GSP.","WTCOMTDM29.pdf","Japan, Japan, Japan, GSP, World, Bank, Atlas, World, Bank, Atlas, Japan, GSP, Japan, GSP"

He said that there were two additional aspects which could be added to the current work programme: the first was a possible resumption of work on electronic commerce, and the second was the possible input of the WTO to the United Nations High Level Initiative on Financing for Development. These additions depended on the outcome of the General Council to be held on 17 July.

"2525",2525,"179","179.     The representative of Zambia thanked the staff of the Development Division for their full cooperation, and especially Ms Métivier and Mrs Vittori of the division's secretariat. His delegation wished to thank all delegations of both developing and developed countries that had supported or showed a positive attitude to the proposal made presented by Zambia at the 28th Session of the CTD. He said that such an attitude was a real motivation for smaller missions such as his to participate in the meetings of the WTO. He said that the ultimate objective of the implementation exercise and of work in the WTO was to strengthen the supply capacity of developing countries, especially LDCs, by creating a sound technology base. Because technology development was the basis for development, transfer arrangements tended to be economically and technologically complex. It was important to develop capabilities within these countries to facilitate the acquisition of technology. It was in this context that Zambia had presented a proposal at the 28th Session of the CTD, which received support from members, and which Zambia hoped would soon be an integral part of the CTD work programme. He said that the Zambia proposal assumed that efforts by the WTO in the implementation of provisions on technology transfer needed to be complemented by other organisations. The essence of the proposal contained in document WT/COMTD/W67 was to kick-start the process of implementation of the provisions relating to technology transfer to developing countries, particularly LDCs, which all Members realised was at the heart of improving the integration of such economies in the global trading system. The proposal was not about technical assistance, but about the exploration of a mechanism to implement these provisions. While technical assistance remained important in improving supply capacity, it was not a substitute for technology- content products that were essential for developing countries to compete. He said that in order to compete effectively, products from developing countries needed a technology content, and its blending with current forms of capacity-building. On its own, the current form of capacity building would not do much to salvage the trade position of LDCs. Technology content was the dynamo and only hope for integrating LDCs in the world trading system. He said that Zambia were aware of Uruguay Round Agreements that were supply-oriented. In addition to TRIPS, other opportunities, that were refered to in the seminar on implementation issues, did exist for the WTO to spur the supply response of LDCs. These included Agreements such as the GATS, SPS, TBT, TRIMs, Subsidies, Services, and issues such as coherence. He said that at a later stage it would perhaps be possible to specify to the CTD the potential opportunities of other agreements. What was needed was simply the political will among developed country trading partners. This was why Zambia wished to put technology transfer at the centre of WTO activities. Technology transfer required a series of steps, and the Zambian proposal was about starting that process. He said that in this context, his delegation strongly supported the suggestion made by Norway in the 28th Session of the CTD that the international organisations listed in the proposal, namely the UNCTAD, the WIPO, the UNIDO, and the World Bank, and indeed any other organisation competent in the area of technology be invited to provide information on their work in the area of technology. As was said in the seminar on implementation, approaches existed through which technology transfer could be achieved. The contributions of organisations such as those mentioned above, and individual experts such as Mr. Jeffrey Sachs, would go a long way in assisting the WTO to implement such important provisions.","WTCOMTDM29.pdf","Zambia, Mrs, Vittori, Zambia, CTD, WTO, WTO, Zambia, CTD, Zambia, CTD, Zambia, WTO, Members, Zambia, Uruguay, WTO, GATS, SPS, TBT, CTD, Zambia, WTO, Norway, UNCTAD, WIPO, UNIDO, World, Bank, Jeffrey, Sachs, WTO"

The Director, Development Division said that the Secretariat had initiated a number of activities in respect of non-resident members, of which there were 28, and non-resident observers of which there were nine. Of these 37 countries, 17 were least-developed. The first of these initiatives was the hosting by the WTO of the ""Geneva Week"" in favour of non-residents. A first Geneva Week was held in November 1999, and the second Geneva Week was scheduled for a full week, running from 21 to 27 October 2000. It would immediately follow the meeting of the UNCTAD's Trade and Development Board, beginning with the holding of a seminar on small economies under the auspices of the CTD, on 21 October, and finishing with the 31st Session of the CTD scheduled for 27 October. He said that the proposed programme for Geneva Week 2000 gave emphasis to mandated negotiations; to implementation issues; to developments in the field of technical cooperation (including the new structure of the Integrated Framework); to developments in relation to market access and electronic commerce; and to development in the ""Trade and…"" topics, such as trade and environment, trade and investment and so forth. It was hoped that other organisations could be invited. It was intended to finance the participation of one representative from capitals, and one from the European-based Mission (where this existed). The total cost of the week was estimated at approximately SwF570,000. The Secretariat would be looking for assistance from Members to meet the costs of Geneva Week 2000. The second of these initiatives was the preparation of briefing notes, which gave an overview of selected areas of WTO work. The notes were sent out by e-mail and fax to non- residents. The notes drew on material already available to Members, and were intended to provide non-residents with a concise overview of on-going activities. The third set of initiatives lay in discussions held by the Director-General with non-resident Members and certain smaller resident Members in order to examine ways of enhancing the participation of such members in the work of the WTO. In this context, some Members had proposed that there be established a centre to support the work of non-residents. In considering such a proposal, it was necessary to avoid duplication with other facilities existing in Geneva, to ensure that there was ownership of the work carried out by the centre, and to ensure that the work was truly responsive to the needs of non-residents. Finally, the attention of Members was drawn to a questionnaire circulated on 24 May 2000 requesting feedback from Member on various aspects of WTO work. To date, 40 replies had been received, out of which 33 were developing or transition economies. Feedback was sought on the utility of different tools used by the Secretariat to facilitate the dissemination of information. Responses received showed that the WTO web-site was found by delegations to be most useful, followed by press-releases, the Document Dissemination Facility and the Integrated Data-Base. Members had suggested that improvements could be made to the Daily Bulletin, in terms of augmenting and standardising the information contained therein.","WTCOMTDM29.pdf","Director, Development, Division, Secretariat, WTO, Geneva, Week, UNCTAD, Trade, and, Development, Board, CTD, CTD, Integrated, Framework, Secretariat, Members, WTO, Members, Director-General, Members, Members, WTO, Members, Geneva, Members, Member, WTO, Secretariat, WTO, Integrated, Data-Base, Members"

He assumed, therefore, that information on any actions taken by developed Members under their GSP schemes in favour of LDCs would also be provided in this way. On the other hand, steps taken by developing countries under the 1999 Waiver on Preferential Tariff Treatment for LDCs were to be notified to the Council on Trade in Goods. There was clearly an inconsistency here. What he propose was that, with Members' permission, he would consult with the Chairman of the CTG (and with the Chair of the Sub-Committee on LDCs) on how to resolve this inconsistency.

He said that OPEC had also applied to the Committee on Trade and Environment (CTE), and that by applying to both the CTD and the CTE, it wished to correct the impression that it was only concerned with price and quota fixing, which were the most visible parts of its activities. He said that OPEC was                                                                                   WT/COMTD/M/29                                                                                           Page 3 also seriously concerned with the environmental impact of oil resources, as well as the equilibrium between oil producers and oil exporters. OPEC therefore sought ad hoc Observer Status with the CTD and the CTE, in order to benefit from the work of the Committees in these areas. He said that the Nigerian delegation strongly supported the application by OPEC for ad hoc Observer Status, and called on members to give the application favourable consideration.","WTCOMTDM29.pdf","Nigeria, OPEC, OPEC, Committee, OPEC, Members, CTD, OPEC, OPEC, WTO, OPEC, Committee, on, Trade, and, Environment, CTD, CTE, OPEC, OPEC, CTD, CTE, OPEC"

The representative of the Secretariat said that the agenda for the Days of Reflection included a series of discussion items based on what was raised in the Committee and also on elements considered internally by the Secretariat. If the United States delegation wished to make comments the Secretariat would welcome it, bearing in mind that time was short. Broadly speaking, the programme had an introduction and seven working sessions, to be spread over the two days. The Secretariat had invited developed and developing country speakers for different sessions to stimulate discussion. The Chairman would subsequently make a report on his own responsibility. In discussing a possible date for a special session of the CTD following the Days of Reflection, some delegations were of the view that 28 July would be too soon and had asked for a session in September. As for the agenda of other CTD activities, the only upcoming event would be the Seminar on Small Economies, the programme of which would be circulated in due course and delegations would have a chance to comment.","WTCOMTDM29.pdf","Secretariat, Committee, Secretariat, United, States, Secretariat, Secretariat, Chairman, CTD"

"2500",2500,"156","156.    The representative of Japan said that he wished to expand on the Japanese proposal on capacity building as submitted to APEC related to the implementation of WTO Agreements, which was endorsed at the APEC trade ministers meeting held in Darwin on 7 June 2000. He would explain his delegation's proposal based on the summary of the proposal in document WT/COMTD/W/75. The full version submitted to APEC had been circulated as a room document that day. The background of the proposal was clear and self-explanatory. Developing Members of the WTO were facing difficulties in implementing WTO Agreements. The question of implementation had been taken up as an important issue in the preparatory process and was one of the reasons why the Members could not reach consensus at the Third Ministerial Conference in Seattle. In order to strengthen the multilateral trading system and also to integrate developing members within the system, capacity-building related to implementation of WTO Agreements was a matter of priority. In the WTO, the importance of confidence-building measures had been confirmed in early May. In APEC, Japan's proposal of capacity-building as APEC's contribution to the WTO had been welcomed by senior officials earlier that year. The draft proposal had then been circulated to all APEC WT/COMTD/M/29 Page 34 members. The revised proposal had been endorsed at the APEC Trade ministers meeting in Darwin, Australia on 6-7 June. The purpose of the proposal was to facilitate the implementation of WTO Agreements and the integration of developing economies into the multilateral trading system and to alleviate the concerns and the burden of the developing economies of APEC to participate in a new round. The WTO and other organizations were reviewing the IF, which was designed to support capacity-building of least developed countries. The Director-General and the Secretariat were engaged in discussions on capacity-building with other relevant international organizations, such as the World Bank. On 6 July there would be a high-level coordination meeting on the improvement of the IF. His delegation fully understood that least-developed countries had major needs for capacity-building and supported the IF. However, more attention needed to be paid to developing countries in general, including developing economies in APEC. That was the reason why Japan had introduced the proposal in APEC on strategy and on measures to help developing economies in APEC to support capacity building needs. The gist of the proposal was that based on the needs of the individual economies APEC should have its own initiative for strengthening capacity-building activities in developing economies, with the cooperation of developed economies in the area, the WTO and other relevant international organizations. The Japanese proposal consisted of four elements: (a) identification of needs and drafting of proposals and the APEC strategy; (b) endorsement of the APEC strategy to be utilised as appropriate in the context of the development strategy of members and related international organizations; (c) identification of possible sources of funding for the programme; (d) creation of a mechanism for achieving and following up the programme. Regarding the objectives to enhance capacity in developing countries, they envisaged the following six elements: (i) expanding knowledge and skills for implementation of WTO Agreements; (ii) developing a legal framework for domestic implementation; (iii) enhancing the physical infrastructure for domestic implementation; (iv) enhancing the negotiation skills of those participating in international negotiations; (v) building capacity to participate in the international dispute settlement mechanisms of the WTO; (vi) contributing to support for accession to WTO by new Members. Questionnaires would be used for the effective identification of needs of developing economies in these six categories, on the basis of which studies would be conducted. Through such studies, the needs of developing countries in APEC would be identified in detail and concrete projects would be designed. Two case studies had already carried out to assess the needs for capacity-building, and there was a very ambitious schedule to carry out the project. First, on 6-7 June, Trade Ministers had already agreed to develop further the APEC strategy. Second, after the Trade Ministers meeting, Japan was to distribute the questionnaires to all APEC developing countries. Third, by the end of August, interested economies would respond to the questionnaires. Fourth, from September to October, a coordinating group of APEC members would coordinate further activities in view of the studies held in interested economies. Next, on 12-13 November, on the occasion of the APEC Ministerial Meeting in Brunei and on the basis of the activities already explained, Ministers would be asked to endorse the APEC strategy to be utilised as appropriate in the context of the development strategies of members. The investment liberalization fund would be allocated to possible pilot projects. At the same time, it was hoped that Ministers would agree that Members would adjust their priorities as appropriate in their development programmes in the light of the APEC strategy. Ministers would also be asked to invite relevant international development organizations such as World Bank and the Asian Development Bank to provide support for the programme. APEC Trade Ministers supported the Japanese proposal to help developing members of APEC in capacity-building related to the implementation of WTO Agreements. Japan would continue to cooperate with all APEC economies, the WTO Secretariat and other relevant international organizations to achieve a meaningful result from the initiative. He hoped that his explanation would help Members understand the APEC initiative and that the initiative would complement efforts in the WTO to enhance capacity-building for implementation of WTO Agreements. As a supplementary point, another representative of Japan, said that it was an APEC initiative and did not directly relate to WTO. The paper had been introduced for two reasons: for transparency purposes and to see if any lessons could be drawn from the APEC activities. They found that the spirit of the APEC initiative had commonalties with the EC initiative.

"2497",2497,"153","153.     The representative of Norway joined previous speakers in thanking the EC for their constructive paper, which contained a lot of good ideas. Norway shared the objective of better coordination and structuring of trade related technical assistance, including the formulation of objectives and monitoring and evaluation of projects. Members could learn from UN organizations with vast experience in projects, including those which were not necessarily technical projects on WTO matters. Nevertheless, the U.N. had something to teach on how to monitor and evaluate projects. Her delegation fully agreed with the EC that there was need for more coherence in carrying out of technical assistance activities in the trade area in order to make it more efficient and to avoid overlap. Norway was not convinced that coordination needed to be done within the WTO. The WTO should not develop into becoming more of a technical assistance organization, but rather its technical assistance should aimed at helping Members to meet their obligations and benefit from their rights in accordance with the Agreements. The challenge would be to find a modality on how to achieve coherence and coordination between technical assistance activities of WTO, other IGOs and donor countries. Norway found the proposed pilot project on customs valuation to be a good initiative. It was not meant to be exhaustive and other trade-related areas could be of interest as well. She recalled an intervention by the Moroccan Ambassador at a meeting on implementation some time ago where he had underlined the need for LDCs in Africa to define their needs in the implementation area. It all boiled down to financing, as had been mentioned by several speakers. She fully subscribed to what had been eloquently stated by the delegate of Hong Kong, China, both with respect to voluntary contributions and to the financing of technical assistance through the regular budget.","WTCOMTDM29.pdf","Norway, EC, Norway, Members, UN, WTO, U.N., EC, Norway, WTO, WTO, Members, WTO, Norway, Ambassador, LDCs, Africa, Hong, Kong, China"
"2496",2496,"152","152.     The representative of Mexico said that the intention of the EC paper was to reach better coherence in the application of technical assistance in the organization. The new focus of the EU was based on two pillars: technical assistance and capacity building. There was a clear distinction being made between the two. The aim of the former was to promote the understanding and use of the WTO rules so that recipients were able to exploit to a maximum the opportunities offered by the multilateral trading system. That approach was already being applied in various Committees and the Technical Cooperation Division. The second, capacity-building, went beyond technical assistance and was implicit in the Integrated Framework, which emphasized administrative, technical and financial capacity building. It would be important to follow and learn from developments in the IF. In the area of Customs Valuation, there was already a technical assistance programme, coordinated with the Technical Cooperation Division. There was a coherent approach since both the Committee and the                                                                                    WT/COMTD/M/29                                                                                           Page 33 Division carried out the administration of the programme and examined technical assistance support that was being provided by other IGOs, regional organizations and bilateral assistance. Presenting the outcome of the pilot project in the CTD would be very useful. The lack of funding was a fundamental concern in the exercise. With respect to the Integrated Framework, according to information received recently, a fund had been set up at UNCTAD to be able to focus attention on the projects that had been presented in the framework of the IF. However, at present, it seemed that no project had been implemented due to lack of funding.         In the WTO, there was a Global Fund, through which developed countries could make contributions in order to support technical assistance. This was a good channel, a part from the possibility of having more funds available from the regular budget.","WTCOMTDM29.pdf","Mexico, EC, EU, WTO, Customs, Valuation, Technical, Cooperation, Division, Committee, CTD, UNCTAD, WTO"

They acknowledged the commitment of the EC in providing resources for the initial pilot project. Technical assistance in the area of building capacity needed to focus on improving expertise in trade policy formulation and not only on implementation. Implementation was important but there were also other aspects of trade policy which needed to be given due consideration. Countries needed to understand the principles and rationale behind the approach to the multilateral system: trade policy courses provided such an opportunity. Funding was a major concern and they welcomed the initiatives of donor countries in contributing to technical assistance activities.","WTCOMTDM29.pdf","Malaysia, EC, EC"

The representative of Canada supported the overall thrust of the EC paper, which advocated among other things a demand-driven and more coherent technical assistance approach. Canada also expressed support for the Japanese paper on trade-related capacity building. There were cross-links between the APEC work and the EU proposal. Technical assistance was a priority and it was important to continue to reflect on it. The various reports provided by the Secretariat were useful in that respect. With respect to the funding of technical assistance activities, Canada maintained the view that a greater part should be financed through the regular budget of the WTO.","WTCOMTDM29.pdf","Canada, EC, Canada, APEC, EU, Secretariat, Canada, WTO"

The representative of Bangladesh said that the EC delegate's introduction had outlined the basic ideas that the EC wished to follow in its technical assistance activities in the WTO. Bangladesh welcomed the recognition by the EU that more needed to be done in the area. There was consensus that adequate resources would need to be found. There was a group of countries that needed to be brought into the mainstream of technical assistance activities. They wished to see the principles of ownership, participation, coherence, a demand-driven approach, etc., played up in the new system. If those principles were followed diligently, it would increase the value-added in technical assistance activities. He welcomed the proposal that the Integrated Framework be brought into parallel play in the new system. The IF provided a parallel but very important set of activities which donor countries, particularly important donors like the EC, would have to follow with more diligence. Bangladesh also welcomed the fact that the EC was not in favor of expanding the IF at that stage. His delegation was concerned sometime back that there were discussions about expanding the stillborn or not fully developed IF into other areas. There was no question of expanding it to other countries than the LDCs until they had seen how it shaped up. Bangladesh also appreciated the point made by the EC that they wished to see a trade and supply response as well as other trade-related activities mainstreamed into the WTO work, reflecting the development strategies of the poorest. With respect to the Customs Valuation Agreement, he was sure that the EC would keep in mind the different needs of countries in the new programme. For example, his country had already entered the new phase of the Customs Valuation Agreement commitments. Therefore, his country's needs were different from those of a country which was awaiting transition. If there was an overarching concern about being fair and equal to all countries, that in itself would be unfair.","WTCOMTDM29.pdf","Bangladesh, EC, EC, WTO, Bangladesh, EU, Integrated, Framework, EC, Bangladesh, EC, Bangladesh, EC, WTO, Customs, Valuation, Agreement, EC, Customs, Valuation, Agreement"
"2491",2491,"148","148.    The representative of Jamaica thanked the EC for their interesting paper and said that an integrated approach as proposed should prove to be a more efficient means of delivering technical assistance and ensuring that technical assistance from and the policies of international organizations were harmonized. Full participation by recipient countries and a demand-driven orientation should realize great effectiveness and efficiency in the use of technical assistance funding. There was a general impression that technical assistance was supply-side driven to a significant degree, resulting in a poor match between needs and resources. In the recent seminar on implementation, her delegation had raised the point that the implementation needs of developing countries went well beyond a basic introduction to elements of the WTO Agreements as many difficulties were encountered in the actual hands-on or practical application of the Agreements. Such had been Jamaica's experience. Jamaica had benefitted from assistance in implementing the Customs Valuation Agreement; however, it faced similar resource constraints in implementing other WTO Agreements, such as those relating to trade remedy rules. Jamaica would not expect the implementation of a new approach to result in a reduction of the current total level of assistance to recipient countries. The gap in funding to cover technical activities for the year 2000 and beyond was a perennial concern requiring a long-term, predictable and stable solution. The solution was in providing funding from the regular budget. Jamaica welcomed the fact that the importance of providing technical assistance for WT/COMTD/M/29 Page 32 implementing WTO Agreements and for wider capacity building had come increasingly to the forefront of discussions in the organization.","WTCOMTDM29.pdf","Jamaica, EC, WTO, Jamaica, Jamaica, Customs, Valuation, Agreement, WTO, Jamaica, Jamaica, WTO"
"2490",2490,"147","147.    The representative of Hong Kong, China was of the view that the new approach would improve the quality and effectiveness of technical assistance to the Members in need. Capacity-building could and needed to be addressed in a broader sense to ensure that technical assistance activities in the WTO were properly focused. It was important to give consideration in parallel to improving the functioning of the Integrated Framework so as to contribute to the enhancement of the work in capacity-building. As for funding, they appreciated that some Members, including the EC and their member states, had been making voluntary extra-budgetary contributions to enable technical assistance activities to be undertaken. However, funding from the regular budget was the only way to secure stability and continuity of technical assistance activities. The representative reiterated its strong support and intention to actively contribute to the work towards this goal, hoping that a satisfactory solution would be achieved in the near future.","WTCOMTDM29.pdf","Hong, Kong, China, Members, WTO, Integrated, Framework, Members, EC"
"2489",2489,"146","146.    The representative of the European Communities said that in conjunction with the document WT/COMTD/W/69 on technical assistance, there was another document circulated in the Customs Valuation Committee with the symbol G/VAL/W/71. The European Communities had circulated a document on Trade-Related Technical Assistance in the WTO in April of that year (WT/COMTD/W/69). He wished to explain to the Committee the guiding concepts which had led them to introduce the paper, and also to explore with the Committee how to proceed. The Community strongly welcomed the fact that one of the results of the Seattle Ministerial, which without ambiguity was positive, was the new approach by Members on technical assistance in the WTO. The issue had been the subject of intensive debate in the CTD, but also in the General Council where various contributions by individual delegations and the WTO Secretariat had been put forward. There was broad consensus in the organization that it was necessary to have more and better technical assistance. The time had come to translate the consensus into concrete action. It was not an easy exercise, as the delivery of technical assistance was complex, involved many players, required adequate financial and human resources, and a clear vision of what the Members wanted to achieve. The first result of the EC's thinking was contained in document WT/COMTD/W/69. The key principles governing their thinking, which they did not claim to have invented, but which they wanted to reinforce, were: (i) ownership, a demand-driven approach, including full participation by the recipients to better target the actual needs; and (ii) better cooperation between the donors to enhance coherence and better use of funds and serious follow-up once technical assistance measures had been implemented to draw the appropriate lessons. These principles were well known to Members, as they formed the core of the Integrated Framework which had been agreed in 1997. It was not the place to assess the work of the Integrated Framework, which would be done in the Committee in a different context. Whatever the views were on the Integrated Framework, the principles governing it remained valid and were the appropriate starting-point for further reflection on technical assistance in the WTO. The same conclusion had been drawn in different contexts. The recent statement of the Chair following the Darwin APEC Ministerial contained an Annex B, which included capacity building in APEC related to the implementation of the WTO Agreements. It was worth noting that their emphasis on the principles of the Integrated Framework did not mean that they wanted to expand the Integrated Framework in its present form to other countries. It was premature, and had the inherent danger of lessening the attention they all had to pay to the difficult situation of the LDCs. The EC attached importance to coherence in the international setting. Many delegations had pointed out that technical assistance had to go beyond the mere implementation via domestic laws of the highly technical WTO Agreements. Building domestic capacities and achieving supply-side reform required a large variety of measures, which were trade-related, but which the WTO Secretariat with its limited means could not tackle on its own. The EC had witnessed progress in the effort to mainstream trade into                                                                                      WT/COMTD/M/29                                                                                             Page 31 development strategies but certainly more remained to be done in cooperation with all international development institutions. The EC wished to inform the Committee that they had taken a first step in the Customs Valuation Committee to see how they could turn their good intentions to concrete action. While the document circulated had qualified the approach therein as a pilot project, the EC were of the view that it was more adequate to talk of a renewed approach to customs valuation aiming at strengthening and reinvigorating the approach already taken in that Committee. Looking at the activities undertaken in that Committee, the EC had found that a bottom-up approach to technical assistance in line with their own had already been taken. It meant that the Committee had looked at the individual needs of countries which had problems in meeting certain deadlines and had identified the necessary steps which would enable countries concerned to implement the various provisions of the Customs Valuation Agreement. It had also tried to coordinate the various actors which delivered technical assistance. The EC had taken the initiative to systematise and generalise the principles underlining the approach, in order to strengthen and reinforce the direction of the ongoing work. The initiative would also help gain experience in applying the general principle referred to earlier in a very important area of WTO work. If successful, a similar targeted approach could be adopted for example in the areas of Technical Barriers to Trade (TBT) or Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures (SPS). The Chair of the Customs Valuation Committee had been mandated to consult informally and the EC hoped to have consensus on the concrete steps necessary to strengthen technical assistance in customs valuation very soon. The CTD would be kept informed. The EC hoped that the results of their efforts in the area of customs valuation, and soon after in other Committees, would allow the Committee on Trade and Development to evaluate the results of the EC's renewed approach in line with the CTD's responsibilities on technical assistance and capacity building.","WTCOMTDM29.pdf","European, Communities, Customs, Valuation, Committee, European, Communities, WTO, Committee, Committee, Community, Seattle, Ministerial, Members, WTO, CTD, General, Council, WTO, Secretariat, Members, EC, Members, Integrated, Framework, Committee, WTO, APEC, APEC, WTO, Integrated, Framework, EC, WTO, WTO, Secretariat, EC, EC, Committee, Customs, Valuation, Committee, EC, Committee, Committee, EC, Committee, Customs, Valuation, Agreement, EC, WTO, Customs, Valuation, Committee, EC, CTD, EC, Committee, on, Trade, and, Development, EC, CTD"

They too were interested in seeing more coordination in-house. The way the agenda for that day had been structured certainly went quite far in the area of internal coordination. It certainly helped them understand better what was going on with respect to WTO-specific technical assistance. At times it was hard for them track down where a certain amount of their funding had gone. It would be better if there were one central source for channelling all information on funding so that all technical assistance activities could be easily tracked down. Further to recent legislative decisions in the United States, her delegation was looking into additional funding for technical assistance.                 Comprehensive documentation on WTO technical assistance initiatives would help them get a better picture of which areas they should be targetting in addition to their bilateral assistance and WTO technical assistance.

"2487",2487,"144","144.     A representative of the Secretariat said that he would focus on some of the many points raised by Members. He was glad that some of the ex-participants of the trade policy courses had contributed to the discussion on study tours, which dated back 45 years and which had always been considered as an integral part of the programme. It provided the participants with an opportunity to see in practice what the WTO or formerly the GATT meant for government officials. The aim was to ensure that the programme offered during the study tours was directly relevant to the curriculum that had been followed during the trade policy course. At times, it was impossible to avoid a certain departure from that, for example, when visiting a private enterprise which was not familiar with all facets of the WTO. As for visits at the governmental level, it was a useful addition to the theoretical programme for the participants to see how policies were formulated, coordinated, and then implemented. They had also been considering reallocating the funds possibly to finance additional fellowships. However, the decision was not taken lightly because they were aware of the usefulness of the study tours, not only for the participants, but also for the host countries, which considered them as long-term investment. They were far from being tourism activities even if that was at times part of the programme. The host countries had themselves attached high importance to the tours and had committed a lot of money to it, expecting a return in the long term. The representative of Chile had suggested that there be better coordination with other technical cooperation activities in the house, namely, with some of the other courses taking place, either on dispute settlement or on other selected issues. They were not adjusting the course programme to fit other activities, which were meant to reach out to more people, not just to train the same people. Whatever was being taught in the special courses was also covered in the regular courses. With respect to the comment of the representative of Venezuela on having participants of the same level, he said that the selection was done on the basis of written application. While certain participants might look alike on paper, that might not in fact be the case. Besides, they were not aiming at uniformity in that respect, since their mandate was not to provide a specialized course to train experts, but rather to provide a better understanding of all the WTO Agreements and the multilateral trading system to participants, who would contribute to policy formation once they returned to their capitals. There had been some problems in this respect in certain groups. There was possibly a misunderstanding of the objectives of the courses, which were explained in the invitation letter. The addition of economies in transition to the list of invitees had not been at the detriment of the other countries. The economies in transition did not get priority in receiving fellowships. They had just been integrated into the list of invitees. There was also a mandate from the High Level Meeting on Least-Developed Countries that they should give priority to least-developed countries and they had done so.                 They supported wholeheartedly the WT/COMTD/M/29 Page 30 Director-General's proposal which would reduce the fellowship cycle to one year. It depended on the willingness of the Members to provide the necessary funding. They had taken note of all the proposals and recommendations.","WTCOMTDM29.pdf","Secretariat, Members, WTO, GATT, WTO, Chile, Venezuela, WTO, Director-General, Members"

The representative of Ecuador, as an ex-participant, said that many of the trade negotiators were bureaucrats with high qualifications but their interaction with the private sector was very limited.

It was very useful to see the administration and the management of private firms, be they big ones or SMEs, including in the field of electronic commerce.

Many of their participants were afterwards based either in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Trade or in the mission in Geneva. The importance attached to the Trade Policy Courses was demonstrated by the large number of applications: there were 300 applications from 150 countries for the course. It was important to enable developing countries to participate effectively in the world trading system. The Trade Policy Course was one of the core elements of the technical assistance and capacity building programme, helping developing countries better integrate into the multilateral trading system. The importance of avoiding duplication had already been mentioned. Every Member was offered one fellowship every two years. One could take advantage of impartial trade-related courses offered at other institutions and countries. The possibility of offering courses at the regional level could also be explored.","WTCOMTDM29.pdf","Mauritius, Ministry, of, Foreign, Affairs, Geneva, Member"

The representative of Senegal congratulated the Secretariat and he expressed his delegation's satisfaction with the interim evaluation for 1998-99, particularly for its comprehensive nature and pertinent recommendations. Firstly, he noted with interest the proposal for creating sub-regional centers of excellence by training the trainers. It was necessary to have the right synergy between the WTO and other international and regional institutions, the private sector and the beneficiary countries. In addition, the stability and predictability of enhanced technical assistance activities was of utmost importance. Furthermore, the difficulty of evaluating technical assistance activities in the Africa region had already been mentioned. The Secretariat needed to encourage Members and sub-regional organizations to identify their own programmes so as to avoid overlap. The main beneficiaries themselves did not always rationalize their own activities. Moreover, all manuals and teaching materials needed to be in three languages. Finally, they wished that their country could benefit from internships.

The course content was based on WTO work and also provided practical information on what was happening on the ground in other countries. Ex-participants from Uganda, with whom he had had the opportunity to interact in formulating position papers, played an active role in the Ministry of Trade and Industry. He differed with the delegate of Bangladesh regarding the effectiveness of the study tours. Judging from the experience of participants from Uganda, they were of the view that the trips provided an opportunity to gain practical, hands-on experience. He wondered how they might be made more effective rather than being eliminated. For that, one would need to look closely at the experience of the participants and the content provided. He wondered whether the shortening of the Trade Policy Courses from the original 6 months had had a negative impact on the course content.","WTCOMTDM29.pdf","Uganda, WTO, WTO, Uganda, Ministry, of, Trade, and, Industry, Bangladesh, Uganda"

The past evaluations of the programme were very positive. During the study tour in Canada, there would be sessions with the most knowledgeable trade policy officials in the federal government and also meetings with departments, other than foreign affairs and international trade, including the Department of Agriculture and the Canadian International Development Agency. There would also be visits to the private sector and meetings with representatives of two provincial governments. The programme did not allow for tourism activities, except for one day over the weekend. The study tours were meant to show participants how a specific country dealt with trade policy issues so that participants could observe concretely what they had learned. The Secretariat needed to make a thorough evaluation to ensure that money invested was providing a worthwhile experience. Her authorities would be interested in participating in the evaluation process.","WTCOMTDM29.pdf","Canada, WTO, Canada, Department, of, Agriculture, International, Development, Agency, Secretariat"

The representative of Turkey, as a one-time participant of the Trade Policy Course organized by the WTO, expressed his gratitude to the WTO and the staff of the Training Division for their efforts. The courses had always been beneficial for Turkish participants. They wished to see a continuation of the courses as well as their extension. The courses had not only provided practical knowledge about the WTO system but had also facilitated the opening of new horizons for better participation in world trade.","WTCOMTDM29.pdf","Turkey, Trade, Policy, Course, WTO, WTO, WTO"

Most of her predecessors as well as herself had benefitted from them. It was her delegation's great concern that demand for the courses could not be met by the Secretariat. Extra-budgetary resources needed to be explored to allow for wider participation. Her delegation welcomed the decision of the Director-General to explore the possibility of obtaining more resources WT/COMTD/M/29 Page 28 for the endeavour. With regard to the study tours, she found them to be very useful as it provided practical insights to how a Member had been implementing the WTO agreements. Certain delegations had genuine concerns as the anticipated results might not have been reached due to the shortness of the programmes. But Members needed to give a second thought with regard to the termination of the study tours. Regarding course content, she was happy to hear that the Secretariat was establishing an alumni association, with which she wished to be associated. She would be happy to provide suggestions with regard to the improvement of the courses.","WTCOMTDM29.pdf","Sri, Lanka, Secretariat, Director-General, Member, WTO, Members, Secretariat"
"2478",2478,"136","136.     The representative of Barbados thanked the Secretariat for the informative and comprehensive report. Her country, which had been granted fellowships in the past, considered the Trade Policy Courses to be very useful and they looked forward to benefiting from the opportunity to participate in them in the future. She had taken note of the Secretariat commitment to offer at least one fellowship per Member or Observer over a two-year cycle. As a small economy, they had a significant need for technical assistance and their participation in capacity-building exercises, such as the trade policy course, contributed greatly to their economic development. Sometimes they found themselves in a dilemma: on the one hand, they needed to gain technical expertise; on the other hand, they experienced difficulties in releasing officials due to lack of human resources. Still, it did not mean that they were not going to take the fellowships they were offered. Regarding the diversity of trainees, she was of the view that the interaction between participants from developing countries and transition economies with different experiences, different origins could be very beneficial. However, the number of fellowships granted over a period of time should not be reduced as a result of the increase in the pool of invitees. The issue was related to the resources available in the budget.","WTCOMTDM29.pdf","Barbados, Secretariat, Secretariat, Member"
"2477",2477,"135","135.     The representative of Bangladesh said that his delegation found the Trade Policy Course to be an important and highly regarded component of technical assistance. They were glad to hear that the Director-General was trying to gather resources so that more opportunities would be available for training. On behalf of the LDCs and particularly of his country, he said that the differing needs of developing countries, LDCs and economies in transitions needed to be taken into account for a better allocation of resources. The fellowships needed to be awarded according to needs and not on a numerical basis. He suggested that training courses be held on the field as well. Some countries had fairly good institutes for their bureaucrats, providing training on various aspects of their internal governmental systems. If the faculty in those institutes were trained, they could in turn develop a module which could become part of the curriculum for the officials. Members as well as the Secretariat needed to insist on seeing that people who received training, either in Geneva or elsewhere, be posted in missions in Geneva. They were grateful to the countries which hosted study tours; however, the resources from donors could be better used for increasing the number of facilities and fellowships in Geneva for LDCs rather than for taking the participants out on short trips. He asked for clarification as to whether transition economies were benefitting from two channels of training, one through the trade policy courses and another through the training funded by the governments of the United States and Switzerland. He wondered whether separating the courses for LDCs and transition economies would be more useful for these two groups of countries. They appreciated the needs of transition economies; however, in view of the needs of LDCs, he asked that donors consider examining the whole situation so that money was well spent.","WTCOMTDM29.pdf","Bangladesh, Director-General, LDCs, Members, Secretariat, Geneva, Geneva, Geneva, United, States, Switzerland, LDCs"
"2476",2476,"134","134.     The representative of Venezuela wished to thank the Secretariat for the information presented, the details of which were provided in the comprehensive Secretariat Note on Training. The Days of Reflection would provide a good opportunity for further discussion. They appreciated the extraordinary support offered by the Secretariat in training activities. His delegation was one of the delegations that had benefitted from the courses regularly within the limits set for the equitable distribution of fellowships. In response to the Secretariat request to reply to a survey on where former participants of the courses were at the time, they had made an evaluation. It had shown that many of those officials had assumed important positions in trade policy decision-making and had participated in important trade negotiations, which demonstrated the importance of the courses offered. Still, the courses were not perfect and some improvements could be made. They needed to regularly take into account the changes taking place, not only in the framework of globalization, but also with respect to the requirements of the multilateral trade agreements. As the Secretariat Note stated, one of the fundamental objectives of the courses was to prepare officials for the administration of trade agreements. In addition, more attention needed to be paid to the level of knowledge and expertise of the participants. At times, there were junior officials in the courses along with officials which had experience in negotiations. It was important to ensure that the participants were of a similar level. Furthermore, the participants needed to come out with a strengthened conviction on the multilateral trading system and the liberalization process. They had noted that the dynamic of the courses was such that there was some discussion at the philosophical level, resulting in rhetorical conclusions about the utility of the multilateral trading system. It was important not to lose sight of the main objectives of the courses. Apart from being informed about the WTO Agreements, participants needed to be motivated about the importance of multilateral trade liberalization. At times, the participants entered too early into a philosophical discussion regarding the benefits of being signatories to multilateral trade agreements, before reaching a good understanding of what the process                                                                                   WT/COMTD/M/29                                                                                          Page 27 of trade liberalization meant and why the multilateral agreements were crucial for benefitting in the best manner possible from the process. With respect to the content of the courses, it was necessary to look at experiences elsewhere. In Venezuela, thanks to the support of the Secretariat, they had made an effort to see if they could succeed in having a multiplier effect to the WTO Trade Policy Courses through cooperation with a Venezuelan University. This could become a regular exercise where more universities would develop permanent modalities for training on WTO-related issues. Such an effort would help in overcoming difficulties arising from limitations on time and budget. Special training centres could be established in cooperation with important universities in all regions of the world in order to reach out to a wider audience. It would provide those in the government and in the private sector, who could not participate in the courses in Geneva, with an opportunity to learn about important WTO issues.","WTCOMTDM29.pdf","Venezuela, Secretariat, Secretariat, Secretariat, Secretariat, Secretariat, WTO, Venezuela, Secretariat, WTO, Trade, Policy, Courses, Venezuelan, University, Geneva, WTO"
"2475",2475,"133","133.     The representative of Chile thanked the WTO and the Training Division for the opportunities his country had been given to send officials to the training courses. In fact, two officials were completing the most recent course in Spanish. They appreciated the fact that the Training Division was continuously updating and improving the curriculum in line with developments in the WTO. For example, that year training in agriculture and services sectors had been reinforced.. The follow-up to the courses was also very crucial as it gave the Secretariat an indication of which activities ex-participants were involved in. In responding to the WTO questionnaire, they had investigated and found out that in Chile many of the ex-participants, including one from the class of 1956, were working in the field of trade policy. Still, they had some comments and suggestions on how to improve the courses. There seemed to be a lack of coordination between similar activities undertaken at the WTO. For example, during the course of the latest three-month course in Spanish, there was a two-day seminar on GATS, an implementation seminar, and a dispute settlement course organized by the University of Geneva, in all of which the trade policy course participants could have participated. It might be a good idea to negotiate with the University of Geneva so that the participants could take advantage of the three-day course on dispute settlement. Study tours were regarded by some as superfluous trips, including touristic activities, which took away time from other activities and cost a significant amount. They wondered if the trips fulfilled the objectives of the courses and asked for a more detailed study regarding the effectiveness of the trips.","WTCOMTDM29.pdf","Chile, WTO, WTO, Secretariat, WTO, Chile, WTO, University, of, Geneva, University, of, Geneva"
"2474",2474,"132","132.     The representative of the Secretariat wished to correct an oversight in the report on training and offered, on behalf of the Secretariat, most sincere thanks to the Governments of Austria, Italy, Norway, Finland, Spain and Canada for having organized and hosted study tours for trainees. The study tour in Spain had just been completed and the one in Canada would take place in the fall of that year. He also thanked Switzerland for regularly hosting all groups of participants in Bern and for financing consultants for workshops on trade negotiating skills as well as courses for economies in transition. The summary account of the content of the courses found in the report gave a fair and accurate picture of the activities carried out during each course. He emphasized that the full programme was compulsory for the participants, although some flexibility could be applied in special circumstances. Much attention was devoted to the consistency and relevance of the programme as a whole. Delegations were not supposed to make use of trainees for official extra-curricular tasks and involve them in the regular activities of the WTO. In accordance with the internal rules of the fellowship programme, the trainees needed to devote all their official time to the courses. Starting with the previous course in 1999, a new feature of the selection process had been to include the economies in transition in the list of invited governments. For several years they had not been invited since they had benefited from the special six-week courses financed by Switzerland and the United States. As a result of the change in the type of assistance provided by the Swiss and US authorities, it was decided to include those beneficiary countries in the framework of the regular residential three-month courses. It had resulted in a much keener competition for the scarce number of fellowships each year. The implication for the countries involved was that they were subject to a different, less automatic selection process by the Secretariat as opposed to the one by the sponsoring countries in the earlier courses. Three years earlier, it had been decided to discontinue the practice of inviting applicants from the secretariats of regional organizations because of the large backlog of countries seeking participation in the courses. The only modification to that practice was that they allowed participation of self-financed candidates from those secretariats, thereby not depriving WTO Members or Observers of the few valuable fellowships. On course delivery and program assessment, the report described in some detail the delivery aspects of the courses as well as the efforts undertaken to assess their impact on the participants. They had completed in less than a year the preparation of a rather voluminous training manual. While the manual drew to a large extent from the Technical Cooperation Division's Training Package already available on the WTO Web-site, it had been complemented by reading lists represented in a user-friendly format. It was available in the three languages of the WTO and was distributed to all the course participants. Their intention was to make it available more generally, including on the WTO web-site, once the on-going in house verification had been completed. They hoped that it would provide a useful tool to delegations and capitals as well as to other interested readers. As to the follow-up and contact after the completion of the courses, the evaluation of the courses in Geneva was fairly advanced and elaborate. There was a need to improve the post-course evaluation by governments and participants themselves in capitals, which required closer cooperation from governments concerned. Their recent attempts in this regard had not yielded all the expected results. Indeed only about seventy percent of the ex-course participants' authorities had replied to their communication seeking to update their information as to the current location and job of their nationals. Information about assignments upon return and improvements back on the job would provide a better idea of the impact of the training received. They were thankful to those delegations which had submitted all the relevant information. They would be reviving, most likely in the autumn, the alumni association in Geneva. It was very comforting to the Secretariat to see so many ex-participants of the courses present in Geneva in various capacities. However, they were often unaware of others who had shared a common background with them and with whom they could exchange ideas in the framework of an alumni forum. The Secretariat would be contacting the ex-participants in the near future. Since mid-1999, up to 50 countries where Reference Centers had been installed had participated in the courses. Participants from those countries had been offered, as part of the curriculum, extensive computer training directly related to the use of the centers in their capital. A number of Reference Centers also WT/COMTD/M/29 Page 26 had a former participant in a training course as the person-in-charge. Updating the figures provided in the report on the total number of participants to the courses thus far, he said that the most recent figure was 1,757 (and not 1,702), including 90 self-financed auditors. Developing countries, least-developed countries and economies in transition shared the 144 fellowships and 36 auditor posts available over each two-year cycle, which guaranteed at least one fellowship to each applicant country or customs territory over that cycle. The proposal by the Director-General to double the training capacity would make it possible to ensure the same frequency of participation but over one-year cycles, instead of two, thus providing a meaningful improvement. This important initiative was being pursued by the Director General in the context of the preparation of the budget for 2001.","WTCOMTDM29.pdf","Secretariat, Secretariat, Austria, Italy, Norway, Finland, Spain, Canada, Spain, Canada, Switzerland, Bern, WTO, Switzerland, United, States, US, Secretariat, WTO, Members, Technical, Cooperation, Division, WTO, WTO, WTO, Geneva, Geneva, Secretariat, Geneva, Secretariat, Reference, Centers, Reference, Centers, Director-General, Director"

Responding to Switzerland's comments relating to budgetary and financial aspects, Mr. Aboutahir noted that there were different ways of drawing up these reports; financial and budgetary aspects had been included to give a better in-depth evaluation of technical cooperation activities in relation to financing. If the CTD decided that financial aspects should not be included, the Secretariat would comply. He also said that the Secretariat would try to identify a specific programme every year, and make a more in-depth evaluation, if the CTD so decided.

"2472",2472,"130","130.     Mr. Aboutahir also agreed with the Australian delegation regarding the way in which new training material and its pedagogical aspects should be introduced. Reflection would continue within the Technical Cooperation Division and with other Divisions in order to achieve better adaptation of this material. The idea was to adapt the material to the level of understanding and development of beneficiaries and to target groups, namely the final users of these training packages. He had noted the EC's comment concerning changes to the structure of the report. Future reports would be better targeted. An attempt would also be made to make them shorter. On the EC's question concerning substance and in particular regarding negotiation techniques, he agreed that this subject fell under the competence of UNCTAD. However, the WTO, while being neutral, had long and extensive experience in negotiating techniques. WTO also had databases that UNCTAD did not have, which could be of technical help to the developing countries helping them to negotiate better. One conclusion that could emerge was that UNCTAD and WTO should cooperate closely, each on the aspect where it had comparative advantage, to help developing countries to negotiate and thereby learn how to apply these negotiations to international trade and the WTO process. As for the private sector, the document suggested that there should be closer association of the private sector in the technical cooperation activities. From first responses, it was clear that the ""objectives and principles"" of the guidelines (WT/COMTD/8) should be also studied by the private sector, as a beneficiary.","WTCOMTDM29.pdf","Aboutahir, EC, EC, UNCTAD, WTO, WTO, UNCTAD, UNCTAD, WTO, WTO"

Mr. Aboutahir, replying to the discussion concerning the U.S. intervention and the degree of objectivity in the sampling of opinion, recalled that the report's methodology was used by all international organizations, namely, in the first stage to study the documentation, and second to analyze questionnaires. The third element was field visits. The Secretariat had tried to visit a maximum number of countries allowed by its human and financial resources; five countries was a number acceptable in other methods of evaluation carried out in other Organizations. The conclusions drawn were to be approved by the Committee. He noted that a certain degree of subjectivity would always exist in any evaluation report, since the evaluator, whether in-house, or external, would give his opinion and his interpretation. He noted that, in preparation of the report, the Secretariat had contacted a small number of missions. It would not be possible to contact all permanent missions unless the CTD asked the Secretariat to do so. He agreed with the United States that there was room for improvement of the questionnaire on technical assistance; and that the objectives should be identified before saying whether they had been achieved or not. The Secretariat would make changes based on all the comments received.","WTCOMTDM29.pdf","Aboutahir, U.S., Secretariat, Committee, Secretariat, CTD, Secretariat, United, States, Secretariat"
"2469",2469,"128","128.     The representative of Zambia commenting on the Interim Evaluation Report on Technical Cooperation; said that the report was a good basis to engage in a qualitative discussion of developments and the performance of technical cooperation activities. It drew attention to positive aspects, as well as some short-comings that the Secretariat should address. The recommendations should contribute to making technical cooperation a better instrument for the integration of developing economies into the Multilateral Trading System. He suggested that technical cooperation should be reviewed and extended beyond its current form. This included not only WTO technical cooperation but also the whole context of technical cooperation in the area of trade and development undertaken by different organizations such as UNCTAD, UNDP and the World Bank. The WTO should exploit its comparative advantage, i.e its knowledge of the Multilateral Trade Agreements while improving its complementarity with the technical cooperation provided by other organizations such as UNCTAD. WTO technical cooperation should focus on giving support to the establishment of the legal and technical infrastructure required to fulfil the obligations and to take advantage of the rights embedded in the Agreements. He recalled that the WTO Decision on Measures in Favour of Least-Developed Countries stated that least-developed countries would be provided substantially increased technical assistance in the development, strengthening and diversification of their capacity for production and exports. In this regard, he commended the EC and U.S. for their support to technical assistance and two proposals on improving technical cooperation in WTO for capacity- building. While WTO technical cooperation targeted in the first place governments' capacity to participate in WTO activities and negotiations and to comply with the Multilateral Trade Agreements, the private sector was supposed to be targeted by ITC Technical Cooperation. He mentioned one aspect of technical cooperation for the private sector that current efforts did not include, namely, the private sector's interests in the Dispute Settlement Mechanism. He noted that technical cooperation WT/COMTD/M/29 Page 24 should be both a target and an instrument that ensures efficiency, credibility and ownership. Training of trainers and capacity-building of national institutions was critical. Local participation should also involve, for instance, the local media which needed to understand the challenges raised by participation in the WTO in order to disseminate accurate information to the public. A key issue was active involvement in the design and implementation of WTO technical cooperation. Technical cooperation could also provide support to the articulation between the regional trade agreements and multilateral rules. Donor assistance was invaluable to enhance the competitiveness of LDC economies by supporting enterprise development in particular by facilitating access to new technologies.","WTCOMTDM29.pdf","Zambia, Secretariat, WTO, UNCTAD, UNDP, World, Bank, WTO, UNCTAD, WTO, WTO, EC, U.S., WTO, WTO, WTO, ITC, Technical, Cooperation, WTO, WTO"

The representative of Switzerland suggested that, as a next step, areas of technical assistance could be singled out and evaluated in detail, for instance, technical assistance in the dispute settlement area.

Such a detailed evaluation could be an example for how to proceed in other areas of evaluation on technical assistance and how to improve the report as a whole.","WTCOMTDM29.pdf","Switzerland"
"2463",2463,"122","122.     The representative of Switzerland said that the interim evaluation report was a good start, even though greater focus on the evaluation would be necessary. There was too much emphasis on description and too little in terms of evaluation. In addition, he questioned whether lengthy explanations on the budgetary and financing problems belonged in such a report, even though they were important. Third, while nobody could deny that technical assistance was an integral part of WTO, it should not be the purpose of an evaluation report to state this. An evaluation report should look at the way actual technical assistance was provided, whether it was effective, and not on whether technical assistance was important or not. Although the interim report was a start, a lot more work was needed, certain problematic areas had to be singled out and evaluated more in depth and some general recommendations would have to be further worked on in order to allow improvement; for instance, the recommendation to strengthen cooperation with relevant international organizations. In a final report, areas where this could be feasible would have to be described, as well as the way such                                                                                      WT/COMTD/M/29                                                                                             Page 23 cooperation with other organizations could be carried out.

The EC would want their experts in the development field to look at the documents and might come back with more substantive comment at some stage. Commenting on WT/COMTD/W/72, he was happy that it was an interim evaluation report which could give a chance to take on board suggestions and comments by Members, to improve the document. He found the paper somewhat confusing: it was not clear where information ended and analysis began. He also found it confusing that the recommendations were spread out throughout the document, leading to a ""shopping list"" in which it was not very clear what the linkages were with the various parts of the analytical work of the report. Some streamlining could be done. He asked the Secretariat to shorten the report and bring it closer to WT/COMTD/W/73 and W/74. Commenting on some of the recommendations, he noted the emphasis laid on the question of negotiating techniques (point 10). He questioned whether this was a core WTO activity or whether it should be left to UNCTAD. Regarding point 12, he felt it was not clear what the ""involvement of the media"" mean in promoting the image and profile of WTO. Point 13 referred to the private sector and key players; he noted that there was a discussion of voluntary contributions from the private sector in progress. He would therefore suggest some caution in taking up such a recommendation at this point.","WTCOMTDM29.pdf","European, Communities, EC, Members, Secretariat, WTO, UNCTAD, WTO"
"2461",2461,"120","120.    Two issues deserving more detailed consideration were, first, how to ensure the durability of technical cooperation activities and second, how to strengthen the synergies between the WTO's technical assistance and efforts taken by other organizations, bilateral donors and the beneficiary countries themselves to strengthen trade-related capacities. One should not underestimate the challenge involved in building stronger trade-related capacity in many developing countries, particularly the least developed, nor the time that this might take. A key factor might be enhancing domestic ownership through ensuring appropriate and adequately resourced domestic partners able to play an active role in identifying needs, helping design programmes and ensuring follow-up. Another important issue might be to recognize that short-term training programmes and missions might be of limited use if they were not adequately integrated into a longer-term strategic approach to developing capacity and appropriate skills. Three areas in which Australia was particularly interested were: how the WTO intended to enhance the effectiveness of its training packages, which currently were described as lacking an optimal pedagogical approach; how problems associated with the maintenance and use of the resource centres were being addressed; and the Secretariat's efforts to improve the programming of its activities. Australia would also be interested in advice on the training that WTO staff undergo in the use of the evaluation framework.","WTCOMTDM29.pdf","WTO, Australia, WTO, Secretariat, Australia, WTO"

He added that the League of Arab States sponsored activities that were against the core WTO principles of non-discrimination, and this was why Israel was not in a position to take a decision on the request made by the League of Arab States.","WTCOMTDM29.pdf","Israel, League, of, Arab, States, WTO, Israel, League, of, Arab, States"
"2459",2459,"119","119.    The representative of Australia welcomed the Secretariat's report as a very useful evaluation of WTO's technical assistance activities. In particular, she noted the comments regarding the lack of technical cooperation activities in the area of negotiating techniques. She announced that Australia was funding a two-week trade negotiations training course for African members of the Commonwealth, scheduled to take place in South Africa in late July and early August. The recommendations and lessons set out on pages 19 and 20 of document WT/COMTD/W/72 appeared sound, providing a realistic ""shopping list"" of actions for the WTO to enhance the delivery of technical assistance. Australia particularly agreed on the need for an adequate and predictable funding base and strengthened cooperation and coordination with other relevant organizations. Australia also supported the use of local partners, initiatives to enhance the ""demand-driven"" approach WT/COMTD/M/29 Page 22 and the promotion of a culture of evaluation within the WTO and beneficiary countries. Australia considered that the documentation provided a good basis for careful reflection by the CTD on ways to strengthen the WTO's involvement in technical cooperation activities. It was important that the CTD should ensure full discussion of these issues and that appropriate follow-up action was initiated.","WTCOMTDM29.pdf","Australia, Secretariat, WTO, Australia, Commonwealth, South, Africa, WTO, Australia, Australia, WTO, Australia, CTD, WTO, CTD"
"2458",2458,"118","118.     The United States representative also noted that in the ""Days of Reflection"" her delegation would have more to say on bilateral technical cooperation, because, regardless of the sources of funding and other resources, when providing bilateral technical assistance, Members needed to have a full picture of resources available, not only those from the WTO, but also from recognized institutions that worked with the WTO. She cited U.S. funding for a WTO project in Egypt; the United States would document more thoroughly the different projects in which it was involved and the amounts it was spending, but this would not foreclose U.S. interests in contributing to the WTO Trust Fund and other relevant projects that came under the WTO itself.","WTCOMTDM29.pdf","United, States, Members, WTO, WTO, U.S., WTO, Egypt, United, States, U.S., WTO, Trust, Fund, WTO"
"2457",2457,"117","117.     Concerning WT/COMTD/W/73, the United States wholly supported the concept highlighted regarding the culture of evaluation and would like to see it elaborated further. Commenting on the technical mission feedback form, she noted that the second element spoke of whether or not objectives were met but did not ask what the objectives were. The United States considered that should come before the question of whether objectives were met. She also asked whether there was provision for advance written agreements between the Secretariat and the recipients on the needs, that is, the objectives of the assistance? The United States believed that such a process was vital, not only for the delivery of assistance, but also for the evaluation of its delivery and effectiveness. Concerning reporting to the Committee, she considered that the proposed process would convey information in a useful way. The United States might also like to elaborate further, during the ""Days of Reflection"" on some of the questionnaires that had been presented at this meeting.","WTCOMTDM29.pdf","United, States, United, States, Secretariat, United, States, Committee, United, States"
"2456",2456,"116","116.    The representative of the United States appreciated the presentation, but recognized that document WT/COMTD/W/72 was an interim report. She asked whether the developing country Members who had participated in the interviews felt that it accurately reflected their views. She noticed that five countries were interviewed either in the capitals or at the Mission in Geneva. It was hard to tell whether some of the views expressed represented five or only some of the countries that were interviewed in Geneva, and therefore to get a clear idea quantitatively what views were represented in the report. She also asked if, in the context of perhaps the ""days of reflection"" or an informal discussion, a better idea could be gained from the individual countries of what they thought about the evaluation and its recommendations. She noted that in some areas there were very positive suggestions; but stated that her capital was not so sure of the level of objectivity. The vews of delegations that had contributed to the report would assist in assessing the objectivity of the report.","WTCOMTDM29.pdf","United, States, Members, Geneva, Geneva"
"2455",2455,"115","115.     In conclusion, Mr. Aboutahir recalled that less than ten per cent of technical assistance activities were financed by the regular budget, with the other 90 per cent through voluntary contributions. On this inadequate and unforeseeable basis, technical cooperation activities will certainly continue to suffer on several fronts. The Secretariat was now trying to do better with its present means, but a more solid basis for financing would certainly help the Secretariat carry out improvements. A balance between the regular budget, extra-budgetary resources of Members, and resources from regional institutions should be encouraged. Several of the ideas contained in the report could not be fully implemented if human and financial resources were not put at the disposal of the Secretariat.","WTCOMTDM29.pdf","Aboutahir, Secretariat, Secretariat, Members, Secretariat"
"2454",2454,"114","114.    Use of WTO Reference Centres was reported as very high. However, approximately one-third of the Reference Centres were not operational for a whole set of reasons; for example, connection cost and a number of other reasons contained in the report. The assessment of impact had focused on Africa and revealed a number of positive indicators, namely better access to information and increased requests for detailed information after each activity. It appeared that the message was passing successfully. On-line contacts had also increased through the establishment of Reference Centres. There had been great interest on the part of African countries on participation in the WTO system, and particularly in technical cooperation activities with WTO. However, few participants could manipulate databases, a very important element if they were to negotiate new rules and take advantage of WTO systems. It was suggested that the Secretariat could do more in this area. Concerning the use of consultants, the Secretariat was told that it would be advisable to resort to national/regional competence alongside international experts. In this way, sometimes the message could be transmitted more rapidly and could sometimes contribute to efficiency and to the saving of resources.

"2453",2453,"113","113.      Concerning training, it was noted that the ""training of trainers"" approach should certainly have priority because of its multiplier effect. This is an approach which most other international organizations use. It was suggested that WTO should try to set up trainers' networks in order to ensure a solid basis for the transfer of knowledge. The Secretariat was also told that in certain cases its training material was not well adapted to the needs of participants. Mr. Aboutahir suggested that WTO should consider dividing the content of this material into two or three levels so that participants can be better targeted.","WTCOMTDM29.pdf","WTO, Secretariat, Aboutahir, WTO"
"2452",2452,"112","112.    Mr. Aboutahir said that he had been told on repeated occasions that many developing countries, and particularly African countries, were not in a position to participate fully in the WTO system. They could not even manage better implementation without an ability to negotiate rules and without the possibility of participating in the decision-making process.","WTCOMTDM29.pdf","Aboutahir, WTO"
"2451",2451,"111","111.    Mr. Aboutahir stated that, during the process of the interim evaluation, drawbacks were pointed out by a number of delegations particularly in terms of programming. Integrated programming should normally secure logical links between activities, clarify activities for a given period and identify the evaluation indicators and the basis for monitoring. At present, the implementation of technical assistance activities was basically carried out on an ad hoc basis. Concerning the content of activities, a number of fundamental elements appeared to be missing in the eyes of developing countries and economies in transition, such as evaluation of the use of funds and mechanisms. A full understanding of the WTO rules was not enough to ensure the possibilities of taking advantage of the WTO system; more emphasis should be put on practical means of applying the rules and mechanisms. In addition, it was suggested that technical assistance should provide greater support for a number of concrete and specific tasks; an example was the method of drafting laws and establishing technical regulations relating to a number of Agreements. New issues arising from the Singapore programme, and training in techniques of negotiation, should also have a place in the WTO's activities.","WTCOMTDM29.pdf","Aboutahir, WTO, WTO, Singapore, WTO"
"2450",2450,"110","110.     Lastly, Mr. Aboutahir presented the interim evaluation report (WT/COMTD/W/72). This kind of interim evaluation of technical assistance was a first attempt. It should be further developed and improved following Members' suggestions at the meeting and through contacts with representatives of beneficiary countries in Geneva and in the capitals. The aim of the report was to provide the CTD with an evaluation of the relevance and performance of technical cooperation activities and to try to measure the impact of technical cooperation activities on beneficiaries. The report also proposed a number of recommendations aiming at improving the content and format of WTO's technical assistance. Mr. Aboutahir emphasized that all the information in the report reflected the opinions of beneficiaries both in their capitals and in Geneva on the technical cooperation activities conducted, and was also based on the questionnaires that participants fill out after each activity. As far as possible, the Secretariat had used the instruments proposed in document WT/COMTD/M/29 Page 20 WT/COMTD/W/73. In a number of cases, in particular on impact measurement, this report did not draw definite or final conclusions, because impact could only be measured over a long period, the evaluation process was in a very preliminary stage and a number of tools were just being developed. The methodology used was an analysis of documentation given by the technical assistance lecturer/official, as well as contacts with various officials from the Secretariat. At the second stage, field visits were made to beneficiary countries; the final stage was an analysis of questionnaires filled out by participants in technical assistance activities, by according to a random sampling, so that the questionnaires could be analysed in-depth.","WTCOMTDM29.pdf","Aboutahir, Members, Geneva, CTD, WTO, Aboutahir, Geneva, Secretariat, Secretariat"

The Chairman said that, while it was true that discussions were on-going in the General Council regarding Observer Status, subsidiary bodies and committees had the authority to consider applications submitted to them.

He therefore asked the representative of Israel whether his delegation had an objection to granting the League of Arab States ad hoc Observer Status to the CTD.","WTCOMTDM29.pdf","Chairman, General, Council, Observer, Status, CTD, Israel, CTD"
"2448",2448,"109","109.    Document WT/COMTD/W/74, the Manual for Technical Cooperation, was a tool that could be used in the first stage in the process of monitoring and evaluation. The objective was to contribute to developing an evaluation culture in the Secretariat. Page 19 of the document contained a number of indicators directly connected to technical assistance objectives. The list was not exhaustive but was a set of examples, giving an indicative list of possible indicators, which could be elaborated in collaboration with beneficiaries.","WTCOMTDM29.pdf","Manual, for, Technical, Cooperation, Secretariat"
"2447",2447,"108","108.     Introducing documents WT/COMTDW/72, W/73 and W/74, Mr. Aboutahir said that WT/COMTD/W73, in proposing a framework for evaluation of WTO technical assistance, put forward an approach and tool which the WTO Secretariat could use to assist and support the Committee in its evaluation and monitoring activities. The objectives of monitoring and evaluation were threefold: first, to evaluate the performance of technical assistance activities; second, to contribute to improving the content and format of technical assistance; and, third, to optimize the use of resources. The scope of the evaluation proposed by the framework related to: (i) individual activities, evaluated through questionnaires circulated to participants at the end of each event; (ii) regional projects and programmes in which WTO participated actively; (iii) specific topics, such as notifications or customs valuation, to evaluate for each subject the relevance of technical cooperation activities; and (iv) activities as a whole, where technical assistance could be assessed through their impact by region and by subject. The scope of monitoring and evaluation had three dimensions: the relevance of the activities, namely, whether or not they met the needs of beneficiaries and how WTO used its comparative advantage vis-à-vis other organizations; performance, particularly the effectiveness and efficiency of activities (reaching the best possible result with the least possible cost) and impact on beneficiaries, measured by indicators which should be identified in the planning phase. Mr. Aboutahir stated that the framework presented had suggested a number of concrete indicators relating to WTO's technical assistance activities. To give structure and analysis to this framework, it was proposed to use a matrix, as shown in the document. He emphasized that the process would only be successful when the direct beneficiaries of technical assistance as well as the donors are involved.","WTCOMTDM29.pdf","Aboutahir, WTO, WTO, Secretariat, Committee, WTO, WTO, Aboutahir, WTO"
"2446",2446,"107","107.     Mr. Léger took note that some Members felt that the report was too quantitative in nature and not enough in terms of quality of activities conducted. A decision had been taken a few months earlier to separate the Evaluation Report (WT/COMTD/W/72) from the Annual Report (WT/COMTDW/70), The evaluation report was based on two questionnaires discussed in 1999 in the CTD, and follow-ups with numerous countries. Mr. H. Aboutahir of the Technical Cooperation Division (TCD) would present the interim evaluation report. Additional information on individual missions by mode of delivery and subject matter, and money spent, was available in the Secretariat database and could be provided. The Secretariat could also provide tables on person-month inputs for each mission and how much of this was outsourcing. Concerning internal coordination, he stated that each request received for a technical assistance mission went through the TCD. No request was signed until the cost associated with the mission had been identified and the necessary funding provided. Information was gathered on the destination, names of the official(s), the number of days and the objective of the mission. This information, available in the database in TCD, was updated on a daily basis. He took note that the Committee wished to see in 2001, before reviewing the activities for 2000, the Secretariat's specific strategy, objectives and priorities so that Members could compare these against the results. Regarding outsourcing, he noted that the WTO was negotiating a number of MOUs with other organizations, including UN regional commissions. MOUs with the ECA, ESCWA, ESCAP, and others, had as their objective to assist WTO in organizing regional seminars whereby the regional bodies would undertake responsibility for logistics and administrative matters.

However, this also showed a lack in technical cooperation activities, because African countries were the least integrated in the multilateral trading system. He hoped that the report would help in carrying out an exhaustive examination to reorient technical assistance to be more centered on implementation, so that all elements in connection with the different Agreements concerning special and differential treatment became compulsory. Precise indicators should be provided to show the progress achieved by developing countries in their integration into the multilateral trading system.","WTCOMTDM29.pdf","Senegal, WTO, Africa"

It is not by coincidence that the only activity outside this framework was funded by the Swedish Trust Fund, and Kenya appreciated this extra-budgetary contribution.

The high proportion of activities of an ad hoc nature complicated planning. To the extent possible, requests for technical assistance should be made well in advance. Norway agreed that technical assistance should be demand-driven, but also believed that the Secretariat should seek to apply a more pro-active policy by informing potential beneficiaries of the existence, objectives and modes of delivery of its technical cooperation activities. It was important that these activities should be seen in a comprehensive context by beneficiaries, and not undertaken in isolation from other capacity building efforts of a more general developmental nature.","WTCOMTDM29.pdf","Norway, Norway, Secretariat"
"2439",2439,"100","100.     He also stated that WTO's comparative advantage in technical assistance was its detailed knowledge of the different Agreements and provisions of the multilateral trading system. However, he also appreciated that WTO recognized the need to work with the other relevant organizations and bilateral donors to integrate trade-related technical assistance in general development projects and programmes. In the introduction of the 1999 report, reference was made to the two questionnaires for evaluation and to the production of an evaluation report. This gave the impression that one intended to integrate a summary of different technical cooperation activities with an evaluation of results obtained. Norway would have welcomed this approach and requested the Secretariat to ensure that next time similar information was prepared for the CTD. He noted with interest that, in the section on Services, certain comments on the utility of different types of technical assistance had been included. He agreed that it was necessary to secure regular and stable access to financial resources for Secretariat activities; in Norway's opinion, the best way to achieve this would be to make technical cooperation activities part of the regular budget of the WTO. This would not exclude voluntary contributions, but would relieve the reliance on ad hoc financing. In addition to the regular budget and voluntary contributions, outsourcing of activities was a possibility. He sought an update on Memoranda of Understandings (MOUs) that had been signed with other bodies.","WTCOMTDM29.pdf","WTO, WTO, Norway, Secretariat, CTD, Secretariat, Norway, WTO"

SPECIAL AND DIFFERENTIAL TREATMENT: REPORT BY CHAIRPERSON ON SEMINAR HELD ON         7 MARCH 2000         Please find below the note prepared on the Seminar by the Chairperson.                                            _______________             Note on Seminar on Special and Differential Treatment for Developing Countries                                    held at WTO on 7 March 20001         The Seminar on Special and Differential Treatment for Developing Countries was held at the request of Members of the WTO Committee on Trade and Development (CTD). The objective was to explore different facets of special and differential treatment (S&D), outside of a negotiating context, and outside of a formal session of the CTD in order both to allow a frank exchange of views on the issue and to provide an input into the Committee's consideration of the question. Background material included WTO documents, material provided by other organizations and papers prepared by some panelists. A copy of the programme is attached.          The seminar was divided into six sessions: on the overview of S&D provisions in the WTO and their objectives; on the role of GSP and other preferences; on the function of technical assistance as an element in S&D; on the implementation of S&D under the main WTO Agreements; on the relationship between S&D treatment and developing country reforms; and finally, on the future of special and differential treatment.         During the first session, the panelists discussed the origins of S&D provisions and their evolution since the introduction of the first such provision in 1955. Waivers for non-reciprocal trading arrangements (e.g. Lomé, CBI, etc.), Generalized System of Trade Preferences (GSP), and the Enabling Clause were highlighted as having been some of the main initiatives over the years. It was pointed out that there had been a shift in attitudes towards S&D over time, especially between the Tokyo and the Uruguay Rounds. Some argued that the realization that S&D had not yielded many tangible results had led developing countries to accept a dilution of S&D provisions in return for improved market access to developed country markets. Others claimed that since existing S&D provisions were not legally enforceable and had not been properly put into effect, it was not possible         1             Job No. 1554. WT/COMTD/M/28/Add.1 Page 2 to determine whether S&D as a concept had succeeded or failed. In addition, it was argued, many possible S&D benefits had been outweighed by losses due to protectionist arrangements of developed countries in the agriculture and textiles sectors. Any evaluation or rethinking of S&D provisions needed to be addressed in its historical and political context, rather than in a purely legalistic manner. Apart from a discussion of existing S&D provisions, some called for new arrangements for small and vulnerable economies.          In the second session, it was argued that given the large and widening disparities in income levels between developed and developing economies and the higher levels of protection that still existed on items of export interest to the developing countries, GSP as well as other forms of preferential trade arrangements were still of major importance. In 1997 about $100 billion worth of imports into developed countries had benefitted from GSP schemes while levels of domestic and foreign direct investment in developing countries had in many regions remained insufficient to spur growth. Problems with GSP included the gradual erosion of preferences due to overall tariff liberalization as well as the complexity and unpredictability of the country schemes. Measures such as extending the scope of the schemes, relaxing their rules of origin, and complementing them with other supply-side policies were mentioned as means of improving the functioning of GSP. There was a clear trend towards reciprocal preferential trading arrangements between developed countries and developing countries and non-reciprocal ones between developed countries and LDCs. GSP would remain attractive for those countries which were not covered by these other schemes. Some participants in the seminar pointed out that one should not to be misled by aggregate results and figures but rather focus on particular needs of countries at different levels of development. For example, it was not LDCs but rather middle-income countries that stood to gain from GSP.         The third session opened with a review of the technical assistance (TA) activities of the WTO, which had expanded considerably since 1995 (from 79 activities in 1995 to 382 in 1999), and 90 per cent of which were now financed through extra-budgetary contributions. Not only had the number of activities per year increased but also the diversity of the subjects covered. Modes of assistance had varied from traditional national or regional seminars and workshops to more recent courses using IT-based training instruments. It was a commonly held view that the upcoming review of the technical assistance programme needed to address two main issues to enhance effectiveness: developing a coherent and systematic approach and securing a more predictable and sustainable financial base. Some participants in the seminar proposed that networks of regional groups, as well as contributions from recipient countries within the limits of their resources, could be used to facilitate TA activities. It was pointed out that TA was the least controversial of all S&D measures as it did not require any trade preferences or concessions. The objective was to assist developing countries in the implementation of the agreements they had already signed on to. Some argued that ""soft"" TA needed to be complemented by ""hard"" modes of assistance, such as trade-related infrastructure support. The Integrated Framework, which was meant to address some of these concerns, still had conceptual as well as coordination problems.          In the fourth session, it was stressed that, with the introduction of new rules for world trade under the Uruguay Round Agreements, the nature of S&D provisions had changed - from an emphasis on preferential market access and non-reciprocity to a greater focus on transition periods, transfer of technology, and capacity-building to assist developing countries in integration into the trading system. A number of participants said that S&D provisions must address, concretely, the difficulties faced by developing countries in integration - difficulties which might stem from such things as the size or trade sera of the country, administrative shortfalls including availability of trained personnel, or sectoral constraints. It was also argued that developing countries, being heterogeneous, did not necessarily fall into clearcut groups and that similar problems might overlap currently accepted categories of developing countries. Some participants also emphasised that, if S&D provisions were to be of value, they should be expressed in legally binding commitments, rather than in ambiguous terms as at present.                                                                                WT/COMTD/M/28/Add.1                                                                                             Page 3          In the fifth session, differing views on the adjustment process were expressed. On the one hand, economic reform and adjustment were necessary, essential conditions for economic growth and for successful integration into the world economy. It was suggested that S&D provisions had been counterproductive to the extent that they had delayed adjustment and encouraged the maintenance of policies that favoured the interests of narrow, special interest groups. On the other hand, others saw an need for policy flexibility in developing countries, given differences in economic conditions and endowments, as well as the existence of market failures that, in the absence of corrective action, could lead to misallocation of resources. Participants did not agree on the role of subsidies in the economy, whether as a spur to development or as a source of waste and inefficiency.          In the sixth and final session, some participants recalled the non-discriminatory basis of the multilateral trading system and recognized the tension between this principle and observed inequalities among WTO Members. Some believed that, rather than addressing these inequalities, the experience of S&D treatment was that it had increased them. Certain aspects of S&D, such as non-reciprocal preferences, had not been notably successful in all cases in promoting development and economic integration. The debate again turned around the questions of how S&D might be more closely calibrated to the situation of individual developing countries and how far policy flexibility could be a useful tool for promoting development. One major developed market Ambassador, as a panellist, outlined proposals that his delegation were considering for early action in the fields of market access for LDCs and capacity building for developing countries in general.

He said that development was a challenge that needed to be met collectively and collaboratively, within a context of shared goals and objectives. He noted the proposed work programme of the CTD reflected the need to give priority to critical issues such as technical assistance and implementation, and the need to enhance development possibilities and participation in world trade by responding to particular problems of developing countries. He expressed his hope that it would be possible to agree on the work programme for the CTD as soon as possible.

The representative of Norway responded to the question raised by the Philippines regarding criteria for inclusion in or exclusion from the list of beneficiary countries, and said that with very few exceptions, all developing countries and LDCs were on the list, regardless of their Membership status with the WTO. There were certain exceptions – such as Iran which, as he had stated earlier, had just been re-instated to the list – but these were limited to just one or two. Regarding the question raised by Mexico, he said that the present notification had also been submitted to the UNCTAD.

"2412",2412,"89","89.      The representative of Sri Lanka thanked the delegation of Norway for its notifications, and placed on record the appreciation of her delegation to the transparency this exercise generated. Her delegation had some preliminary questions. She recalled the Norwegian Scheme notified in 1995 did not recognise the principle of donor-country content rule, while Chapter 2 Section 2, appeared to identify the donor-country content rule. Further elaboration was required as to how the rule was to be effected, as it was known that other countries maintained a restricted list when applying the donor- country content rule. Regarding Section 4 which dealt with sufficiently worked or processed products, she said that there appeared to be a typographical error in the 2nd sentence of the 3rd paragraph which refered to a value of 5 percent, which was a very low level of value, whereas it should probably have read 35 or 50 percent. Regarding products not wholly obtained, her delegation had some concerns about rigidities in rules of origin, especially with regard to chapters 50 to 63 where many developing countries had comparative advantage. Regarding Section 6 on regional cumulation of origin, she requested clarification as to what regional groupings had been recognised under this section. On Section 11 regarding derogations, her delegation wished to flag the fact that                                                                                      WT/COMTD/M/28                                                                                             Page 21 waiving rules of origin of for certain groups of countries, while having some justification, could also lead to practices such as anti-circumvention.","WTCOMTDM28.pdf","Sri, Lanka, Norway"

He said that it was proper for all Members having a GSP scheme to inform the CTD about their respective GSP systems and modifications to it. In order to ensure coherence and consistency it would be necessary to examine at the start of each year what changes had been made to GSP schemes.

The representative of the Philippines expressed the appreciation of the Philippines to Norway in respect of its implementation of preferential market access through the GSP. He sought clarification as to the definition of ""GSP Country"" as referred to in Paragraph 12 of Chapter 1, which said that a GSP country "" refered to those beneficiary developing countries and territories, including at any given time, the list of countries published by the Norwegian customs authorities"". He wished to know whether all WTO developing countries were automatically included in the list, and if not, what criteria were used for inclusion or exclusion.","WTCOMTDM28.pdf","Philippines, Philippines, Norway, GSP, WTO"
"2409",2409,"86","86.      The representative of Norway said that Norway had notified its GSP scheme on 29 August 1995, and its notification was contained in WT/COMTD/N/6, which contained all regulations related to the Norwegian GSP scheme, including Rules of Origin provisions, product coverage lists and a country list. The present notification contained in WT/COMTD/N/6/Add.1 only contained new regulations concerning the origin of goods, and neither country lists nor product coverage was included.           He referred Members to paragraph 59(c) of the Document WT/COMTD/W/66, discussed under agenda item C, which contained a brief summary of Norway's GSP scheme, and which showed that Norway had a fairly liberal GSP scheme. He added that the Norwegian Parliament recently made some additional improvements to the GSP scheme which were not reflected in the present notification, as the modification had been made subsequent to the issue of the present notification in December 1999. The amendments were all improvements, and would be reflected in a further addendum submitted to the CTD. The first of these improvements was a substantial reduction in exceptions in product areas such as textiles, clothing and footwear. Second, country specific exceptions relating to Hong Kong, China; Macao, China; and South Korea had been lifted. The third improvement was with regard to countries eligible for GSP treatment, with the re-inclusion of Iran, which had been suspended for some years. The representative of Norway said that the second addendum to WT/COMTD/N/6 which would be circulated would cover all regulations related to the Norwegian GSP scheme, including product coverage and country lists.","WTCOMTDM28.pdf","Norway, Norway, Members, Norway, Norway, Parliament, CTD, Hong, Kong, China, Macao, China, South, Korea, GSP, Iran, Norway"

She requested that the CTD accept and take note of the dates that had been put forward for the 29th and 30th sessions of the CTD, respectively 29 June and 27 October 2000. Regarding the other aspects of the work programme, the Secretariat would take into account the comments that had been made by Members. Regarding the seminars, she requested that the one delegation awaiting instructions from its capital make every effort to obtain direction from its capital in order to allow the CTD to fix the dates of the seminars by the end of the month of March 2000, and to allow the CTD to adopt its work programme for the year 2000 in its entirety.","WTCOMTDM28.pdf","Chairperson, CTD, CTD, Secretariat, Members, CTD, CTD"
"2405",2405,"82","82.       The Director of the Development Division addressed the questions raised by some delegations regarding the timing of the 30th Session and other events taking place in October such as Geneva Week. He noted that October was a busy month, because it included meetings of Trade and Development Board of the UNCTAD, the final WTO General Council in which annual reports were to be delivered, and so forth. He therefore requested that the date of 27 October 2000 for the 30th Session be treated as indicative, whilst adding that the dates were reasonably accurate. He added that good note had been taken of the request made by Gabon regarding the Social Summit.","WTCOMTDM28.pdf","Director, Development, Division, Geneva, Week, Trade, and, Development, Board, UNCTAD, WTO, General, Council, Gabon"

"2403",2403,"80","80.      The representative of the United States said her delegation had reviewed the work plan submitted to January to Members, and said that her delegation's main concern was that the programme not be overloaded. The Secretariat had limited resources, and it was necessary to ensure that quality work was carried out in a timely fashion. In order to ensure that the work programme and the work products resulting there from were widely applicable and relevant to the discussions on-going in the organisation more broadly. For instance, her delegation was of the view that if there were issues raised concerning specific categories of developing countries, that similar consideration be given to other types of developing countries and given similar attention in the CTD as proposals raised by those concerned. On the issue of electronic commerce, the work plan was generated by the General Council, which had yet to respond to the reports submitted by the CTD and other bodies. While her delegation supported continued work on electronic commerce in the CTD, Members needed to be sensitive to proposals emanating from the General Council on this subject, in order to ensure that work that took place in the CTD facilitated the organisation of the work programme on electronic commerce, to be undertaken in May. Regarding the proposed schedule of seminars, her delegation needed to refer this matter to its capital, especially in relation to items scheduled from June onwards, and she hoped that feedback from capital would come expeditiously. Her delegation could not thus in the immediate go along with the schedule as proposed for the various seminars, though her delegation had no problem in principle with the seminars as an approach to deal with issues listed in the work programme. Her delegation could go along with the work programme, provided that various issues were managed in accordance with the resources of the Secretariat and with their the attention that they merited. The representative of the United States did not wish a return of the situation which had occurred with the Seminar on Special and Differential Treatment, where her hands had been tied whilst awaiting feedback from her capital, and her aim was to forward the proposed work programme to her capital to obtain feedback both regarding the dates and the contents of the various seminars.","WTCOMTDM28.pdf","United, States, Members, Secretariat, CTD, General, Council, CTD, CTD, Members, General, Council, CTD, Secretariat, United, States"

"2399",2399,"77","77.      The representative of Zambia recalled that under the previous agenda item, Members had discussed special and differential treatment, and its development or impact if used effectively. The Secretariat Report on the Participation of Developing Countries in International Trade had referred to the importance of building trade-related capacity as a key for improved trade, in particular for LDCs, and Members had expressed sympathy with the condition of the Developing Countries and LDCs. The question was, therefore, how to turn this sympathy into concrete and tangible results, for these countries to improve, qualitatively and quantitatively, their trading prospects and living conditions. He said that the proposal submitted by Zambia took Members one step from statements to suggested concrete measures. The essence of the Zambian proposal was to kick start the process of implementation of provisions related to technology transfer to developing countries (and particularly LDCs), which all members recognised to be at the heart of the process of integration though sustainable competitive advantage. He said that in order to compete effectively, products from developing countries needed technological content. However, technology transfer alone would not solve problems in this regard, and needed to be harmonised with capacity-building measures. He said that issues of special and differential treatment discussed in the seminar covered a broad spectrum of issues including technology transfer, and appeared in all aspects of WTO work. For all these reasons, Zambia wished to put technology transfer at the centre of WTO activities. The proposal envisaged that the WTO would need partner organisations such as those listed in the document that had been distributed. The proposal also assumed that implementation required a series of steps, such as: understanding what motivated technology owners to transfer technology; approaches to transfer of technology; incentives, and so forth. Implementation was not a one-off action, and each of the organisations listed could make a positive contribution and together, these organisations could create and deliver a mechanism linking technology owners to private sector owners. As to the procedure by which the proposal was to be handled, the representative of Zambia said that the CTD was an appropriate forum, particularly with a view to providing the political impetus. However, the ultimate and most appropriate forum was perhaps the TRIPs Council, and he informed Members that the same communication was being forwarded – with minor changes – to the TRIPs Council.","WTCOMTDM28.pdf","Zambia, Members, Secretariat, Participation, of, Developing, Countries, in, International, Trade, LDCs, Members, LDCs, Zambia, Members, WTO, Zambia, WTO, WTO, Zambia, CTD, Members"
"2398",2398,"76","76.     The Chairperson suggested that for the consideration of this item, the meeting move into informal mode to allow for a frank exchange of views off the record. On the basis of discussions, the meeting could ask the Secretariat to make some revisions to the draft programme during the day so that a programme could be adopted later in the day, if possible. However, before switching to informal mode, the Chairperson opened the floor to the representative of Zambia to introduce his paper.","WTCOMTDM28.pdf","Chairperson, Secretariat, Chairperson, Zambia"
"2397",2397,"75","75.      The Chairperson said that prior to the June meeting of the CTD, it may also be useful to have a seminar to discuss the problems of small economies, which was also on the Illustrative List. Considerable work had been done on this issue by the Commonwealth Secretariat and the World Bank, and by June it may be opportune to discuss the trade aspects of the issue. Such a seminar could be organized under the auspices of the CTD during the week of 26 June and a report provided for discussion in the CTD at its 29th Session. On the basis of discussions in the CTD and other bodies of the WTO, there also appeared to be considerable interest in the problems related to implementation of the WTO Agreements. If it was thought useful, it would also be possible to organize a seminar on this topic in the second half of 2000, to be followed by a report to the 30th Session of the CTD where the issue could be formally discussed. The idea was enter into specific details of implementation in the whole range of areas and discuss possible solutions to the difficulties WT/COMTD/M/28 Page 18 identified. Such a seminar was tentatively programmed for 23 October 2000. If desired, this could also be extended to cover other aspects of the participation of developing countries in world trade, and even capacity building, as indicated in the Illustrative List. The CTD also needed to adopt the annual report on its activities at the final formal meeting of the year. Prior to that meeting, the draft report might be discussed in an informal meeting which was proposed for 24 October 2000, just prior to the formal meeting. Although it was not formally part of the work of the CTD, the Director-General wished to hold another ""Geneva Week"" for non-resident Members in order to brief them on developments in the WTO and to facilitate their integration in the multilateral system. This was tentatively programmed for 16-20 October 2000, so that non-residents who so wish would be able to stay over for the meetings of the CTD and the implementation seminar in the week of 23 October 2000. (The arrangements for Geneva Week were be carried out by the staff of the Development Division and the Technical Co-operation Division). Other items on the Illustrative List could be addressed under Other Business, as required by dictates of urgency, or in the work programme for subsequent periods.","WTCOMTDM28.pdf","Chairperson, CTD, Commonwealth, Secretariat, World, Bank, CTD, CTD, CTD, WTO, WTO, CTD, CTD, CTD, Director-General, Members, WTO, CTD, Development, Division"
"2396",2396,"74","74.      The Chairperson recalled that, beyond matters on the agenda of the 28th session, the CTD was already committed to an evaluation of the Technical Assistance programmes of the Secretariat. This process had already begun through the preparation of two reports, one of a more quantitative nature similar to last year, summarizing the activities that had taken place in 1999 and that were envisaged for 2000, and a second report identifying an approach which would permit the evaluation of technical cooperation, including training, in a more qualitative manner, to be presented at the same time. It was envisaged that these two reports would be discussed at the 29th Session of the CTD proposed for the week beginning 26 June 2000. It was also expected that the report on the review of the Integrated Framework for Trade-related Technical Assistance to Least-developed Countries would be presented to the Sub-Committee on the Least-developed Countries and the report on consideration in the Sub-committee would then be referred to the CTD later in the year, possibly at the 30th Session, for which the proposed date is 27 October 2000.","WTCOMTDM28.pdf","Chairperson, CTD, Secretariat, CTD, Integrated, Framework, for, Trade-related, Technical, Assistance, CTD"
"2395",2395,"73","73.     The Chairperson said that Members had before them for their consideration a Secretariat paper entitled Proposed CTD Work Programme for 2000 (Job No. 1003, 17 February 2000) and a Communication From Zambia: Proposed Work Programme for the Year 2000 (WT/COMTD/W/67, 22 February). She recalled that the CTD had a number of formal and informal discussions on its work programme over the preceeding year. The most recent discussion had taken place in its informal session on 21 January 2000, on the basis of an informal note by the Secretariat, entitled ""Illustrative List of Elements for a Possible Work Programme"". This note attempted to consolidate under four headings various matters previously raised by Members and which fell within the scope of the existing terms of reference of the Committee. These four broad headings were: special and differential treatment; technical co-operation; participation of developing countries in the multilateral trading system; and the experience of the developing countries with their own implementation and the implementation by their partners of the WTO Agreements. During discussions on the Illustrative List, Members indicated that the list was relatively comprehensive and ambitious, and it would be necessary to establish work priorities for 2000, without necessarily excluding any item of interest to Members. She said that in preparing the draft work programme, account was taken of items to which the Committee was already committed for 2000 or for which work has been requested.","WTCOMTDM28.pdf","Chairperson, Members, Secretariat, Zambia, CTD, Secretariat, Members, Committee, WTO, Members, Members, Committee"

"2393",2393,"71","71.     The Chairperson was of the view that, after the discussion, the CTD understood better the recent evolution in the participation of developing countries in world trade. It was clear from the comments and questions that this issue needed to remain under discussion in the CTD. It would be wise to let some time pass before repeating the statistical analysis and revert to the question in the following year on the basis of updated data. Should there be important and rapid developments, it was always possible to revert to the matter sooner.","WTCOMTDM28.pdf","Chairperson, CTD, CTD"
"2392",2392,"70","70.      The Director of the Development Division thanked all delegations for their comments. He apologised to the francophone and hispanophone Members for the lack of translated documents. Referring to the comment made by the representative of Switzerland regarding South-South trade, he said that although it might not have been emphasized in the introduction, the sections on the structure of developing countries' trade and on regional developments included a lot of information on the different patterns and trends of South-South trade in Asia, Latin America and Africa. These could of course be analyzed more thoroughly next time. Referring to the comment made by the representative of Kenya about the apparent contradiction between paragraphs 12 and 59, he said that he did not see a contradiction. Paragraph 59 largely covered the expanding share of African exports to developing Asia in the period before the financial crisis, that is, up until 1997. The main effect of the financial crisis on Africa seemed to have been the decline in commodity prices, which had affected Africa's trade in a negative fashion.

The Chairperson recalled that at the 27th Session of the CTD, the League of Arab States had presented a request for Observer Status to the CTD, and that consideration of the request had been postponed to the 28th Session of the CTD. She wished to know whether the CTD was in a position to examine this request.","WTCOMTDM28.pdf","Chairperson, CTD, League, of, Arab, States, CTD, CTD, CTD"
"2390",2390,"69","69.      The representative of Australia thanked the Secretariat for the interesting analysis in particular for identifying significant factors and trends. Those economies which had diversified had gained a greater share of international trade, while most economies that had remained tied to exports of raw materials and agricultural products had generally lagged behind. It was notable that the financial crisis had a proportionately greater effect on the trade among developing countries than on the trade between developing and developed countries. This highlighted the interdependence between developing countries and the benefits they could accrue through joint initiative and action. They welcomed further activity by the Secretariat to identify important lessons and/or best practices.","WTCOMTDM28.pdf","Australia, Secretariat, Secretariat"
"2389",2389,"68","68.     The representative of Senegal said that he had not thus far fully examined the document, which they had received in English only. Referring to the question raised by India, he wondered why despite efforts, the benefits from liberalization were so small. There needed to be benefits for all Members. The representative of India was right in asking why some had gained more while efforts in the WTO were shared. These questions were even more pertinent since many countries were marginalized, limiting their capacities to implement the WTO Agreements let alone assume new obligations. There was a problem of credibility in the WTO, accompanying all the problems raised by India. Therefore, the CTD needed to continue consideration of the document at the next meeting.","WTCOMTDM28.pdf","Senegal, India, Members, India, WTO, WTO, WTO, India, CTD"
"2388",2388,"67","67.     The observer from the Organisation of African Unity said that his Organisation also monitored trade and other economic data on Africa. The results reported in the paper were fully consistent with what they had been observing, namely, the declining volume and value of African exports, the absence of change in the composition and destination of African exports and the dependence on commodities. What was not captured in the paper - and was perhaps unnecessary given the focus of the paper - was that they were not seeing much of a reversal under the improved policy climate in the nineties. In response to economic reforms, positive growth rates had been seen in African economies, but the trade patterns had not been reversed. These observations again highlighted the urgent need for greater coherence in the policies of external partners towards Africa in dealing with issues such as the lack of investment response or the supply and capacity constraints.","WTCOMTDM28.pdf","Organisation, of, African, Unity, Organisation, Africa, Africa"
"2387",2387,"66","66.     The representative of Kenya said that his observations would focus on Africa's performance in international trade. First, he noticed that Western Europe continued to be a major market for African exports, even if the share of exports going there had declined. He hoped that the ratification of the African Growth and Opportunity Act in the United States would help provide markets for African exports. Second, he noted some possible inconsistency between paragraphs 12 and 59, regarding the effects of the financial crisis on developing countries' trade. On the one hand, it was said that Africa and the Middle East were particularly affected by the decline in commodity prices. WT/COMTD/M/28 Page 16 On the other hand, there was an increase in the share of African exports going to Asia. He was of the view that this could possibly be attributed to African exports to countries that were not affected by the crisis, notably India and China. Thirdly, there was an increase in intra-African trade, which might be attributed to enhanced efforts on regional integration arrangements. He noted that the statistics were not coming out clearly because of the exclusion of South Africa, both on the import and export side. South Africa was a dominant and major partner in Africa both in terms of investment and trade. More accurate figures could be attained by including South Africa in African trade. Finally, regarding the predominance of primary commodities in African exports, as noted by the Ambassador of Uganda, he was not sure whether it could be explained through weak supply-side capacity or tariff escalation and tariff peaks.","WTCOMTDM28.pdf","Kenya, Africa, Western, Europe, United, States, Africa, Middle, East, Asia, India, China, South, Africa, South, Africa, Africa, South, Africa, Ambassador, Uganda"
"2386",2386,"65","65.     The representative of Hong Kong, China thanked the Secretariat for the good and comprehensive paper, which would help her delegation in the consideration of the matter. She believed that the paper was an update on an earlier version that had been discussed earlier. At that point, her delegation had commented that it would be useful to analyse the effects of regional trade agreements on the trade of developing countries. The erosion of preferences for developing countries due to the elimination of tariffs among parties to regional trade agreements was certainly an important factor affecting the trade of developing countries. She took note of the explanation by the representative of the Secretariat that the focus of the update was more on the Asian financial crisis. They hoped that their comments would be taken into account when the paper was updated again in the future.","WTCOMTDM28.pdf","Hong, Kong, China, Secretariat, Secretariat"
"2385",2385,"64","64.      The representative of Cuba said that the participation of developing countries in world trade needed to be the centre of discussions in the CTD and that this subject was of utmost importance for his delegation. The objective was to see whether developing countries were actually progressing in their participation in world trade. Unfortunately, he had received the Secretariat document just that day and only in English, which was not very useful since his delegation worked in Spanish. He shared the views expressed by India, Bangladesh, and others that, as shown in Chart 1 on page 4, from 1948 and 1998, the share of developing countries in exports of manufactures had remained the same, meaning there had been no progress. He wondered what needed to be done to ensure that this would be changed. Paragraph 4 stated that those countries which were successful in the diversification of their economies were those which had gained more participation at the regional or national level. He wished that this matter be discussed in greater detail to be helpful for the future. Paragraph 11 stated that the developing countries which had been able to take advantage of liberalisation trends in the eighties and the nineties were also those whose development had progressed rapidly. This also needed further discussion, but he was waiting for comments from his capital. He agreed with the comments made by the representative of Uganda that the matter be taken up again in the future and supported the recommendation made by one delegation for the study to include developing countries' participation in international trade in services, which was a very significant sector in some economies.","WTCOMTDM28.pdf","Cuba, CTD, Secretariat, India, Bangladesh, Uganda"
"2384",2384,"63","63.     The representative of Japan thanked the Secretariat for having prepared an excellent, comprehensive note. Her delegation paid particular attention in the note to the fact that the LDC's share of world trade had declined from 0.9 per cent in 1980 to 0.5 per cent in 1997. This was partly due to their dependence on primary commodities. Among LDCs, the gap had become larger between those which exported manufactures and others. Her delegation was concerned that LDCs might be further marginalized as globalization progressed. In this regard they recognized the importance of various measures and assistance, including technical assistance, in favor of developing countries, in particular LDCs.","WTCOMTDM28.pdf","Japan, Secretariat, LDC"
"2383",2383,"62","62.      The representative of Mauritius said that he shared the views expressed by the representatives of India and Jamaica and also agreed with the representative of Uganda on the question related to primary commodities. In the case of very small states, dependent on exports of commodities or traditional products, diversification might not be possible due to physical size and climate. On the other hand, these same products had helped the diversification in some countries into other sectors like tourism and textiles, and this process had been achieved prior to the signing of the Marrakesh Agreement.","WTCOMTDM28.pdf","Mauritius, India, Jamaica, Uganda"
"2382",2382,"61","61.      The representative of Jamaica was of the view that one of the most important statistics provided was the one indicating growth in merchandise exports over the past fifty years, which had increased by a factor of 69 for developing countries and by a factor of 100 for developed countries. Over time, merchandise exports of developed countries were in fact increasing at a faster rate than that of developing countries. Therefore, it could only be concluded that the gap between developed and developing countries was widening and not closing - an important conclusion to draw from the mass of data that they had been provided with. He thanked the Secretariat for the comprehensive and informative document. On the positive side, the share of manufactures in exports of developing countries, had risen from 4 per cent to 24 per cent between 1963 and 1998. If there was any correlation to be made, it was between growth in manufactures as a proportion of exports and rise in incomes and a more successful integration into the global economy. Still it needed to be placed in the right context. A small number of countries including China, which was not a WTO Member as yet, accounted for almost 70 per cent of the exports of manufactures from developing countries. Another positive development was the tendency towards stronger integration in terms of South-South trade. Particularly in Latin America, intra-regional trade in MERCOSUR and the Andean Community had grown by rates as high as 26 per cent per year between 1990-97. He did not believe that similar figures would have been applicable to some of the other regional arrangements in Latin America and the Caribbean, including CARICOM. Still, it was a healthy trend, reflective of efforts to strengthen South-South cooperation. The data also showed positive trends in the growth of imports from developed countries. Market access to developing countries appeared to be quite attainable for developed countries. In conclusion, there were some positive trends, but despite the best efforts of all concerned, there was in fact a widening of the gap.

"2381",2381,"60","60.     The representative of Uganda said that it was very clear from the statistics that the share of world trade for LDCs, particularly for those in Africa, had been declining. As highlighted in paragraphs 7 and 63, the other problematic aspect concerning especially African LDCs was the predominance of primary commodities as a major export item. Another factor, mentioned in paragraph 59, was the predominance of African exports to European Union countries, which highlighted the need for the waiver on the EC-ACP arrangements. There was a trend towards increasing African exports to Asian developing countries. As an example of South-South cooperation, he hoped this would be strengthened and deepened.","WTCOMTDM28.pdf","Uganda, Africa, European, Union"

"2379",2379,"59","59.      The representative of the European Communities agreed with most of what had been said. She appreciated the questions and the pertinent analysis made by India. She also stressed the fact that least-developed countries, by definition, were the disadvantaged. However, she said that a positive trend could be detected for the last 25 years. What was interesting was the change in the composition of international trade. In 1974-75 oil was a major component of developing country exports, whereas presently an increase in manufactured exports could be detected.","WTCOMTDM28.pdf","European, Communities, India"
"2378",2378,"58","58.     The representative of Switzerland said that the representative of India had raised some very important questions, one of which he would try to answer. The study had taken 1948 as the base year, which was possibly not the best year to take as global trade at the time was quite diverted or disturbed. The study showed the increased importance of South-South trade, which had unfortunately been shown in the negative context of decreasing trade shares. One could also look at the facts in a positive way and highlight the growth potential of South-South trade.","WTCOMTDM28.pdf","Switzerland, India"
"2377",2377,"57","57.     The representative of Bangladesh said that the Secretariat report was very helpful. Speaking on behalf of LDCs and referring to paragraph 14 of the report on trade trends of least-developed countries, he said that they were very grateful that the Secretariat had made some very important comments based on reliable solid statistics. The report indicated that LDCs were by definition the weakest and the most vulnerable in their economic structures, further strengthening what LDCs had been saying all along. More importantly, the report said that LDCs' share of world trade had declined continuously between 1980-97 and that they had not enjoyed upswings as had some other developing countries. This fact strengthened the case for differentiated treatment for LDCs. In the same paragraph, his delegation had expected a comment on the current situation of LDCs, in terms of their performance vis-à-vis WTO obligations. He said that, speaking from the experience of Bangladesh and other LDCs, the LDCs as a group had performed well in respect of their WTO obligations, in the WT/COMTD/M/28 Page 14 context of derogations that were afforded to the LDCs as a group. The report would have had added weight had this fact been taken into account. He concluded by saying that though Bangladesh had been given extra marks for doing comparatively well, on the whole the results were worrying. It would be a shame for the international community to watch some countries get marginalized and dropped out of the scene although commitments had been made to help them on occasion.","WTCOMTDM28.pdf","Bangladesh, Secretariat, LDCs, Secretariat, LDCs, LDCs, WTO, Bangladesh, LDCs, WTO, Bangladesh"
"2376",2376,"56","56.      The representative of India said that the paper was factual and therefore not much could be said about it as facts could not be disputed. He hoped that more than a few delegations would participate in the discussion. According to the paper, in 1973 the share of international merchandise exports of developing countries was 20 per cent and had risen to 28 per cent in 1997, over a period of 24 years. However, developing countries had their largest share in 1948, with 33 per cent. It would be interesting to look at the reasons for the disappointing trend. It could be argued that the aim for developing countries was still to achieve the share of merchandise trade they had in 1948. One reason for the falling share was that knowledge industries and technology, which had contributed significantly to growth in certain countries, had largely bypassed developing countries. Secondly, the markets in the developed countries had not been very open in precisely those areas where developing countries had a competitive edge. Agriculture and textiles were obvious examples, but there could be others. The third reason, which was picked up both by the report and the representative of the United States, was that some countries had not managed their policy options well and had not liberalized or integrated enough. Moreover, developing countries, ranging from China to India to LDCs had had very different growth performances. The question needed to be posed as to why some among developing countries had done better than others. There were also some external factors, which were responsible for the poor statistics. There had been tremendous improvement in some developing countries but the global statistics were worrying. His delegation found the report extremely useful.","WTCOMTDM28.pdf","India, United, States, China, India, LDCs"
"2375",2375,"55","55.      The representative of the United States said that they had examined the paper and found it to be a very useful contribution. The paper clearly highlighted that the circumstances surrounding each Member were unique. A variety of factors affected the economic situation of Members, such as domestic policies, natural resources, the degree of trade liberalization, the ability to reform and diversify, and global economic conditions. Equally important was the paper's identification that, historically, those economies that had become the most integrated had increased market access both regionally and globally and had made the right decisions on trade policy and other policy choices. Another significant point in the paper was that building capacity, resolving developmental bottlenecks and increasing investors' confidence were highly important for developing countries, in particular for least-developed countries. These points could also be applied to a number of other countries in the world and were not exclusive. It would be important for future studies to take into account other changes in the international arena such as in job markets, manufacturing or other sectors, with a view to identifying factors that contributed to development and could possibly help developing countries leapfrog to a more equitable position vis-à-vis developed countries. Electronic commerce was one such area where significant amount of work had been done and where there was a strong interface between trade and development, access to information technology and training, but it needed to be better targeted. To the extent that developing countries had access to the necessary elements, they could leap into this particular area of trade without having to go through to traditional stages of development. They took note of the comments made by the representative of the Secretariat that trade in services had not been taken into account in the study, however, it would be critical for developing countries to see how developing countries, in addition to enhancing their existing manufacturing bases and others, could take advantage of new sectors.","WTCOMTDM28.pdf","United, States, Member, Members, Secretariat"
"2374",2374,"54","54.     The Director of the Development Division said that they had produced a new paper on the participation of developing countries in world trade, including recent developments in trade of LDCs. The last time that the subject-matter had been considered was in 1997, when the Secretariat had produced a document (WT/COMTD/W/31) just before the outset of the Asian and the broader financial crisis. That document had traced developments in developing countries' merchandise trade only in the 1990s, basically from 1991 to 1996. In the current period of recovery from the crisis, a broader and longer term approach had been adopted to study the matter, using three different perspectives: the very long-term perspective covering the entire fifty year period between 1948, the foundation of the GATT, and 1998, the last year for which full year figures were available; the perspective on the 1990s, from 1990 to 1998; and, lastly, a closer look at the effects of the financial crisis on developing countries' trade. A separate section treated developments in the trade of least-developed countries. He hoped that the paper brought out reasonably clearly the differing trends in developing countries' merchandise trade in these periods. It did not cover trade in services. It showed, for example, the uneven spread of trade development among regions and the relatively poor performance of commodity producers in general, compared to countries that had succeeded in transforming their economies towards the export of manufactures. The Secretariat had also examined the effects of the financial crisis on trade and the recovery process, which had begun, as far as they could trace it, in the first half of 1999. The recovery from the financial crisis was continuing and would need to be looked at again in one year's time to see its effects on developing countries' trade and future prospects.

She said there was no doubt these would also be fed into the processes going on in other WTO Bodies. However, this process of detailed debate on special and differential treatment was clearly not over, and the CTD would need to revert to it again in informal or formal meetings. In this context, she invited the Secretariat to formulate proposals on a follow up in practical and concrete terms, notably the proposal concerning a working mechanism on special and differential treatment. She suggested that further discussion on how to take up the subject be held under Agenda Item E on the work programme for this year.","WTCOMTDM28.pdf","Chairperson, WTO, CTD, Secretariat"
"2370",2370,"50","50.     The representative of the Philippines said that the delegation of Canada appeared to assert the view that one could not a priori say that there could not be a different set of rules for developed and developing countries, and that therefore the rules always needed to be the same. The delegation of WT/COMTD/M/28 Page 12 Canada had also stated that the WTO was not a development organisation but a rules-based organisation. The representative of the Philippines said that his delegation had serious concerns regarding these statements, as they appeared to reflect a serious misunderstanding as to what the WTO was all about. The Explanatory Note to the Marrakesh Agreement did not consist of empty words: the Appellate Body had said that those notes gave ""colour, texture, and shading"" to the rules formulated. The Marrakesh Agreement stated that one of the objectives of the WTO Agreements was to ensure that developing countries, particularly the least-developed, had an equitable share in the growth of world trade. One could not, therefore, argue a priori as to whether rules should be equal or not equal. The issue was to ensure that the rules, however formulated, should be implemented; the objective of securing an equitable share in the growth of world trade for all Members: if this meant that differentiated treatment was required, then this should be put into place to ensure that the objective was attained. The Philippines was of the view therefore, that special and differential treatment was simply part of compliance with the Explanatory Note to the Marrakesh Agreement.","WTCOMTDM28.pdf","Philippines, Canada, Canada, WTO, Philippines, WTO, WTO, Members, Philippines"

The subject needed to be included on the agenda of the CTD in subsequent sessions. He said that Members should not be caught up in lengthy debates regarding whether special and differential treatment should be legally enforceable or not, but rather that the focus needed to be on solving the problems that had been identified in relation to special and differential treatment.","WTCOMTDM28.pdf","Ghana, CTD, Members"
"2367",2367,"48","48.       The representative of Canada said it would be a mistake to be overly concerned as to whether or not, technical assistance was part of special and differential treatment as this was largely an artificial question. It was, rather, more important to focus on the purpose of provisions for special and differential treatment. The focus of these provisions – especially those relating to transition periods – was to provide the time necessary to develop the required capacity to undertake commitments under different agreements, and it was in this context that capacity building came into play. Recalling the comments made at the Seminar made by the representative of the World Bank, the representative of Canada said that one could not consider special and differential treatment in isolation. Coherence amongst the policy and programmes of the various multilateral actors on the international scene was a matter of importance, and that it was particularly important to ensure that the WTO, the World Bank, the regional banks and donors work together more concretely to ensure complementarity in their policies and programmes, and to avoid contradiction and duplication. Recalling the comments made by the representative of India regarding the non-discriminatory nature of special and differential treatment, he said that he was doubtful whether the fact that there were developing country Members at various stages of development could ever be fully reflected in an organisation such as the WTO, which was a rules-based organisation. Such questions could be usefully addressed in other fora, such as the World Bank, and in terms of activities undertaken by donors. This meant that the trade agenda and the trade dimension needed to be brought to the development efforts made elsewhere, as the WTO was not a development organisation, nor did it need to be one. Members would do the WTO a disservice by focusing on whether technical assistance was part of special and differential treatment. Members negotiated whatever special and differential treatment was deemed necessary, and the focus for ensuring that special and differential provisions were effective lay in organisations other than the WTO.","WTCOMTDM28.pdf","Canada, World, Bank, Canada, WTO, World, Bank, India, Members, WTO, World, Bank, WTO, Members, WTO, Members, WTO"

The representative of Norway said that his delegation disagreed with the view that technical assistance was not a part of special and differential treatment, and referred to the relevant provisions of the TBT Agreement which the representative of India himself had cited. He said that the fact that technical assistance was part of special and differential treatment did not undermine the legitimacy of the proposal to increase the regular budget for technical assistance, and that this should be a collective responsibility. His delegation was of the view that provisions for special and differential treatment were an integral part of the provisions for all WTO Agreements, that technical assistance was part of that package, and that Members had a collective responsibility to finance technical assistance through the regular budget, though this was not to the exclusion of voluntary contributions.","WTCOMTDM28.pdf","Norway, India, WTO, Members"
"2365",2365,"46","46.     The representative of Uganda said the Seminar had provided a welcome in-depth discussion of special and differential treatment, though the provision of added time for interaction with speakers would have been desirable. His delegation had noted the intervention made by the EC concerning the extension of duty-free market access to ""essentially all"" products, and hoped that in subsequent consultations it would be possible to clarify whether this formulation would actually provide new                                                                                      WT/COMTD/M/28                                                                                             Page 11 market access. His delegation also noted the presentation at the Seminar made by the representative of the IMF who had stated that the formulation ""essentially all"" may not amount to much. He said that technical assistance and capacity-building were of great importance to least-developed countries, adding that it was the understanding of his delegation that funding for technical assistance through the core budget would be additional to, and not a substitute for, voluntary contributions by donors. His delegation hoped that one would not begrudge the least-developed countries the targeting to their specific needs of the majority of voluntary contributions. His delegation was also of the view that capacity-building was not a substitute for enhanced market access.","WTCOMTDM28.pdf","Uganda, EC, IMF"
"2364",2364,"45","45.     The representative of Thailand said that the subject of special and differential treatment should remain on the agenda of the CTD at its next meeting. His delegation was of the view that if all Members paid for technical assistance, technical assistance should be treated separately from special and differential treatment.","WTCOMTDM28.pdf","Thailand, CTD, Members"
"2363",2363,"44","44.     The representative of Guinea said that speakers at the Seminar on Special and Differential Treatment had all pointed out that the provisions for special and differential treatment in the WTO agreements had failed to generate any tangible benefits for developing countries, and speakers had also noted that there was a great degree of variation in levels of development amongst developing countries. Her delegation was of the view that the Seminar had been useful, and that further work should be done on the subject of special and differential treatment.","WTCOMTDM28.pdf","Guinea, WTO"
"2362",2362,"43","43.      The representative of India, referring to comments made about the need to differentiate between developing countries and the value of a case-by-case approach, said that when one considered Part IV of the GATT and the origins of special and differential treatment, two things became very clear. First, special and differential treatment was based on non-reciprocity, that is, developing countries were not required to pay for it; and, second, it was non-discriminatory, which was to say that there was to be no differentiation between developing countries, aside from the references to least-developed countries. These points needed to be borne in mind when speaking about the concept of special and differential treatment as it stood. If there was a desire to renegotiate special and differential treatment, that was a different matter. He also said that the question of whether technical assistance was part of special and differential treatment or not was perhaps somewhat academic. If one considered, for instance, Article 12 of the TBT Agreement, then clearly technical assistance did fall under special and differential treatment. However, if this was the case, then it was somewhat intriguing that there were calls to fund technical assistance from the core budget, while it was simultaneously being argued that technical assistance was part of special and differential treatment. Funding technical assistance from the core budget meant that all Members would pay for technical assistance, albeit in different amounts, and this was not consonant with the idea of special and differential treatment.","WTCOMTDM28.pdf","India, GATT, Members"
"2361",2361,"42","42.      The representative of Argentina said that that both the proceedings of the Seminar and the contents of document WT/COMTD/W/66 should form the basis of major work carried out by the CTD regarding the subject of special and differential treatment. His delegation joined others in asking for more time to be allocated for Members to interact with the ideas expressed by panelists. His delegation was particularly struck by statements made in the seminar which showed that the areas in which developing countries benefited from comparative advantage, particularly textiles and agriculture, were precisely those which had met difficulties in becoming integrated into the multilateral trading system over its 50 year history. His delegation supported the statements made by the delegations of Uruguay and Chile regarding the importance of market access; and when discussing market access, one needed to bear in mind not only access to markets in developed countries, but also the question of competing with subsidised exports in traditional markets. He said that such questions needed to be addressed when attempting to ensure that all members participated in the international trading system under the equal conditions by which all countries were ensured access for their products with the same rules and disciplines.","WTCOMTDM28.pdf","Argentina, CTD, Members, Uruguay, Chile"
"2360",2360,"41","41.      The representative of Guatemala said that his delegation supported the view that, in future events, there be a greater degree of interaction between panelists and participants, especially given that there remained to be held two very important seminars in the context of the CTD's work programme for the year 2000. The Seminar had raised a number of important and relevant points for the future work of the CTD on special and differential treatment. He said that technical assistance was a priority and an important instrument for development for a country like Guatemala, but was not the only issue of importance. Technical assistance was a parallel mechanism to the work that needed to be done in generating development. He said that there existed differences in development between all countries: Guatemala was a small, developing country which faced constraints on its full integration into the multilateral trading system and full participation in its benefits. Finally, his WT/COMTD/M/28 Page 10 delegation supported others who said that the subject of special and differential treatment should be kept on the agenda of the CTD.","WTCOMTDM28.pdf","Guatemala, CTD, CTD, Guatemala, Guatemala, CTD"

He said that future events of this nature needed to allow for greater interactivity between Members. His delegation held the view that future discussion on the topic should not be diluted into political declarations. Nevertheless, it was important to recognise that the question of special and differential treatment did have many political connotations, as had been pointed out by other delegations which had stressed the need for political will to make such provisions enforceable, and that one could not divorce technical analysis from political factors.","WTCOMTDM28.pdf","Ecuador, Members"

"2357",2357,"39","39.      The representative of Chile said his delegation believed that the Seminar had been a useful exercise, and was of the view that the importance of the topics treated did not coincide with time allocated. He said that the subject of special and differential treatment needed further work, and sufficient time needed to be allocated to the treatment of each specific topic that had been taken up in the Seminar. Referring to a statement made by one delegation in the course of the Seminar, he said that special and differential provisions for market access was an important factor in strengthening the integration of all members into the multilateral trading system.","WTCOMTDM28.pdf","Chile"
"2356",2356,"38","38.     The representative of Mauritius said his delegation shared the Chairperson's views about the problem of time constraints which hindered the interaction between delegates and participants in the Seminar, and requested that the Secretariat take this into account when organising seminars in the future. He said the ideas and views put forward in the Seminar had furthered the understanding of the concept of special and differential treatment. It should be possible to build on the views expressed to explore the applicability, enforceability and utility of special and differential provisions, keeping in mind the specificity of small and vulnerable Member countries. His delegation was of the view that the contributions of Members in the pre-Seattle process, as well as any other new contribution that may be made, should be taken into account in the context of further work. He said his delegation had argued that any multilateral agreement could not be static, but rather that provisions should be dynamic and responsive to changes. His delegation agreed that the issue of special and differential treatment needed to be de-politicised, though it did appear that, with regard to the question of enforceability, political will was needed to bring about a conclusion that was satisfactory to all.","WTCOMTDM28.pdf","Mauritius, Chairperson, Secretariat, Member, Members"
"2355",2355,"37","37.      The representative of Saint Lucia said her delegation was of the view that the need to review provisions for special and differential treatment was significant. She shared the views expressed by previous speakers, and in particular concurred with the views expressed by Switzerland on the need to de-politicise the treatment of special and differential treatment and to address issues in a systematic way. There seemed little evidence to suggest that the Uruguay Round Agreements had approached the various provisions for special and differential treatment in a systematic way, whether these were                                                                                     WT/COMTD/M/28                                                                                             Page 9 transition periods, flexibility provisions, best endeavour clauses, thresholds, and so forth, and there was insufficient evidence of logical and well reasoned approach to the rules. She said that for Saint Lucia the issue of differentiated treatment was not political but real. Saint Lucia's small size and vulnerability, dependency on commodity exports, lack of capacity and need for retraining to promote economic diversification, required flexible provisions for special and differential treatment sufficiently sensitive to the needs of countries like Saint Lucia. Referring to Aristotle's definition of justice, she said that the concepts of MFN and national treatment meant that equals were treated equally, and unequals unequally. The WTO should not shirk from the challenge of developing a multilateral trading system that offered something for all its Members. She said therefore that the Seminar should contribute to further work and research on the subject of special and differential treatment, with a view to achieving positive results.","WTCOMTDM28.pdf","Lucia, Switzerland, Uruguay, Saint, Lucia, Saint, Lucia, Saint, Lucia, Aristotle, MFN, WTO, Members"

The representative of Japan, responding to the question raised by the representative of Bolivia, said that provisions for special and differential treatment could be classified into different categories, as stated in document WT/COMTD/W/66. She clarified that her reference to a ""case-by-case"" approach meant that any improvements to the provisions for special and differential treatment could be handled in the context of these categories. She also said that within any given agreement, there were many different categories of special and differential treatment.","WTCOMTDM28.pdf","Japan, Bolivia"
"2353",2353,"35","35.      The representative of Kenya said that one shortcoming of the Seminar was the little time allowed for interaction between the panelists and the floor. He said that the representative of Senegal had pointed out how this problem could be overcome. He said that an examination of the list of speakers showed a disproportionate number of Geneva-based speakers, especially when compared to the number of academics and representatives of international organisations who actually had empirical evidence to back their view points. The whole point of a seminar was to allow the expression of independent view-points which would allow Members to make decisions, and not to have a re-run by ambassadors of country proposals with which everyone was familiar. He said this critique needed to be taken into account in the organisation of future seminars. Regarding the issues of special and differential treatment and technical assistance, he recalled that prior to Seattle, lengthy discussions had been held on technical cooperation, and notably the financing of technical assistance through the regular budget. He said that if technical assistance was to be considered a part of special and differential treatment, then, by extrapolation, its cost should be met by those who should provide it.","WTCOMTDM28.pdf","Kenya, Senegal, Members, Seattle"
"2352",2352,"34","34.      She said that the Secretariat document WT/COMTD/W/66 was useful as it contained responses to the questionnaire and a compilation of different implementation difficulties connected with WTO Agreements. Her delegation found that the Seminar was of great use, and it served to highlight the value of the totality of provisions for special and differential treatment. There were many lessons to be pondered, stemming from contributions from the floor and from panelists, and her delegation joined others in suggesting that the subject be kept on the agenda. She noted that in listening to this debate, all were agreed that a key objective of special and differential treatment was the full integration of Members into the multilateral trading system. It nevertheless appeared to her delegation that, unfortunately, such a goal was receding, and that the present situation was best characterised as a two-tier system of participation. It was therefore the view of her delegation that provisions for special and differential treatment needed to be dynamic and more responsive to the general and specific needs of developing countries.","WTCOMTDM28.pdf","Secretariat, WTO, Members"
"2351",2351,"33","33.      The representative of Panama said that the Seminar had reflected the various views held by Members, both developed and developing. Her delegation was of the view that, as proposed by several other delegations, work on the subject should continue, drawing on material that was already available. She said that the questionnaire was still not complete, and the question needed to be asked as to whether there were difficulties and complications with the questionnaire, and that the Secretariat should investigate this matter. She said that the conclusions of the Seminar showed clearly that special and differential treatment was a factor in integration of developing countries into the multilateral trading system, and better mechanisms were needed to ensure that special and differential treatment yielded optimal results. Her delegation suggested that the Secretariat should present a strategy for better mechanisms for special and differential treatment on an agreement-by-agreement basis, in order to enhance the integration of developing countries into the multilateral trading system.","WTCOMTDM28.pdf","Panama, Members, Secretariat, Secretariat"
"2350",2350,"32","32.      The representative of the United States said her delegation shared the views expressed by the Chairperson and by other delegations concerning the Seminar on Special and Differential Treatment, particularly in regard to the fact that the Seminar had been the occasion for setting out a variety of views. Her delegation had however expected there to have been more time for interaction from the floor, and had come prepared to interact, but had not done so as it did not wish to interrupt the flow of the discussion. Her delegation was of the view that all Members would benefit from a further constructive examination of special and differential treatment, in particular of the specific provisions for special and differential treatment in individual agreements, and in the context of country-specific requirements. Her delegation agreed with the comments made by the EC regarding the nature of special and differential treatment, which had been corroborated by some of the presentations made in the Seminar. Her delegation agreed that capacity-building and technical assistance went, in some cases, hand-in-hand with provisions for special and differential treatment. She said that when special and differential treatment was examined in specific agreements, it was found that special and differential treatment was expressed in various forms, such as: transition times; particular circumstances when safeguard action might be taken; or in terms of technical cooperation and capacity building. The view of her delegation was that capacity building itself amounted to more than just technical assistance. She said that some ideas floated before and during Seattle had heightened the understanding of capacity building. Capacity building was not equivalent to technical assistance, and the concept of capacity-building that should be developed within the CTD included an identification, within the context of WTO Agreements, of how capacity could be addressed in the light of commitments undertaken by the country in question as well as in the light of requirements to strengthen the country's integration into the multilateral trading system. She recalled a paper submitted by the EC, during the preparatory process for Seattle, which called for capacity building issues to be addressed up-front. Given that negotiations on agriculture and services were underway, her delegation was committed to examine how capacity building could factor in an initial matter. She said that any provisions for special and differential treatment needed to be viewed as mechanisms that would help give effect to commitments that had been undertaken.

The representative of Pakistan said that the Seminar had been useful and hoped that it would be possible to build on these views in terms of the applicability, enforceability and utility of special and differential provisions in the WTO's future work programme. His delegation was of the view that the document WT/COMTD/W/66 was very useful both in terms of its compilation of responses from delegations and its identification of difficulties. When read in conjunction with proposals made both in the preparatory process for Seattle and in the context of the General Council's work on implementation, it provided the basis for the resolution of a number of difficulties relating to special and differential treatment and the broader issue of implementation. His delegation was of the view that technical assistance on one hand, and special and differential treatment on the other were two separate entities which should not be muddled one with the other, though they could be mutually reinforcing. His delegation requested that the subject of special and differential treatment be kept on the agenda of the next meeting, as further work on the subject was required.","WTCOMTDM28.pdf","Pakistan, WTO, Seattle, General, Council"

The representative of the Philippines said his delegation had noted that a number of suggestions had been made as to how to build on proposals made in the preparatory process for Seattle and the deliberations of the Seminar. His delegation attempted to be somewhat more ambitious, in proposing the establishment of a working mechanism on special and differential treatment, as had been mentioned by the Swiss delegation. The purpose of this mechanism would be                                                                                     WT/COMTD/M/28                                                                                             Page 7 to process information, establish markers, and identify priorities. Issues dealt within this mechanism would be the applicability and enforceability of special and differential treatment; the differentiation between technical assistance and special and differential treatment; and the issue of specificity in both technical assistance and special and differential treatment. He said that the specificity of provisions relating to least-developed countries had been recognised in the Seminar, but that it was important to ensure the universality, applicability and enforceability of all special and differential treatment provisions relating to all other developing countries. Another issue that needed to be tackled was the reassessment of the WTO's technical assistance strategy, in terms of the delivery of technical assistance and its financial viability. The range and scope of demands for technical assistance which arose in the WTO pointed to the importance of good planning.","WTCOMTDM28.pdf","Philippines, Seattle, WTO, WTO"

The representative of Jamaica said his delegation valued the fact that the Seminar was the occasion for exposure to different ways of thinking, even though his delegation was not in agreement with all the views expressed.

"2345",2345,"28","28.      The representative of Cuba said the proceedings of the Seminar on Special and Differential Treatment were a valuable input into the work of the organisation. His delegation was of the view that technical assistance alone was insufficient to address the structural problems faced by developing countries, and that special and differential treatment was a fundamental pillar in international economic relations, given the gap between developed and developing countries. As pointed out by the representative of Canada, special and differential treatment and enhanced market access were able to strengthen the integration of developing countries into the world economy. Hence, special and differential treatment in the WTO Agreements should be given a binding character and, for certain provisions, clearer language and a clearer statement of objectives was required. As stated by the delegation of India, the recommendations made in the Seminar needed to be kept under review and be incorporated in the executive part of the work of the WTO.","WTCOMTDM28.pdf","Cuba, Canada, WTO, India, WTO"

The representative of Canada appreciated the approach taken by the Secretariat in document WT/COMTD/W/66 in compiling difficulties relating to the implementation of provisions for special and differential treatment, and encouraged the Secretariat to proceed further with this work by using submissions made by delegations as an input to the document, and further to use as an input the steps taken by Members to comply with provisions for special and differential treatment. Her delegation was of the view that special and differential treatment could be made more development-enhancing, and was interested in questions such as, ""Could special and differential treatment be an instrument for bringing trade to development, by opening markets, enhancing capacity and adapting rules to local circumstances?"" Her delegation was of the view that the Seminar on Special and Differential Treatment had provided much matter for further reflection, and shared the views expressed by the Chairperson that time-management was an issue that needed to be addressed.","WTCOMTDM28.pdf","Canada, Secretariat, Secretariat, Members, Chairperson"
"2343",2343,"26","26.      The representative of Senegal said that his delegation shared the views expressed by the Chairperson, in her report on the Seminar, regarding the problem of time-management. One solution was to reduce the number of speakers and topics discussed. His delegation was of the view that closer attention needed to be given to the selection of panelists, adding that the decision to simultaneously select Messrs. Benjelloun-Touimi, Narayanan, Abbot and Akram was – with all due respect to them - perhaps not the best option. On the other hand, his delegation noted with satisfaction the presence of, WT/COMTD/M/28 Page 6 and the presentations made by, UNCTAD and the South Centre. Regarding the use of external speakers and panelists, his delegation was of the view that there could be merit in drawing up a list of resource-persons which could be updated every year. His delegation was of the view that if the objective of the Seminar was to provide an occasion for the expression of a number of diverse opinions, then the Seminar had been a success. The views expressed had also enabled his delegation to gain a better understanding of the subject of special and differential treatment, though it regretted that it had not been possible to hear the views of those delegations which had submitted proposals in the preparatory process for Seattle. His delegation was of the view that though special and differential treatment provisions were on the whole vague, imprecise, and non-binding, they were of value to developing countries. Now that the concept of special and differential treatment had been confronted with the reality of implementation, the task remained to make sure the concept was made more precise and less vague. Much remained to be done for the views of different Members on special and differential treatment to converge, and his delegation did not share the point of view held by certain Members that all Members had equal obligations, and that any difference in means should be corrected by means of technical assistance. His delegation was of the view that special and differential treatment went hand in hand with differentiated responsibility.","WTCOMTDM28.pdf","Senegal, Chairperson, Benjelloun-Touimi, Narayanan, Abbot, Akram, UNCTAD, South, Centre, Seattle, Members, Members, Members"
"2342",2342,"25","25.      The representative of Bangladesh said his delegation had benefited from the different papers that had been submitted in the Seminar, and notably the paper prepared by Mr. Kessie. The idea conveyed in this paper, namely that provisions for special and differential treatment had little legal enforceability, added an extra dimension to the debate. He said that, from the point of view of least- developed countries, the various elements of special and differential treatment, while in some instances, needing further refinement, discussion and negotiation, constituted a package that stood by itself, and which was a part of international development cooperation. He said that the least- developed countries gave very high priority to market access and technical assistance for capacity building. While issues pertaining to transition times, flexibility of commitments and non-reciprocity were discussed, the least-developed countries stood to gain most from rapid action by the international community in the fields of market access and technical assistance. On the issue of market access, the granting of unrestricted, bound, duty- and quota-free access for all products originating in least- developed countries would generate significant benefits to these countries, without causing significant losses to the trade of other countries. His delegation welcomed the statement made at the Seminar on Special and Differential treatment by the EC to the effect that they would provide duty-free access for 99 per cent of all products, and urged other members to join in the effort of improving market access conditions for least-developed countries. Finally, regarding technical assistance for capacity-building, Bangladesh was of the view that the IF was a central focus. The IF represented a commitment that had been made at the Singapore Ministerial and renewed at the Geneva Ministerial, and was intended to address critical issues of trade-related capacity. In the context of the IF, a number of least- developed countries had undertaken various activities, such as the preparation of needs assessment documentation, and in some cases the holding of Round Tables and the preparation of multi-year programmes of technical assistance. It was now up to the international community to translate the commitment undertaken in Singapore into concrete action.","WTCOMTDM28.pdf","Bangladesh, Kessie, EC, Bangladesh, Singapore, Geneva, Ministerial, Singapore"

The representative of Egypt said that the Secretariat document WT/COMTD/W/66 showed that the paper made available by Egypt in response to the questionnaire had been used (WT/COMTD/W/49), and his delegation was of the view that inputs made by several other delegations in the context of the CTD could also be used. His delegation encouraged other countries to provide written responses to the questionnaire. He said that the Seminar on Special and Differential Treatment had been the occasion for an interesting exchange of views, and that his delegation shared the views expressed by the chairperson regarding the problem of time constraints. He said that the sessions were too tight to allow for sufficient interaction between the floor and panelists. Future seminars needed to take into account these concerns. His delegation was of the view that further reflection should be held on the views expressed and that the topic of special and differential treatment should feature on the agenda of the next meeting. His delegation emphasised that the major concern regarding special and differential treatment provisions was that they had remained ""best endeavours"", which had led to an inability to determine the full scope of benefits that developing countries could reap from provisions for special and differential treatment. His delegation believed that one of the dimensions that needed to be addressed in the future was how to make special and differential treatment provisions legally binding, and he recalled that the point had been made in the Seminar that under these binding provisions, the advantages derived by developing countries needed to be negotiated so that the exact benefits from the provisions could be identified. He said that Egypt did not share the view that technical cooperation activities were part of special and differential treatment, as they addressed questions of capacity building and human-resource constraints in developing countries.","WTCOMTDM28.pdf","Egypt, Secretariat, Egypt, CTD, Egypt"
"2340",2340,"23","23.      The representative of India said that the Secretariat document WT/COMTD/W/66 was a useful input into discussions relating to special and differential treatment. He noted the concerns that had been stated about the lack of response to the questionnaires, and recalled that, at the time the questionnaire was circulated, many developing countries had been involved in the process of putting forward their views on a whole range of implementation issues in the General Council preparatory process for Seattle. He said it would be useful to take account of the ideas that had been put forward in the preparatory process in the CTD's discussion on special and differential treatment. He said that the Seminar on Special and Differential Treatment had been of great benefit, primarily because discussions had not been solely theoretical but had also had a practical focus. Referring to the comments made the EC on technical assistance and differentiation, he said that while nobody in the Seminar had questioned the role of technical assistance in building capacity, many had stated that technical assistance activities had to be carried out in parallel, and not as a substitute, to other responses to problems that developing countries had been facing in the implementation of WTO Agreements. Regarding the issue of differentiation and adopting a case-by-case approach, he said that while this was possibly valid in the context of bilateral technical assistance, it could not be incorporated into the whole gamut of special and differential treatment, as provisions for special and differential treatment had been accepted as universal, and it had been clearly stated that they needed to remain so. He said that the Seminar had helped to focus on the three most important points pertaining to special and differential treatment provisions, namely their applicability, their enforceability and their utility. Finally, he said that it was necessary to keep the issue of special and differential treatment on the agenda for the next meeting of the CTD, in order to build upon the work carried out in the Seminar, and to provide inputs into the broader work on implementation that was ongoing in the WTO.

"2339",2339,"22","22.     The representative of the European Communities said that the WT/COMTD/W/66 document was a useful stock-taking exercise. She said the Seminar on Special and Differential Treatment was of great value, adding that special and differential treatment was a very important component of the multilateral trading system, and that it was timely to ask questions about its future role in the WT/COMTD/M/28 Page 4 multilateral trading system. Her delegation welcomed the presence of academics and other specialists as this had lifted the debate from short-term concerns to long-term systemic issues. She highlighted two inter-linked questions, namely, the value of preferential access as a form of special and differential treatment, and, second, the role of technical assistance, and pointed to the complementarity of these two forms of special and differential treatment. Technical assistance was an integral part of special and differential treatment, and this was reflected in the fact that a number of specific agreements referred to the delivery of technical assistance. She said that there was little value in establishing priorities between different types of special and differential treatment, and that it seemed clear from the debate that different developing countries would take advantage of different types of special and differential treatment, depending on their level of development, the composition of their exports, and so on. The conclusion was that while all forms of special and differential treatment were important, they could not be expected to have the same impact or work in the same way for every single country. She said that another concept which had arisen from the discussions held in the Seminar was the degree of differentiation between developing countries. While the creation of new categories would create more problems than it would solve, it was necessary to take into account the fact that differences existed and, therefore, without formalising different categories, to consider each country on its own merits, as was done with needs assessments in the Integrated Framework (IF) and in the case of technical assistance for implementation. She recalled the approach the EC had put forward for capacity-building, namely that capacity-building should be made operational through, for example, a menu approach when new obligations were involved, and through a step-by-step approach. Finally, if it were true that all forms of special and differential treatment were available and differentiation was an element to take into account, the question arose as to whether this needed to be taken as a ""still-life feature"". As had been pointed out in the seminar by the representative of the EC, the objective of special and differential treatment was to further the integration of Members into the trading system, and, hence, if special and differential treatment was to be beneficial, it needed to be set within a time-limited period, so that one did not end up with a two-tier system of rules.","WTCOMTDM28.pdf","European, Communities, EC, EC, Members"
"2338",2338,"21","21.      The representative of Switzerland said a number of political statements had been made in the Seminar, pointing to the sensitivity of special and differential treatment and the importance of such provisions in the functioning of the WTO. He said that the priority was now to de-politicise and rationally analyse the topic, as was done in the Secretariat document, and to analyse and focus on those provisions for special and differential treatment which held out the promise of strengthening the integration of targeted WTO Members into the multilateral trading system. He said that many would probably agree that it was not the goal of special and differential treatment to set aside WTO rules for most of its Members. It was necessary to recognise that there were problems which lay beyond the reach of special and differential treatment and which needed to be addressed by means other than the use of special and differential treatment. What was needed now was an efficient structure that could deal with special and differential treatment without being side-tracked by political statements and political counter-statements.","WTCOMTDM28.pdf","Switzerland, WTO, Secretariat, WTO, Members, WTO, Members"

With regard to the Secretariat document, WT/COMTD/W/66, on the difficulties Members might have experienced in the implementation of special and differential treatment, his delegation reiterated that the usefulness of the document suffered from the fact that only a small number of Members had replied to the questionnaire. He referred to paragraph 3 of the document, recalling that a number of proposals relating to special and differential treatment had been submitted in the Seattle preparatory process. He said a comprehensive discussion of these proposals, along with other views, comments and concerns expressed by developing countries would be useful.","WTCOMTDM28.pdf","Norway, Secretariat, Members, Members, Seattle"

The representative of Japan said that the various views expressed by Members, especially from developing countries, in the Seminar on Special and Differential Treatment, should contribute to and be taken into account in future discussions on the topic in the WTO. Regarding the improvement of special and differential treatment, she said that the document WT/COMTD/W/66 provided a classification of provisions for special and differential treatment into five different categories, and that Japan was of the view that a review of these provisions, possibly for their improvement, needed to be undertaken on a case-by-case basis. She recalled that the CTD had drawn up a questionnaire on the implementation of the provisions for special and differential treatment in 1998, and said that the information contained in responses to this was an essential basis for the discussion of the improvement of provisions for special and differential treatment in the future.

The Director of the Development Division said that the document had been prepared in response to a request made by the CTD for information on special and differential treatment and difficulties experienced by Members in implementing these provisions. The aim of the document was to identify concrete concerns that had been raised by developing countries regarding the implementation of WTO Agreements. The document was based on two elements; first, a questionnaire completed by Members, and secondly, on the basis of information available in the Secretariat. The document was divided into two parts. First, there was a compilation of responses, of which there were very few, made by Members. Direct replies had been given by six Members, while two others referred to communications they had made either to the CTD or to the General Council,                                                                                        WT/COMTD/M/28                                                                                                Page 3 and the main conclusions of these communications were reflected in the Note. Second, there was a compilation of statements and communications made by Members in different WTO Bodies on special and differential treatment, with a particular focus on implementation. The second part of the document attempted to summarise, agreement-by-agreement, the concerns that had been raised in various WTO Bodies regarding the implementation of provisions for special and differential treatment.","WTCOMTDM28.pdf","Director, Development, Division, CTD, Members, WTO, Members, Secretariat, Members, Members, CTD, General, Council, Members, WTO, WTO"

As Chairman of an OECD Committee, I fully share in the consensus emerging from the OECD Ministerial meeting last May that in a new trade Round, development considerations must be a central element.         As Chairman of the Development Assistance Committee (DAC), I want to convey just how much importance the donor community attaches to interacting with the trade community, to better understanding the opportunities and constraints faced by developing countries as they strive to become more prominent players in the world trading system, and to working actively to help them do so through the instruments of development co-operation.         I welcome this opportunity therefore to be able to inform you of the ways in which we work in the DAC and how donors might be able to respond constructively to some of the trade challenges faced by our developing partners.         Allow me to say a few words about the role of the DAC in the OECD, how we operate and how, through the co-ordinated activities of our Member states, we might make a contribution to enhancing the capacity of developing countries to share in the dynamic synergies between trade and growth in the global economy.          As an intergovernmental organisation that promotes policy dialogue on a wide range of policy issues of relevance to its 29 Member states, the OECD has no executive powers or funds to disburse. It does not provide technical assistance in any classical sense, except in a few exceptional cases. But by providing analysis in and across different policy areas as a basis for dialogue, encouraging peer review and good practices, working to produce policy guidelines and harmonising views as a basis for effective approaches to international issues, Member states benefit a great deal from sharing experiences with others. And increasingly, this process of sharing experience, good practices and guidelines is extending beyond the membership of the OECD, as our Organisation reaches out to other regions and actors.         This work of the OECD is essentially accomplished through our Committee structures. The DAC is one such Committee, where representatives from bilateral agencies, with the UNDP, the World Bank and the IMF as permanent observers, try to develop common approaches, enhance effectiveness of aid delivery, improve co-ordination among donors, identify good practices and develop guidelines.         In 1996, the DAC produced a short, high level report ""Shaping the 21st Century: the Role of Development Co-operation"", which laid out a strategy based on internationally agreed development goals and partnership principles. This has since become known as the Development Partnerships Strategy. I must say that this approach has proved to be a powerful influence in the international system. Just a few weeks ago, at the time of the annual IMF/WB meetings in Washington, it was agreed that World Bank and IMF programmes for poor countries will in future be based on poverty WT/COMTD/M/27 Page 10 reduction strategies and partnership principles. The Managing Director of the IMF, M. Camdessus, set out in the form of 7 Pledges , the key UN Conference goals that had been identified in the DAC Report.         The centrepiece of these goals is the reduction of the incidence of poverty by one half by the year 2015. It is clear that such a goal can only be achieved if developing countries can generate a dynamic and sustainable growth process. That requires the possibility and the capacity to engage in, a dynamic fashion, in global trade and investment flows. In this context, a new WTO Round will be a major opportunity for the trade policy community to contribute to an historic reduction of poverty in the world at the beginning of the 21st Century. OECD Support for Integrating the Developing Countries in the Global Trading System         In the past two years, the OECD Council at Ministerial level has given prominence to better elaborating the links between trade, investment and development, to promoting more coherent policy making towards developing countries, and to enhancing the role of the OECD in helping to integrate developing countries in the global trading system. At the meeting this year, Ministers emphasised that the new Round must be responsive to the needs of all developing countries and that in this respect, particular emphasis must be given to the special needs of least developed countries, including improved market access.         These views were echoed also at the DAC’s High Level Meeting of Development Ministers in May of this year. The DAC HLM stressed the importance of reflecting development perspectives in preparations for the new Trade Round. Ministers also indicated that development co-operation could help identify effective instruments and approaches to build capacity for trade, for implementing Uruguay Round Agreements and for effective developing country participation in the new round. These messages have also been emphasised at the Cologne G8 Summit and at the annual World Bank/IMF meetings just three weeks ago.        In short, we consider the relationship between trade and development to be an essential one and a major priority for everyone.          Developing countries clearly have a major responsibility themselves for putting in place trade-friendly policies that promote their further integration in the global economy.         But the OECD countries also recognise that policy coherence matters and the need therefore in OECD capitals, to become more aware of the development impacts of policy incoherence and to better co-ordinate policy-making in instances where trade or other policies risk undermining development prospects.         So what does this mean for the OECD and for the DAC in particular?         We will try to move forward on two fronts.         First, we will confront the challenge of policy coherence by moving to set in train processes, both in OECD countries and at the OECD in Paris, to ensure that the development impact of policy making is analysed, discussed and acted on.        Second, we must try to become better aware of the particular needs and constraints in developing countries for enhancing their capacity to become dynamic participants in trade, and then to respond with effective development co-operation activities.         I will now briefly address these two areas of activity.                                                                                     WT/COMTD/M/27                                                                                            Page 11 Addressing the Challenges of Policy Coherence          The arrangements now in place for addressing policy coherence issues among the WTO, the IMF and the World Bank are an indication that policy coherence is an area that requires systematic attention.        In the OECD, we have responded to a mandate from Ministers to prepare a report on the links between trade, investment and development and how OECD countries can better promote policy coherence. This report, entitled ""Policy Coherence Matters"", has been provided for this meeting.        OECD Ministers thus do indeed recognise the central importance of policy coherence towards developing countries, in national policy-making frameworks as well as in international policy frameworks. But as we all know, coherent policy-making is far from easy in practice. There are numerous political constraints at every level.       Keeping it on the agenda at the OECD is important. And Members of the DAC and the Trade Committee are deepening their interaction as preparations step up for Seattle and beyond.         In the DAC itself, we are now systematically including an assessment of policy coherence in our ""peer review"" process. This is a process of examining each DAC Member’s development co-operation policies and is perhaps comparable to your Trade Policy Review Mechanism. By considering a few issues of policy coherence for each of the DAC Members in the context of the Peer Review, we are able to stimulate awareness and policy discussion processes in capitals.        Further, we are setting out to prepare a ""policy coherence checklist"". This checklist will provide guidance for policy makers in OECD capitals with respect to the impacts of policies on economic and social development in partner countries. It will also consider the institutional aspects of policy coherence to see how different agencies, national and international are able to take development impacts into account. It will address a variety of policy areas including:         -       trade, agriculture and food security, and issues such as research, intellectual property                 rights and information technology;         -       international finance, debt, investment, private sector relations and migration;         -       environment issues;         -       peacekeeping and conflict resolution, and the arms trade.          An important aspect of policy coherence is of course to ensure that trade and investment flows are not only dynamic and inclusive, but contribute to rising social and environmental well being in developing countries. Our current work programme in the DAC includes major projects in these areas. We are working to produce Guidelines for Donor Assistance to Poverty Reduction. And we are supporting the endeavours of developing countries to establish effective processes for defining and implementing national sustainable development strategies and to meet their commitments under global environment conventions. In this way, the development co-operation community is actively engaged, in a direct and practical way, in the social and environmental concerns that are important issues in the WTO forum. WT/COMTD/M/27 Page 12 Integrated Efforts to Enhance Capacity to Trade         The other area where the DAC and its members can provide input is in developing common donor approaches and enhancing bilateral donor efforts to build trade capacity in developing countries.         We are very much aware of the Integrated Framework for least developed countries' trade development and we maintain close contact with the co-ordinators from the different multilateral organisations involved.         Since 1997 we have organised two workshops in Paris on the subject of capacity development for trade in which we invited representatives of all six organisations, and we contributed a report to the WTO High Level Meeting in 1997 on the activities of bilateral donors in this area.          The stress given in the Integrated Framework to demand-led and locally owned approaches is fully in line with the orientations reflected in the DAC’s Development Partnership Strategy.          Given the importance of trade and development linkages, many bilateral donors are now striving to be more effective in their efforts to help the less advanced developing countries strengthen capacity to trade. The lessons we have learned from experience so far suggest strongly that successful trade development must consist of a concerted, multi-faceted approach that targets numerous actors, institutions and processes at the same time in an integrated and comprehensive manner.         This is not an easy approach when it comes to the level of operationalising it in the field.          We are therefore embarking on a project to prepare a set of good practices for donors in this area. In May of next year we will hold another workshop with representatives from the public and private sector in partner countries to test the good practices before they are finalised and disseminated at the end of next year.         Lessons learned from technical co-operation generally point to two critically important points.          First, donors need to tailor their strategies to the specific needs of the particular developing countries. Systemic needs assessments undertaken by the partner country in co-operation with the private sector must be the point of departure. Such assessments must be much more than shopping lists. They must embody the country’s own vision of how it can insert itself into market-driven, client-oriented patterns of trade in goods and services where value-added retained in the country is high.         This implies a significant agenda of policy development and institution building and an intensive dialogue between the Government and the private sector. It involves a heavy initial investment of time and effort, but ownership is essential for lasting impact.          DAC work in capacity building generally provides important guidance, including on strengthening the participation of the private sector and civil society in developing countries. Here is a fundamental point, the wealth of nations is built not on natural resources or cheap labour, but on institutional development which provides the framework of accountable and effective governance in both the public and private sectors, so that enterprise and human and social development can flourish on a sustainable basis. Technical assistance for trade capacity building thus goes well beyond the capacities needed to participate in the WTO.         Second, a locally owned, needs based approach requires a shared agenda and good co-ordination at the country level. This can be facilitated by designation of a lead donor or                                                                                    WT/COMTD/M/27                                                                                           Page 13 multilateral agency with a strong local presence and a comprehensive understanding of local institutions and policy issues. We cannot stress too strongly that donor efforts need to be more focused and coherent within each developing country. This requires real long-term commitment on both sides, appropriate expertise and the cultivation of a ""learning as you go"" culture rather than the delivery of pre-cooked generic packages. Our good practices will focus on this need for coherent and co-ordinated approaches keyed to specific country contexts.         We look forward to the participation of the relevant multilateral agencies and policymakers and other actors in developing countries as we elaborate these good practices.          I believe that my presence here today symbolises the emergence of a more systematic process of interaction between the trade community and the development co-operation community. We need to work at this interaction, it has to be a dynamic evolving process that we discuss and evaluate regularly.         Today we are in sense verifying that we are all attaching the same priority to the need for policy coherence in both developed and developing countries and to the role of trade capacity building. These are key building blocks for the future of a well-functioning global economy in which all countries can take part.                                              __________","WTCOMTDM27.pdf","Committee, Jean, Claude, Faure, Chairman, OECD, Development, Assistance, Committee, Committee, on, Trade, and, Development, Ambassador, Diallo, WTO, Committee, on, Trade, and, Development, Chairman, OECD, Committee, OECD, Chairman, Development, Assistance, Committee, DAC, DAC, OECD, Member, Member, OECD, Member, OECD, Organisation, OECD, Committee, DAC, Committee, UNDP, World, Bank, IMF, DAC, Washington, World, Bank, IMF, Director, IMF, M., Camdessus, UN, Conference, WTO, OECD, OECD, Council, OECD, DAC, Uruguay, Cologne, OECD, OECD, OECD, DAC, OECD, OECD, Paris, WTO, IMF, World, Bank, OECD, OECD, OECD, OECD, Members, DAC, Trade, Committee, Seattle, DAC, Member, Members, OECD, DAC, WTO, DAC, Paris, WTO, Integrated, Framework, DAC, DAC, WTO"

Those results would set out the priorities that the CTD should adopt, and nobody at the present CTD meeting wished to prejudge what would be decided at the Ministerial Meeting. As the Illustrative List did not have an official number, the CTD probably did not need to take any action on the document.

The first, mentioned by the EC, had also arisen in the Committee on Trade and Environment which had used the phrase ""pending the future work programme"". There, Members did not even want references to Third Ministerial Conference in Seattle. The delegation of Japan was right. There were several proposals which if accepted might or might not change the nature of the work in the CTD. Japan would obviously want to change the role of the CTD to that of an advisory role. India would not necessarily share this view at this point of time without understanding fully what an advisory role meant and what impact it would have on the various negotiating groups. In order to preserve Members' positions, India suggested that the Committee either went in one or two ways. One way approach might be to say ""pending the future work programme"". Otherwise, it would be necessary to go through the painful process of referring this document to the capitals and sitting down and negotiating. He supported the former approach, because those words had been used in another Committee which was at least similar if not the same. He proposed that the CTD stated ""pending the future work programme"" and then went on saying ""Illustrative List"" and that Members would come back to take a final decision at the first meeting in 2000.","WTCOMTDM27.pdf","India, Members, EC, Committee, on, Trade, and, Environment, Members, Seattle, Japan, CTD, Japan, CTD, India, Members, India, Committee, Committee, CTD, Members"

Nevertheless, he had the same concerns that had been raised by the EC and the United States. Members were, at this moment, in the preparatory process for the Ministerial Conference in Seattle. There were also substantial proposals, made in the drafting phase of the Ministerial Declaration, that were not reflected in the document, such as the proposal to elevate the LDC Sub-Committee to a full committee. If this were accepted, what would be the relationship between the CTD and the Committee on LDCs? Would the concerns of small economies be raised in the CTD or in the future possible Committee on LDCs? Another example was sustainable development which was very important for Japan, but which was not covered in the Illustrative List. The list was useful, but the Committee could not be seen to prejudge the outcome of the Ministerial Conference of Seattle. Therefore, the Illustrative List should be sent to capitals for consideration and then the CTD could revert to the issue after the Seattle in informal or formal mode.","WTCOMTDM27.pdf","Japan, Japan, EC, United, States, Members, Seattle, LDC, Sub-Committee, CTD, Committee, CTD, Committee, Japan, Committee, Seattle, CTD, Seattle"

For example, in paragraph (II) on capacity building there was a reference to a proposal having been made for a day of reflection on technical co-operation activities. In fact, several proposals had been made and this was being highlighted over others. She said that the United States would perhaps like to see other proposals listed in the Illustrative List at this time, pending the outcome in Seattle. Elements could even be added to this Illustrative List in Seattle. If the Committee went into this discussion at the present time or just put in a disclaimer, that would not do justice to the amount of work on proposals that had been already put in the General Council and in the preparatory process. She would have to see whether the proposal for a day of reflection was before the CTD or any other body. The United States with other delegations had made a proposal for a regular review of these issues in the General Council.

She drew attention to the fact that the Illustrative List brought together under four broad headings all the elements that had been previously discussed. However, she would appreciate hearing from the Committee on the priorities that Members attached to these four headings, for instance, elements that Members believed needed further work or areas in which the Committee could cooperate with other international institutions, such as the fiscal implications of liberalization, where the World Bank and the IMF had carried out significant studies. She asked what approaches the Committee might usefully follow. For example, did Members think it worthwhile having seminars that could be organized under the auspices of the CTD and at which with experts might be invited to present and discuss their studies with Members outside of the formal framework of discussions? The CTD also needed to look at special and differential treatment.

Therefore, she proposed that discussion be deferred until after Seattle, otherwise it would be necessary to include additional points based on suggestions of which Members were aware.","WTCOMTDM27.pdf","Secretariat, United, States, Committee, Chairperson, United, States, General, Council, for, Seattle, Seattle, Members"
"2279",2279,"27","27.      The representative of the WTO Secretariat said that the two studies mentioned by the Chairperson were close to finalization. The study on special and differential treatment had been more or less completed by the summer of 1999. However, the Secretariat had since received some additional information from other divisions of the Secretariat. This information referred to discussions on special and differential treatment in individual committees of the WTO. He stated that the Secretariat was on the very last stages of this paper, and he hoped that this paper could be made available to Members shortly. The second paper, relating to the participation of developing countries in the multilateral trading system, would be based on statistics on international trade available up to 1998 or 1999. The Secretariat was trying to include, as far as possible, data for 1999 to try to get some feel for the latest developments. The Secretariat did not want to look at only at the time of the financial crises and the immediate effect on the financial crises on trade of developing countries, which was obviously very important in 1998, but, hopefully, also to look at developments through the first seven or eight months of 1999. The first part of the paper was a very long term look at the development of developing countries trade since the beginning of the GATT 1948 up to the present time, and this would be based on the paper that the Secretariat had produced for the High Level Symposium in March 1999. The second part would take a look at developing countries' trade from 1990 to 1998, or least to the financial crises. The third part would try to analyse developments during                                                                                    WT/COMTD/M/27                                                                                            Page 5 and following the financial crises of 1997-98. The Secretariat had already drafted the second part of the paper and was now looking at the data for the third part. The Secretariat had not been able to complete the paper until now because reliable data were not been available for 1999; these were important to show the post-crisis developments.

The Chairperson recalled that the work programme of the CTD had been discussed at the previous meeting in July, based on an informal note by the Secretariat, and that, at that time, the Committee had dealt with the period to the Ministerial Conference in Seattle. Since then delegates had been focusing on the draft Ministerial Declaration for Seattle. Accordingly, she suggested that the Committee might look at what had been achieved hitherto and to have a preliminary discussion on what the Committee should do after Seattle. In her view, four main themes could be discerned under the Committee's terms of references: special and differential treatment; technical co-operation; participation of developing countries in multilateral trading system; and the experience of the developing countries with their own implementation and the implementation by their partners of WTO agreements. She also said that, at this stage, the Secretariat was completing two studies requested by the Committee: a paper on Special and Differential Treatment, of which a draft had been sent to Members, and a paper with updated statistics on the participation of developing countries in international trade. The Chairperson asked the Secretariat to inform the CTD on the progress of these studies.","WTCOMTDM27.pdf","Chairperson, CTD, Secretariat, Committee, Seattle, Seattle, Committee, Committee, Seattle, Committee, WTO, Secretariat, Committee, Members, Chairperson, Secretariat, CTD"

The representative of Guatemala noted that in the programme there were no changes to the programme of Trade Policy Courses that were normally held every two years for Spanish-speaking countries. He asked that more frequent courses for Spanish-speaking countries, once or even twice a year, be included in the three-year plan. Spanish-speaking countries had raised this concern on more than one occasion and they had sent a letter to the Director-General, Mr. Moore, on this subject. They hoped that their concerns would be taken into account.","WTCOMTDM27.pdf","Guatemala, Director-General, Moore"

The Chairperson recalled that, according to the guidelines adopted by CTD on 15 October 1996, the three-year plan for technical co-operation was to be presented to the CTD at its last Session of the year. The document WT/COMTD/W/64 was a first draft for the three-year plan, 2000-02. Given the critical financial technical assistance situation, as well as other issues, such as the launch of the ""Global Trust Fund"" for technical co-operation by some Members; the presentation of a number of proposals on the approach, the funding, the administration and evaluation of technical co-operation activities; the results of the Working Group on improved technical co-operation, which had been circulated in March 1999; and the decisions to be taken in Seattle, the Secretariat had decided that a conservative approach had to be taken in preparing the three-year plan. She also noted that the document raised several questions which needed to be examined, in particular, the broad guidelines for technical co-operation activities in 2000. Some specific activities, divided up by regions, could be found in Annex 1 of the WT/COMTD/W/64. For the years 2001 and 2002, the document gave some general vision in keeping with the spirit of continuity and it also contained some general information on priorities for the future. She suggested that, as the CTD had just received this document and bearing in mind the aforementioned considerations, the CTD come back to the issue at WT/COMTD/M/27 Page 4 its first meeting in 2000. In that way, the CTD would be able to take account of decisions taken in Seattle. Nevertheless, she asked if there were any comments on the subject.","WTCOMTDM27.pdf","Chairperson, CTD, CTD, Members, Working, Group, Seattle, Secretariat, CTD, CTD, CTD, Seattle"

He explained that the Secretariat had provided information on two options for the integration of a total of Frs. 10 million into the regular budget. Under one option, there was an expansion to Frs. 4 million in the first year, to be followed by two more equal annual increases of Frs. 3 million, over a total of three years. Under the second scenario, the full amount of Frs. 10 million would be integrated in one step. These scenarios had been proposed by Members in the General Council. The figures were also based on the budgetary proposals put forward by the Director-General for 2000 year, and did not take into account any changes that might result from the general review of the budget currently being undertaken in the Budget Committee. However, in any event the last column of each document would not change since it represented the difference (Frs. 4 million in the first table, and Frs. 10 million in the second) that was the impact of Members contribution in the integration of the Regular budget in the first year under the two scenarios.","WTCOMTDM27.pdf","WTO, Secretariat, Members, Secretariat, Members, General, Council, Director-General, Budget, Committee, Members"

The document distinguished three types of resources used for technical co-operation: the Regular Budget, Extra-Budgetary funds used for special activities and Other Extra-Budgetary funds.

The Committee had requested the Chairperson to bring this matter before the Committee on Budget, Finance and Administration (CBFA). Accordingly, at the informal meeting of the CBFA on 14 September 1999, the Chairperson of the CTD and a representative of the Secretariat gave an overview of the situation. The Chairperson thanked the Chairperson of the CBFA for organizing the informal Meeting of the CBFA and for the very positive exchanges of views that Members had on this subject.

A longer term perspective needed to take into account the fact that there had seemed to be a surplus at the end of 1998. It was also important to take into account the fact that forthcoming trade negotiations would place heavy demands on the human resources of the WTO Secretariat. One solution, from a longer term perspective, to the problem of adequate provisions of resources, both financial and human, for technical assistance lay in increased coherence with other international organisations, notably the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank.","WTCOMTDM26.pdf","Japan, Chairperson, Chairperson, Budget, Committee, WTO, Secretariat, International, Monetary, Fund, World, Bank"

He said that technical assistance was a means by which to integrate developing countries into the multilateral trading system, and was an integral part of the balance of rights and obligations. If the provision of technical assistance to developing countries was inadequate, they would not be in a position to accept new obligations, nor in a position to fully implement existing commitments. He also made reference to discussions that had taken place in the Committee on Market Access, and said that developing countries had been required to provide information to the Integrated Database. Developing countries could not meet this requirement owing to lack of capacity, and at the same time they were told that the funds were lacking to provide the necessary technical assistance. This was a glaring internal consistency in the working of the WTO. Finally, he said that while it was appropriate to thank donors for providing funding, it was also appropriate to encourage all developed trading partners to provide resources for the delivery of technical assistance.","WTCOMTDM26.pdf","Cuba, Egypt, Senegal, Mauritius, Committee, on, Market, Access, Integrated, Database, WTO"

He repeated that the situation surrounding the funding of technical assistance was alarming, and said that the response made by the European Communities, that they would seek to initiate action as soon as possible, would have been acceptable 6 months before when the issue was first raised. Egypt was very grateful for assistance received through the WTO, and funded by member states of the European Communities, as well as others. His delegation also acknowledged the contributions made by a number of European Members towards the establishment of the International Law Centre. However, one had to judge by observable results, and the truth of the matter was that the projected shortfall in the funding of technical assistance activities was not a new issue, but one that had been the subject of discussion for at least six months. He reiterated that major trading partners had major responsibilities, and that those that benefitted most from the multilateral trading system needed to be the biggest contributors. He repeated that the major component of funding for technical assistance activities came from Members that were not themselves major trading partners. His delegation held the view that adequate provision of technical assistance was a test by which to measure the commitment of developed country members to ensure the effective integration of developing and least-developed countries and the equitable distribution of the benefits of the multilateral trading system. He said it was therefore distressing that every report concerning the funding of technical assistance activities was worse than the preceding one, and added that his delegation would take up the issue at every possible occasion to ensure that it was properly addressed.","WTCOMTDM26.pdf","Egypt, European, Communities, Egypt, WTO, European, Communities, Members, Members"

"2245",2245,"9","9.      Mr. Burki highlighted the main points emphasised in the paper prepared by the Joint Task Force. The paper pointed out that small states had roughly the same per capita income and average income growth as large states, but suffered from considerable income volatility. It was important that small states be awarded transition periods, particularly in the light of developments in the area of trade and in the area of Official Development Assistance (ODA). The trade advantages enjoyed by small states resulted in part from preferential market access granted through a variety of arrangements. The evolving trading system threatened to erode the preferences that had worked favour of small states, which were now exposed to the detrimental effects of trade opening. More specifically, the establishment of other preferential trading arrangements and the development of the rules-based multilateral trading system under the aegis of the WTO had eroded the preference margins                                                                                    WT/COMTD/M/26                                                                                            Page 3 which small states had enjoyed. Preferences accorded through the Lomé Convention had lost their value as a result of the tariff cuts of recent years, and the WTO had introduced trade rules which were incompatible with the Lomé Convention. The recent dispute surrounding the banana régime of the European Union had showed how the establishment of the new trade system had created additional challenges for small states. Regarding the availability of ODA, the Joint Task Force had emphasised that ODA flows had been declining over recent years. In 1997, 21 OECD countries provided 0.22 per cent of their combined Gross national product, down from 0.25 per cent in 1996. Total overseas aid dropped from US$55 billion in 1996 to US$48 billion in 1997, but increased somewhat in 1998 as a result of the crises in Asia and Latin America. Aid from G7 countries had dropped by 30 per cent in real terms since 1992. The United States donated less than 0.1 per cent of its GNP as ODA. Small states therefore had to rely on a combination of domestic and foreign savings and private external flows, in order to finance their development. While the fall in ODA had been compensated for by the increase in flows of private external finance, the change in composition of foreign financing meant that the cost of external financing was higher. Furthermore, private external finance was not always available in the quantity required by small states.","WTCOMTDM26.pdf","Burki, Joint, Task, Force, ODA, WTO, WTO, European, Union, ODA, Joint, Task, Force, ODA, OECD, Asia, Latin, America, United, States, ODA, ODA"

Developing countries could not take on board additional obligations without technical assistance. While his delegation were sympathetic to the constraints faced by the Technical Cooperation Division, they did not share the view that outsourcing was necessarily a solution, on the basis that external resource persons often lacked a detailed knowledge of the multilateral trading system, when compared to in-house experts.

It was untrue for some delegations to assert that donors such as the European Communities were not taking the problem seriously; the bulk of financing for technical assistance came from the European Communities. He also recalled that at the High Level Symposium on Trade and Development, two Member States of the Communities had each pledged an extra CHF1 million at the meeting. He said that it was of no use to start a polemic regarding the funding of technical assistance, as this would detract from the seriousness of the issue.","WTCOMTDM26.pdf","European, Communities, Egypt, Trade, and, Development, Member"

The representative of Norway recalled that his delegation had intervened at length on this issue in a previous meeting, and reiterated the importance of funding technical assistance through the regular budget. He said that the establishment of the Global Trust Fund was an intermediate solution which would improve the management of technical assistance, and since his delegation had participated in drafting the modalities for the fund it would disburse its extra budgetary contributions through the fund. He emphasised that the Global trust Fund would not on its own solve the fundamental problem of long term budget planning as this required that all funds be disbursed through the regular budget.

He recalled the commitment in the Agreement Establishing the WTO to ensure that developing countries, including least-developed countries, benefitted from a share in the increase in world trade that was commensurate with their development needs. It was universally recognised that technical assistance was one means by which the increased participation of developing countries, and least-developed countries, in world trade could be achieved. It was therefore important that technical assistance provided was of good quality and had a concrete impact on the trade of developing countries. He said that the needs of developing countries were increasing, while the technical assistance resources availed to them were diminishing. From this point, his delegation had a number of proposals. First it was absolutely necessary that WTO members reaffirmed their commitment to Technical Assistance activities that would respond to the needs of developing countries, including least-developed countries Second, it was necessary to respond to financial constraints by incorporating the funding of Technical assistance activities through the regular budget. Third, it was necessary to address the financial constraints affecting the WTO, by establishing a floor for resources (say, CHF10 million) allocated to technical assistance activities, without prejudice to further funding from extra budgetary sources. Finally, the WTO should organise on an annual basis a day devoted to reflection by members on the issue of technical assistance, which would cover a range of issues such as financing, the delivery of technical assistance and an assessment of its impact.","WTCOMTDM26.pdf","Senegal, Egypt, African, Group, WTO, WTO, WTO, WTO"
"2236",2236,"81","81.     The representative of Egypt said his delegation were disturbed by the alarming picture presented by Mr. Léger, and expressed their extreme disappointment at the situation. Extra-budgetary contributions were made by a small number of donors who were not on the whole major trading partners. Technical assistance was an important part of the overall balance of rights and obligations of the Uruguay Round Agreements. Referring to the comments made by the European Communities, he said that donors should take the funding difficulties more seriously. The paper prepared by Mr. Léger should address possible solutions to financing problems. The representative of Egypt said that those members who were talking about comprehensive negotiations, and about further commitments, needed to be aware that developing countries would have great difficulties in accepting new commitments while they experienced difficulties with existing commitments, and technical assistance was not forthcoming.","WTCOMTDM26.pdf","Egypt, Léger, Uruguay, European, Communities, Léger, Egypt"
"2235",2235,"80","80.     The representatives of the European Communities said that his delegation were very concerned about the financial situation of technical cooperation activities. His delegation had understood that the Budget and Finance Committee had not pronounced itself on this issue, and had WT/COMTD/M/26 Page 18 not had an in-depth discussion on the issue. He supported the idea put forward by Mr. Léger that the secretariat prepare a paper presenting information on the financial situation, as this be helpful in initiating action from the capitals as soon as was possible.","WTCOMTDM26.pdf","European, Communities, Budget, and, Finance, Committee, Léger"

Mr Burki thanked the Members of the CTD for inviting the Joint Task Force, and said he wished to make a few remarks regarding the origins of the Task Force; where the Task Force was in terms of presenting a paper for discussion in various fora; the conclusions reached jointly by the Commonwealth Secretariat and the World Bank; and the expectations of the Joint Task Force with regard to the 26th Session of the CTD. The origins of the Joint Task Force dated back to July 1998 when a group of Commonwealth Ministers visited the World Bank and requested that a Task Force on Small States be organised. The Joint Task Force had met on three occasions between October 1998 and April 1999. At its last meeting it agreed to produce a paper which would cover four items as follows: (i) background information on why the Joint Task Force was set up, the domestic policies of small states and the past performance of international institutions towards them; (ii) analysis of the vulnerability and the volatility of income of small states; (iii) the major transformation of the international economic and financial order, and the manner in which international community could assist small states in their transition in the new international environment; and (iv) the development of specific policy recommendations by the Commonwealth Secretariat, the World Bank, and it was hoped, by the WTO, the European Union and the International Monetary Fund.","WTCOMTDM26.pdf","Burki, Members, CTD, Joint, Task, Force, Commonwealth, Secretariat, World, Bank, Joint, Task, Force, CTD, Joint, Task, Force, Commonwealth, World, Bank, Joint, Task, Force, Joint, Task, Force, Commonwealth, Secretariat, World, Bank, WTO, European, Union, International, Monetary, Fund"

The representative of New Zealand thanked Mr. Léger for his presentation, and said that her delegation was disturbed by the poor financial situation affecting technical cooperation activities. She said that New Zealand had made an additional contribution of CHF130,000, and that a similar contribution was to be made in August 1999 specifically for activities in the Asia-Pacific region. She hoped that other Members would take heed of Mr. Léger's comments and find additional funds in their budgets.","WTCOMTDM26.pdf","New, Zealand, Léger, New, Zealand, Asia-Pacific, Members, Léger"
"2232",2232,"78","78.      Mr. Léger said the establishment of the Global Trust Fund for WTO Technical Cooperation is an important initiative to achieve a more efficient management and implementation of WTO technical cooperation activities. However, as stated in the preamble to the Memorandum of Understanding establishing the Global Trust Fund, this initiative was not a replacement for an adequately funded WTO regular budget for technical cooperation.","WTCOMTDM26.pdf","Léger, Global, Trust, Fund, WTO, WTO, WTO"
"2231",2231,"77","77.     Mr. Léger said that the Secretariat remained firmly committed to augmenting the availability of technical cooperation through out-sourcing. He reaffirmed the Secretariat's intention to continue to work closely with other international organizations, and to enlarge the scope of application to allow the engagement of external consultants to supplement its work. However, it was not possible to out- source all subjects, and the need would remain for a WTO presence in regional and national seminars. Out-sourcing through consultancy contracts, would further increase the financial requirements for technical assistance.","WTCOMTDM26.pdf","Léger, Secretariat, Secretariat, WTO"
"2230",2230,"76","76.      Mr. Léger said that when the Secretariat last presented the financial situation regarding technical assistance on 4 June 1999, a shortfall of CHF 2.6 million was projected for 1999. On projected expenditures of CHF9.4 million for 1999, already 60 per cent had been committed at that time. The situation was even worse one month later, at the time of the 26th Session. On a cashflow basis, that is, assuming that no additional funding were received in 1999 through extra-budgetary contributions, the available funds had already been entirely committed. In other words, the Secretariat was not in a position to respond positively to any new request for technical assistance in 1999 unless, of course, additional funding was forthcoming (refer to Annex). The financial constraints being faced in 1999 were first announced to the Budget Committee on 25 March 1999 in document CRP(99)07. Owing to the inadequate nature of the regular WTO budget for technical assistance, it had become becomes highly difficult for the Secretariat to undertake any serious planning, even in the short term, and impossible to envisage on-going programmes, when 90 per cent of projected expenditure for 1999 were financed through yearly ad hoc grants which, in turn, were subject to each Member's financial situation and priorities, introducing volatility in the funding process.","WTCOMTDM26.pdf","Léger, Secretariat, Secretariat, Budget, Committee, WTO, Secretariat, Member"
"2229",2229,"75","75.      Mr. Léger said that the importance of technical assistance in terms of capacity and institutional building was recognized in many of the technical assistance provisions included in WTO Agreements, as part of ""Special and Differential Treatment"", and had also been confirmed by Ministers in past WTO Conferences. It was also realized that the ability of developing country                                                                                     WT/COMTD/M/26                                                                                            Page 17 Members to meet their obligations and commitments remained, at least partly, contingent on the provision of adequate and satisfactory technical assistance. Notwithstanding the high priority accorded to technical cooperation, the Regular WTO Budget for technical assistance had remained at the same level during the past four years, that is, at CHF741,000. Only through extra-budgetary contributions had the Secretariat been able to fulfill many of the requests for technical assistance from least-developed countries, developing countries and economies in transition. Even regarding the least-developed countries, to which high priority was attached, the 1997 High-Level Meeting did not result in any new financing to implement the Integrated Framework. In addition, the High-Level Meeting also endorsed two other recommendations affecting LDCs. These concerned the need to assist least-developed countries in the process of accession, and the need to provide assistance in preparing their Trade Policy Reviews. No additional resources had been made available for these programmes either. Furthermore, the growing Membership of WTO was likely to result in a further increase in technical assistance.","WTCOMTDM26.pdf","Léger, WTO, WTO, Conferences, Members, WTO, Budget, Secretariat, WTO"

The Chairperson recalled that Mr. Jean-Maurice Léger had, on the occasion of the 25th Session of the CTD, made a presentation regarding technical cooperation activities held by the Secretariat, and in particular, on the budgetary difficulties encountered in this context. She said a number of Members were of the view that it was important to provide technical cooperation activities with a more solid budgetary base and, in particular, to incorporate, technical cooperation activities into the regular budget of the WTO. She said that she as aware that, since the 25th Session of the CTD, the African Group had held discussion on this subject. She therefore invited Mr. Léger to provide Members with an update on progress made on the subject of technical cooperation activities and their funding since the 25th Session.","WTCOMTDM26.pdf","Chairperson, Jean-Maurice, Léger, CTD, Secretariat, Members, WTO, CTD, African, Group, Léger, Members"

Mr. Lanvin informed CTD that a meeting of an UNCTAD working group of legal and regulation experts was planned for 14-16 July 1999 to address issues relating to electronic commerce and development. The fourth session of the UNCTAD on electronic commerce was planned for 19-23 July 1999, in order to discuss developments since UNCTAD IX and possible themes for UNCTAD X. Mr. Lanvin said that since the launching of UNCTAD's work on electronic commerce in 1994, the organisation had followed a cooperative approach, and had invited organisations and agencies with competencies in a number of different areas. Thus both the WTO and the WIPO were invited to the meetings planned for 19-23 July. The UNCTAD had also enjoyed reciprocal treatment from a number of organisations.","WTCOMTDM26.pdf","Lanvin, CTD, UNCTAD, UNCTAD, UNCTAD, UNCTAD, Lanvin, UNCTAD, WTO, WIPO, UNCTAD"

He informed the CTD that a workshop had been held at the national level in Caracas, Venezuela from 28-29 June 1999. The workshop was geared to the development of national strategies for electronic commerce and drew on many of the conclusions adopted at the workshop of 17-18 June he had just presented. The Caracas seminar had led to the creation of a national working group involving private sector and public sector participants, which sought to develop the legal, technical, economic and fiscal details of the overall strategy for electronic commerce. It was intended that the results of the workshop held in Caracas feed into a regional meeting on electronic commerce for Latin American and Caribbean countries programmed for 4-5 August in Lima, Peru. This regional meeting was one of three regional meetings planned by the UNCTAD for 1999, the other two being programmed for October 1999 for the African and Asia Pacific regions, to be held respectively in Kenya and Sri Lanka.","WTCOMTDM26.pdf","Lanvin, UNCTAD, CTD, Caracas, Venezuela, Caracas, Caracas, Caribbean, Lima, Peru, UNCTAD, Asia, Pacific, Kenya, Sri, Lanka"

The report would also be made available on the UNCTAD web-site, and it was hoped WT/COMTD/M/26 Page 16 that the web-site for the workshop would serve as a focal point for discussion between experts from the private and public sector interested in the question of electronic commerce and development.","WTCOMTDM26.pdf","Lanvin, UNCTAD"
"2221",2221,"68","68.      Mr. Lanvin said that the second part of the of the workshop devoted to areas of action identified four domains. The first concerned the facilitation of access and the reduction of access costs relating to electronic commerce infrastructure and the internet. It was noted that innovative policy approaches were in place in a number of developing countries. In this context, the exchange of information between countries that had already put their approaches in place and those that were still at the drawing board, was of great value. Second, it was noted that in order to stimulate the participation of developing country enterprises, and particularly SMEs, in electronic commerce, links had to be developed between the virtual world of electronic commerce transactions and the physical world of transactions in goods. While it was clear that trade in services benefitted clearly from electronic commerce, developing countries were liable to rely heavily on trade in manufactures and raw materials and that in this context it was necessary to address issues such as transport, payment and customs formalities as components of an overall strategy. Third, the issue of confidence building was addressed, particularly regarding the security of transactions and payments. Examples of innovative policy approaches were noted. The need to enable SMEs to engage in electronic commerce through modalities that were familiar, notably the use of local languages to describe conditions of sale and offer, was emphasised. Fourth, evidence from countries that had implemented strategies for the development of electronic commerce pointed to the need to develop a national electronic commerce culture. The embryonic nature of regional strategies was noted, and the possibility of using existing regional structures, notably in regard to customs, was emphasised.","WTCOMTDM26.pdf","Lanvin"
"2220",2220,"67","67.      Mr. Lanvin said that the workshop was the first of its type in the context of preparations for UNCTAD X. The working group of experts had addressed two fundamental aspects of electronic commerce as it related to the work of enterprises in developing countries: that is, an assessment of the current state of play, and second the identification of areas of action to enhance the participation of developing country enterprises in electronic commerce. In connection with the first rubric, he said that presentations had been made, notably by the ITU, which provided up to date data on infrastructure, internet connectivity and relative costs of electronic commerce in developing countries. It was noted that situations diverged widely between developing countries, and that a number of issues that went well beyond the subject of electronic commerce had to be addressed in order to enhance the participation of developing country enterprises, and notably small and medium enterprises (SMEs), in electronic commerce. Key priority issues included the deregulation of the telecommunications sector and competition policy in relation to internet access. A significant place was given to the direct exchange of experiences between companies that were either users of electronic commerce or service providers to electronic commerce users. Experts present included a number from advanced countries, but also least-developed countries such as Nepal and Benin. A special session had also been held on domain names. A number of experts involved in the ICAN process updated the meeting regarding the latest developments in the area. Experts from the WIPO had made a presentation on the link between domain names and trademarks.","WTCOMTDM26.pdf","Lanvin, ITU, Nepal, Benin, ICAN, WIPO"

He said that the paper should be called a progress report, in order to be consistent with the work done in other committees and to reflect the fact that the CTD had not finished its work on electronic commerce. Regarding paragraph 7, he said that the words ""electronic commerce"" should be replaced by the words ""information technology"", since it was the latter rather than electronic commerce that was the means for conducting trade facilitation. Alternatively, if this substitution could not be made, a sentence could be added to the effect that some members did not believe that the discussion of electronic commerce and trade facilitation fell under the current work programme, since they were of the view that electronic commerce had little to do with trade facilitation. Regarding paragraph 11, he said the wording of the last sentence seemed to indicate that there was a link between the absence competition laws and policies and problems in the use of development assistance funds, and added that it was unclear how one would affect the other. Regarding paragraph 15, the representative of Brazil said that the issue of taxation was one of national economic policy – particularly with respect to the development of the domestic information technology industry – and not limited to the concept of sovereignty. Regarding paragraph 16, he asked why mention was made, in the 7th line, of the WTO. In order to be consistent, either this reference to the WTO had to be deleted, or mention had to be made of the WTO in all other areas cited in paragraph 16.","WTCOMTDM26.pdf","Brazil, CTD, CTD, Brazil, WTO, WTO, WTO"

The representative of Korea said that Article XX exceptions (under GATT 1947) provided for the fact that the content of GATT should not damage the public order. His delegation had raised the question in view of the fact that the contents of e-commerce could be affected by this article, even though it was unclear as to whether Article XX could be feasible applied given the nature of electronic commerce.","WTCOMTDM26.pdf","Korea, United, States, CTD, Korea, GATT, GATT"

A number of delegations had expressed their concerns regarding the format and content of the document Electronic Commerce and Development (Job No. 2987), which summarised points regarding Electronic Commerce made in meetings of the CTD and during the Seminar on Electronic Commerce. It had been agreed that the Secretariat would undertake further work on the document, taking into account points made by Members at the 25th Session. The Secretariat also undertook further consultations with delegations that intervened during the CTD meeting on 16 June, and set the 25 June as a deadline for written submissions to be incorporated in the document. Members should therefore have had ample opportunity to provide an input into the preparation of the revised document. The Secretariat had produced a new document (Job No. 3943), which took account of the comments and contributions made by Members. The document had been circulated to Members at the beginning of this week, and the Chairperson asked if members had any comments to make regarding the document.","WTCOMTDM26.pdf","Chairperson, CTD, Electronic, Commerce, and, Development, Electronic, Commerce, CTD, Secretariat, Members, Secretariat, CTD, Members, Secretariat, Members, Members, Chairperson"

Mr. Bélisle, referring to the statement made by the representative of Mexico, said that regional activities were funded through the regular budget, and were for the benefit of all regions equally and without distinction. Specific projects undertaken at the national level were funded through extra-budgetary sources. Regarding partnerships with civil society, he said that the ITC worked principally with civil society, that is, the private sector, academia and, more recently, with NGOs. The ITC had developed networks with the academic community with a view to improving the implementation of programmes, including training programmes. The ITC had a programme known as Export Led Poverty Alleviation, and the ITC had sought to draw in NGOs in the implementation of this programme. Regarding the Executive Forum on National Export Strategies to be held in September 1999, he said that the intention was to bring together about 13 countries to participate in four days of brainstorming on trade promotion. A number of countries had asked the ITC to present examples of countries that had been successfully in trade promotion. The selection of countries made was on the basis, amongst other things, of region, and in order to ensure that LDCs, developing countries and countries in transition were represented. Countries were invited only if the ITC was satisfied that both the representative from the business community and that from government were able to make a substantive contribution. It was the intention of the ITC to publish the proceedings of the meetings, and he hoped that the meeting would be repeated on an annual basis. Regarding support received from the donors, the fact that developing countries were counted amongst donors, showed the importance of the ITC to developing countries. He acknowledged the support the representative of Norway had announced, and added that Norway had recently organised consultations relating to the implementation of private sector development strategies in developing countries and the role of the ITC.","WTCOMTDM26.pdf","Bélisle, Mexico, ITC, ITC, ITC, ITC, ITC, ITC, ITC, ITC, Norway, Norway, ITC"

He said that the ITC needed further resources to comprehensively address the needs of developing countries, and particularly the least-developed countries. His delegation commended the ITC, the UNCTAD, and the WTO for their close collaboration, and expressed the hope that the three other organisations participating in the Integrated Framework for Trade-Related Technical Assistance, would follow this example. He said that a certain reluctance was detected on the part of certain agencies to take part fully in the Integrated Framework, and, taking Haiti as an example, cited the World bank as one agency that was particularly hesitant.

It was also recognised that the operationalisation of the Integrated Framework was a challenge that required the full and constant commitment of all actors, and particularly LDCs. Commenting on the ITC's Annual Report, several representatives recommended a more evaluative and analytical approach focusing on objectives and results, and assessments by beneficiaries of the support they had received.              Finally, the government representatives had announced confirmed or possible voluntary contributions to ITC. These were: Canada, China, Denmark, France, Germany, India, the Netherlands, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland, the United Kingdom, Côte d'Ivoire, Greece, Ireland, Italy and Belgium.

Ambassador Noirfalisse said that the Thirty-Second Session of the Joint Advisory Board had demonstrated the close collaboration that existed between the UNCTAD, the WTO, and the ITC. Furthermore, it demonstrated that the reform of the ITC was complete. This was welcomed by the representatives to the JAG. The capacity of the ITC to meet the needs of its core clients was emphasised. An effort had been made to distinguish between two fundamental programmes of the ITC, namely the Joint ITC/UNCTAD/WTO/Integrated Technical Assistance Programme in Selected Least-Developed and Other African Countries ( JITAP), and the Integrated Framework for Trade-Related Technical Assistance to Least-Developed Countries. Regarding the latter, the pivotal role of the ITC in coordinating and managing activities which involved the six agencies was highlighted by representatives. The interaction between the ITC and the other agencies was an example of coherence in policy-making between institutions. Members had stressed the importance of striking a balance between inter-regional, regional and national programmes. Concerns had been expressed about the decline in extra-budgetary resources, and also regarding the marginalisation of least-developed countries in the process of globalisation. The importance project coordination at the conceptual phase, as well as the execution stage, was stressed. The ITC was encouraged to strengthen its cooperation with other United Nations organisations such as UNIDO and the ILO, as well as with the Bretton Woods institutions, and to develop partnerships with civil society.","WTCOMTDM26.pdf","Ambassador, Noirfalisse, Joint, Advisory, Board, UNCTAD, WTO, ITC, ITC, ITC, ITC, Joint, ITC/UNCTAD/WTO, /, Integrated, Technical, Assistance, Programme, Integrated, Framework, for, Trade-Related, Technical, Assistance, ITC, ITC, Members, ITC, United, Nations, UNIDO, ILO, Bretton, Woods"

He said that the Sun City Workshop had been aimed at preparing proposals as inputs to the third Ministerial Conference. He had presented these formally to the General Council. He said that the Sun City meeting had reviewed the implementation of Uruguay Round Agreements by least-developed countries, and had evaluated the impact of the agreements on the trade and development prospects of the least-developed countries. It also addressed the need to enhance the capacity of least-developed countries to participate in global trade and rule making, and also the need to identify issues of interest to least-developed countries to promote and safeguard potential benefits, and to protect such countries from possible risks and losses. The meeting formulated a Comprehensive New Plan of Action (CNPA) aimed at integrating least-developed countries into the multilateral trading system. The proposals contained in the CNPA covered a broad range of issues of key interest to least-developed countries. These proposals were sharp, succinct and entirely de-ideologised, and were the product of very business-like discussions. A copy of the CNPA had already been made available to the Secretariat.

Regarding definitional issues, he said that there was no intent to be exclusive, and stressed that the draft report focussed on certain stylised facts relating to vulnerability. He said that there were aspects of vulnerability that ran across an unbroken continuum. He said that there was no call for there to be a small group of countries which benefitted from certain exclusive rights, but rather that there should be a recognition that small states as described in the draft report suffered from specific problems.

"2178",2178,"29","29.      Mr Burki said, in response to a question raised by the representative of Bolivia, that there was no contradiction between the promotion of creditworthiness on the one hand, and the point made about graduation thresholds on the other, and added that the one point supported the other. He said, for instance, that if a country was about to graduate from concessional lending through IDA and it was determined that that country had some of the characteristics that justified flexibility, then that country would continue to benefit from IDA lending, which would in turn bolster its credit worthiness. Regarding the question raised by the representative of Bolivia regarding successful restructuring, Mr. Burki referred to the Bolivian experience under President Banzer which was based, in part, on exploiting the comparative advantage of the country. The World Bank had associated itself with the strategy, and had also introduced its comprehensive development framework. Regarding definitional issues, he emphasised that the Joint Task Force had deliberately chosen not to be precise when making lists of countries, and had focused instead on presenting a certain number of stylised facts. It had deliberately chose to use the term small states since it focused on the absorptive capacity of these states to, amongst other things, deal with foreign assistance, access markets, or to bring about                                                                                      WT/COMTD/M/26                                                                                              Page 9 change. It was left to international organisations to decide for themselves what criteria they would use to tackle problems posed by smallness and vulnerability. The World Bank had for its part decided to use its thresholds in a flexible way, and that its approach would be informed by the Vulnerability Index.","WTCOMTDM26.pdf","Burki, Bolivia, IDA, IDA, Bolivia, Burki, Banzer, World, Bank, Joint, Task, Force, World, Bank"

The representative of Mauritius thanked Mr. Burki and Sir Humphrey for their presentations, and added that further time for reflection regarding the contents of the draft report was necessary. He said the linkage between issues related to smallness and vulnerability, on one hand, and trade, on the other, needed to be clearly spelled out. He noted that Mauritius had been used as a case-study, and said that the attempt to draw a parallel with Cyprus did not highlight the distinctive differences between the two countries. Cyprus was close to its main markets by virtue of its geographical location, whereas Mauritius was outside the main air and sea transport routes. He said that the period of unprecedented growth experienced by Mauritius was a result of, amongst other things, the strategic alliances it had forged with it main trading partners. A key element of these partnerships was the Lomé Convention. He said the comparative advantage of Mauritius was propelled by such preferential frameworks. He said that while Mauritius recognised that it could not depend in perpetuity on preferences, and that preferential systems had to be compatible with WTO rules, it still remained a vulnerable economy.","WTCOMTDM26.pdf","Mauritius, Burki, Humphrey, Mauritius, Cyprus, Cyprus, Mauritius, Mauritius, Mauritius, Mauritius, WTO"

She said that the draft report was a clear and concise document which was particularly useful as an exercise in awareness building. She said that if the issue of vulnerability was new to the WTO, it was not in itself a new issue, as discussions regarding vulnerability had been held for over 15 years. She said that it would be more appropriate to speak of small economies rather than small states in the context of the WTO. She said that small states were compelled to look outwards, and that integration into international trade was not an option but an imperative. The key issue lay in enhancing the capacity of small economies to become full and active participants in the international economy. To this end, her delegation encouraged the WTO to examine ways and means of taking into account the specificities of small economies. She drew attention to the problems of preference erosion faced by the small economies, and the negative impact WTO agreements sometimes had on WT/COMTD/M/26 Page 8 the interests of small economies, as evidenced by the recent banana crisis.

The representative of Cuba thanked Mr. Burki and Sir Humphrey for their presentation, and said that rather than referring to small states, the concepts of small economies and vulnerability should be made use of, as they reflected the situation of many Members of the WTO. The concept of small states excluded a number of small economies whose present difficulties required special and differential treatment. His delegation believed that vulnerability was the defining factor, and cited the example of Caribbean countries which were prone to natural disasters on a yearly basis. He said that the issue of real access to world markets needed to be taken into account. He noted that Cuba did not appear in either Table 1 or Table 2 of the draft report, whereas Cuba did appear on a list of vulnerable countries prepared by the World Bank.","WTCOMTDM26.pdf","Cuba, Burki, Humphrey, Members, WTO, Caribbean, Cuba, Cuba, World, Bank"
"2171",2171,"22","22.      The representative of Egypt expressed the strong support of his delegation for efforts to understand the problems and limitations of small economies. He said that issues of concern to small states were related to a number of issues which were being addressed by the CTD, such as technical assistance, special and differential treatment and so forth. He said that given the WTO was a rules based system, if small economies or any other Members were to have any rights, these had to be inscribed in the rules. The most important issue however was gaining an understanding of the limitations of small economies, and in this context the draft report was of great value. He recalled that Egypt's approach to the question of special and differential treatment stressed that provisions for special and differential treatment needed to be more targeted to address the needs of different groups of countries. He recalled the statement made in a previous meeting by the representative of Dominica that it was difficult for a country like Dominica to implement the TRIPS Agreement in its entirety with all its costs in the same manner as a developed country. A key question therefore related to the manner in which multilateral organisations dealing with trade issues could accommodate the interests of small economies. To this end, the Vulnerability Index and it components could be put to use within the context of the WTO. The Vulnerability Index was also of use in addressing problems faced by developing countries in general. He noted that one component of the index was lack of export diversification. An approach needed to be found within the WTO, in terms of rights and obligation, that met the concerns of Members that suffered from a lack of export diversification. The representative of Egypt noted that the report pointed to the presence of important transition costs, and also to the fact that vulnerability was independent of income. He also noted that some small states would remain small regardless of any other developments, and that consequently an approach was needed which dealt specifically with the problems of small states. He said his delegation supported the preparation of a paper by the Secretariat which examined the trade structure of small economies and their vulnerability in order to facilitate the understanding of the issues faced by small economies. Finally, he said that his delegation shared the concerns expressed in the Draft Report regarding difficulties which affected small economies in connection with accession, and in connection with participation in the Dispute Settlement Mechanism. He hoped that the creation of an Advisory Centre on WTO, Law which his delegation supported, would be of assistance in this regard.","WTCOMTDM26.pdf","Egypt, CTD, WTO, Members, Egypt, Dominica, Dominica, WTO, WTO, Members, Egypt, Secretariat, WTO"

He noted, however, that Guatemala had a population of over 1.5 million and said that the concept of small states should be broadened. He said that this was not a question of establishing new categories, but rather an exercise in understanding the limitation and constraints affecting small economies, and seeking appropriate mechanisms to ensure that they benefitted fully from participation in international trade. Aspects which were of particular interest to small economies included market access for products of export interest, the transfer of technologies, technical assistance and special and differential treatment. He said that in the process of creation of the Free-Trade Area of the Americas, a consultative group on small economies had been established, in order that the concerns of small economies that were participating in trade negotiations in the region be taken into account. He said this was a similar process to that which would be undertaken shortly in the WTO example, and therefore provided useful lessons of experience on which the WTO could draw. He concluded by saying that his                                                                                     WT/COMTD/M/26                                                                                             Page 7 delegation were aware the greater part of responsibility fell on small economies to develop their own policies and strategies which would enable their full participation in international trade.","WTCOMTDM26.pdf","Guatemala, Humphrey, Burki, Guatemala, Americas, WTO, WTO"

The representative of Haiti thanked Mr. Burki and Sir Humphrey for their presentation, and said that his delegation appreciated the fact that the Commonwealth Secretariat, in its study, did not differentiate between small states and small economies belonging to the Commonwealth, and those that did not. He said that the concept of vulnerability furthered the recognition of the issues faced by small economies. His delegation were nevertheless preoccupied by the manner in which the question of small economies was handled. While the Commonwealth Secretariat and the World Bank spoke of small states, the Ministerial Conference of the WTO had referred to small economies. His delegation hoped that the Secretariat would find the means to develop a definition that would be of satisfaction to the WTO and to the UN system, which would take into account the problems of small economies and notably the concept of vulnerability. This last concept was important given the number of highly developed small states that were Members of the WTO. The representative of Haiti also drew attention to the fact that certain small states, including Haiti, were particularly prone to suffer from natural disasters. Regarding the question of ODA, he recalled that the United Nations had recommended that flows of ODA be not less than 0.7 per cent of GNP, and said that it was therefore the low levels of aid flows from OECD countries was cause for concern. He appealed to the Commonwealth Secretariat to urge those countries that had committed themselves to providing the equivalent of 0.7 per cent of GNP in ODA to adhere to these commitments, to ensure that developing countries, and small economies in particular, received that to which they were entitled. This would in turn make available the necessary funds to address the marginalisation of small economies. Finally, he said that whereas least-developed countries were given recognition, such recognition had not yet been given to small economies. Such recognition was important if small economies were to exercise their rights.","WTCOMTDM26.pdf","Haiti, Burki, Humphrey, Commonwealth, Secretariat, Commonwealth, Commonwealth, Secretariat, World, Bank, WTO, Secretariat, WTO, UN, Members, WTO, Haiti, Haiti, ODA, United, Nations, ODA, OECD, Commonwealth, Secretariat"

The representative of Barbados joined the delegation of Bolivia in welcoming the Task Force, and thanked Mr. Burki and Sir Humphrey for their presentations, notably the presentation of the Vulnerability Index and its relevance to the work of the WTO. She said her delegation was of the view that the draft report presented to the CTD provided very useful material on the vulnerability and other characteristics of small states, on the development challenges faced by small states, and on the strategies and innovative approaches which small states and institutions, including the WTO, could adopt when attempting to address the inherent difficulties faced by small states in regard to participation in the multilateral trading system. She said her delegation had spoken repeatedly on the vulnerability of small economies, on their development problems, and on the difficulties faced by small economies in achieving full integration into the multilateral trading system. It was therefore heartening to hear from the Task Force that the WTO needed to take recognise that small economies faced specific challenges in adjusting to multilateral trade liberalisation. Her delegation wished to endorse the call made by Sir Humphrey that Ministers discuss the issue of small economies in the Third Ministerial Conference, with a view to including the issue of small economies in the WTO work programme. She said that this suggestion should be formally included in the input of the CTD into the preparatory process for the Third Ministerial Conference.","WTCOMTDM26.pdf","Barbados, Bolivia, Burki, Humphrey, WTO, CTD, WTO, WTO, Humphrey, WTO, CTD"
"2166",2166,"18","18.      The representative of Bolivia thanked Mr. Burki and Sir Humphrey for their presentations. She said that small economies had difficulties in coming to grips with the tentacular nature of the multilateral trading system, with all its implications for small economies. She recalled that Bolivia had worked, in the context of the Geneva Ministerial Conference, towards the introduction of the concept of small economies. While Bolivia did not identify itself with the criteria applied by the Commonwealth Secretariat and the World Bank to define another concept, that of small states, Bolivia did identify itself with a number of the issues raised in the paper, which was itself a useful document that would enable a further examination of issues of interest to small economies. Regarding the ten points discussed by Mr. Burki, she asked whether the point about credit worthiness was not in contradiction with the point on the use of the vulnerability index in determining graduation thresholds. In connection with the point regarding the restructuring of small economies and the need for human development and greater stability, she asked whether the international community had a commitment to work towards greater stability, and whether other countries had demonstrated a will for restructuring, and cited as an example the difficulties encountered in restructuring the market for agricultural products. She said that Bolivia had undertaken extensive efforts in restructuring, and had incurred high social costs in the process, and that Bolivia wished to see an example of restructuring in areas of export interest to it. She said there were, to the contrary, attempts to introduce measures which would slow down the restructuring of such markets, and which caused countries like Bolivia to depend more on preferences. She noted that there had been a reference to the need to facilitate the process of transition which small economies needed to undergo. Transition would be facilitated if there was a systemic response as whole to problems of transition. The simple recourse to ad hoc measures was liable to jeopardise, in the medium term, the establishment of such a comprehensive approach to problems of transition.

"2164",2164,"16","16.      Sir Humphrey said it was the intention of the Commonwealth Secretariat to follow up the implementation of the Task Force recommendations by encouraging all the leading international institutions to develop their action programmes to support small states. This of course included the WTO. The Commonwealth Secretariat and the World Bank believed the WTO could make a key contribution to smoothing the transitional problems of small states. To this end, he advanced four thoughts for the consideration of the WTO for action, which would complement the actions of the Commonwealth Secretariat and the World Bank. First, the WTO needed to recognise that small vulnerable states faced difficult challenges in making the necessary adjustment to multilateral trade liberalisation and achieving a sustainable threshold of development sufficient to free them from dependence on aid and trade preferences. Secondly, procedures for accession to the WTO needed to be streamlined and accelerated. Small states would find it easier to achieve membership if they were afforded financial and expert assistance in the process of accession, which was costly in terms of legal fees and also involved complex negotiations. Thirdly, the single most important development of the Uruguay Round was the creation of the strengthened dispute settlement mechanism. However, the legal costs of using this mechanism were substantial, clearly making it inaccessible for many small states. An arrangement should be established which would assist small states to make use of the mechanism. Finally, using the present formula of 0.03 per cent of world trade as a lower threshold for the membership subscriptions to WTO, meant that the per capita cost of membership was significantly higher for many small states than larger members of the Organisation. Given that small states, in aggregate, accounted for less than one-quarter of one per cent of world trade, there was a strong case for lowering their subscription fees.","WTCOMTDM26.pdf","Humphrey, Commonwealth, Secretariat, WTO, Commonwealth, Secretariat, World, Bank, WTO, WTO, Commonwealth, Secretariat, World, Bank, WTO, WTO, Uruguay, Round, WTO, Organisation"
"2163",2163,"15","15.       The Vulnerability Index took into account both the impact of vulnerability as well as the resilience of countries to adverse events. Thus there was a strong case for the WTO to take this into account in discussing trade issues. The first component of the index was based on three indicators: first, the lack of diversification; secondly, the extent of export dependence; and, thirdly, the impact of natural disasters. These were combined to form a composite index of the impact of vulnerability on developing countries. The resulting index was then weighted by GDP, as a proxy for resilience, the second component of the index. The index covered a sample of 111 developing countries, 37 small and 74 large, for which data were available. According to the index, small states were found to be systematically more vulnerable than large countries, regardless of income. The results indicated that of the 25 most vulnerable countries, 24 were small states and of the 50 most vulnerable countries                                                                                    WT/COMTD/M/26                                                                                            Page 5 33 were small states. It was interesting to note that many highly vulnerable countries were also least-developed; for example, half of the 50 most vulnerable countries fell into the least-developed country category.","WTCOMTDM26.pdf","WTO"
"2162",2162,"14","14.      The World Bank hosted a conference in St Lucia in February 1999 that was attended by about 125 people, including Prime Ministers and senior ministers as well as a wide cross-section from 25 countries. The main conclusions of the Conference were first, that there was a broad consensus emerged on the need for multilateral lending policies to be adjusted to meet the special needs of small states. Second, on trade issues, small states needed to take advantage of opportunities created by globalisation. But to do so, small states faced high transitional costs in integrating their economies into the global trading system which would require adequate resources. It was necessary for multilateral organisations responsible for the international trade regime to recognise and accommodate the acute vulnerability of many small states which did not fall into the least-developed category. Third, the volatility of lending by international financial institutions to small states was acute and more stable programmes of lending designed to overcome this were needed. Fourth, for small states knowledge and access to it were essential for promoting development. Taking advantage of new technologies in the field of communications, as well as other infrastructure could best be promoted by a regional approach. Fifth, financing mechanisms based on international capital markets were identified for disaster insurance, for elaboration and implementation on a sub-regional basis. Finally, the Commonwealth’s Vulnerability Index provided an operational tool for advancing the case for the special treatment of small and vulnerable states.","WTCOMTDM26.pdf","World, Bank, St, Lucia"

It also set out to develop proposals for international action by institutions such as the Bretton Woods organizations, the WTO, the Commonwealth and the EC. Its policy recommendations were preceded by an in-depth analysis of the needs of small states such as: the graduation policies of international financial institutions; strategies for coping with natural disasters; globalisation and the risk of marginalisation of small states; the problems of transition of small economies from a preferential trading system to a more liberal international trading environment; and vulnerability and the development of a vulnerability index to be used as an additional criterion in determining development assistance to small states.","WTCOMTDM26.pdf","WTO, EC"

He said that it was appropriate to present an updated version, on account of the third Ministerial Conference, but also because it would be possible to assess the impact of the financial crisis on developing countries. He recalled that WT/COMTD/W/31 covered the period 1991-96. It would be useful if the updated document examined three period of time: first, the very long run from the foundation of the WTO to the present; second the medium term, that is the 1990s as whole; and finally the period surrounding the financial crisis, that is 1996 to 1998/1999. The outline for the paper envisaged five sections. First, a section on long run trends which would largely be structured along the lines of the corresponding section of the Background Paper prepared for the High Level Symposium. Second, a section on data for the 1990's, which could include data on trade by region and product structure, as well as data on south-south trade. A third section would provide a factual account of developments in trade policies and practices in developing and transition economies since the start of the Uruguay Round trade negotiations, using data from Trade Policy reviews and other sources. The fourth section would address the recent financial crisis and its impact on trade, by assessing changes in trade patterns in the period 1997-98 as compared with the period preceding the crisis. This section could examine the trade of developing countries with countries affected by the crisis, and changes in the regional and product structure of trade. The last section would address the participation of least-developed countries in international trade, and provide updated information on the share of least-developed countries in world trade. Measure and initiatives taken at or since the High Level Meeting on Least-Developed Countries could also be examined.","WTCOMTDM26.pdf","Tulloch, Egypt, WTO, Uruguay, Round"

He agreed that the chapeau of paragraph 4 was perhaps misleading, as the contribution of the CTD would be to the preparatory process, or for the direct use of delegations, but not directly to the Ministerial Conference.","WTCOMTDM26.pdf","Egypt, Brazil, Secretariat, CTD, Members, CTD"
"2149",2149,"121","121.     The representative of the United States said that one detected from the statements made by Brazil, Pakistan and Uruguay, a logical train of thought regarding the role of the CTD in terms of preparations for the Ministerial Conference. There was a certain inevitability in tasking the CTD to undertake certain types of work, on the basis of items that had been tabled in the General Council, aside from the CTD's own mandate. He noted that it had also been pointed out that such work should be undertaken on the basis of an initiative of a Member in the General Council, to ensure the fulfilment of the General Council's role at all times as established by the Geneva Ministerial Declaration. This was the right way of proceeding, especially in light of the resource constraints that affected developing countries. He said that the Secretariat Note, Job No.3578, was somewhat ambiguous as to the role of the General Council, adding that it was somewhat presumptuous in paragraph 4 in referring to the input of the CTD to the Seattle Ministerial Conference, and that it                                                                                    WT/COMTD/M/26                                                                                           Page 27 would perhaps be necessary to reword this statement while a decision was awaited from the General Council.","WTCOMTDM26.pdf","United, States, Brazil, Pakistan, Uruguay, CTD, CTD, General, Council, CTD, Member, General, Council, General, Council, Secretariat, General, Council, CTD, Seattle, Ministerial, Conference, General, Council"

The mission, held in July 1998, was led by the Prime Minister of Barbados, and included the Deputy Prime Ministers of Lesotho and Mauritius and the Foreign and Trade Ministers of Fiji and New Zealand. During these discussions, the idea of establishing the Task Force was formalised with the World Bank. The WTO, IMF, UNCTAD and the European Commission all agreed to participate in this endeavour.

The CTD could however focus on work under its mandate, and report to the ordinary General Council. In doing so it could signal that the work undertaken was useful background material to the Ministerial Conference, and the General Council could then come to a decision as to whether the work done by the CTD was relevant to the preparatory process.

"2143",2143,"116","116.     The representative of Brazil said that it was recognised that the CTD was a special and peculiar body within the structure of the WTO, since its work was, by necessity, of a cross-cutting and horizontal nature, and because it addressed one of the pillars of the organisation, namely the question of development. There were several ways in which work could be conducted within the CTD so as to have an impact on the preparations of the Ministerial, in addition to preparing Members. One way was for Members to use the work of the CTD to develop and present proposals to the General Council, either as individual Members or as clusters of Members. A second way was for a Member to propose that the General Council mandate the CTD to conduct work which would serve as an input to the preparatory process. He recalled that one of the terms of reference of the CTD was to ""review periodically (…) the application of special provisions in the Multilateral Trade Agreements and related Ministerial Decisions in favour of developing country Members, and in particular least- developed country Members, and report to the General Council for appropriate action."". The CTD was thus mandated to consider any question that arose in the application of special and differential provisions. He said that there had been a number of proposals made in the General Council regarding special and differential treatment, but none of these had been discussed, for several reasons. The CTD, however, had the time and the mandate to consider such proposals, and developmental concerns in general, and suggested in this respect that an emphasis could be placed on implementation issues and the built-in agenda. Above all, the focus of the work conducted by the CTD should have as its focus the mainstreaming of development into the WTO. He suggested that on possibility was for the Secretariat to developing a work programme leading to the Ministerial Conference that focussed on analysing and debating the proposals submitted to the General Council which had a bearing on special and differential treatment. Second, it was necessary to examine how best to reflect the work of the CTD in the General Council, and he reiterated his delegation's concerns that the preparatory process would be fragmented if a number of subsidiary bodies made contributions on their own initiative. One possibility would be for the secretariat to prepare a paper based on a compilation of proposals made and discussion held. He acknowledged the concern expressed by the European Communities that the CTD avoid engagement in political debate, and sad that any paper prepared by the Secretariat need be purely factual and not analytical.

Brazil had two objectives: first to ensure that the imbalances of the Uruguay Round were corrected, and second, to avoid a situation in which any new rights and obligations failed to take into account the development concerns of Members. He said that the CTD had an important role to play and that the contribution of the CTD needed to be effective and directed towards the negotiating process. He said developing countries had difficulty in identifying and protecting their interests. It was necessary to be realistic about the ability of developing countries to engage fully and properly in negotiations, and that care was needed to ensure that developing countries were not left behind in the preparatory process owing to their shortfalls in capacity, and a fragmentation of the preparatory process. He quoted from the Geneva Ministerial Declaration which stated that ""a process (…) be established under the direction of the General Council to ensure full and faithful implementation of existing agreements and to prepare for the Third Session of the Ministerial Conference"". He noted that in a number of subsidiary bodies, there were efforts to speed up the preparatory process, which, though they could be understood, carried the danger that developing country interests would not be reflected at the third Ministerial Conference.","WTCOMTDM26.pdf","Brazil, Uruguay, Round, Members, CTD, CTD, General, Council"

He said that several Members envisaged that the third Ministerial Council would create new rights and obligations for Members and added that Brazil did not necessarily wish to dissociate itself with this view. He said that on the basis of the experience of implementation of Uruguay Round Agreements and of the special and differential provisions contained therein, the expectation of Brazil had been frustrated in                                                                                      WT/COMTD/M/26                                                                                             Page 25 several areas. He said that in the first instance, those special and differential provisions which were of a temporary nature, and which were due to expire, had proved to be insufficient to address the structural problems of developing countries. Furthermore, a number of special and differential provisions were limited to best endeavour clauses, which were often not observed. There was also the question of the interpretation of special and differential provisions in the context of dispute settlement procedures. Very often, such provisions were considered to be exceptions to the rules, and the burden of proof often fell on developing countries to justify recourse to such provisions. All these deficiencies needed to be addressed.","WTCOMTDM26.pdf","Brazil, CTD, General, Council, Members, Ministerial, Council, Members, Brazil, Uruguay, Brazil"

He said that information on special and differential provisions contained in subsidiary bodies had highlighted issued similar to those raised in the General Council, with the exception of the Agreement on Agriculture, regarding which he shared the surprise expressed by the delegation of Uruguay that no statement had been made.. Mr. Tulloch requested that Members provide their views on whether the CTD should conduct some work regarding the proposals submitted to the General Council as a supplement to the work it had already initiated on the implementation difficulties of provisions for special and differential treatment.

The representative of the European Communities said that the mandate given to the secretariat was to examine the work conducted by subsidiary bodies, and expressed the unease of his delegation regarding the suggestion that proposals submitted to the General Council be examined. He said that such an examination would be carried out in any case elsewhere, and that the exercise conducted by the CTD was of a factual nature, and should therefore avoid entering into the more political debate that occurred in the General Council.","WTCOMTDM26.pdf","European, Communities, General, Council, CTD, General, Council"

The representative of Uruguay said his delegation regretted that his delegation had not had time to study the document in detail, and added that the document would be forwarded to his capital, and that his delegation would provide further comments at a later date. Referring to page 13 of the document and the section on agriculture, he said that while there may not have been any statement WT/COMTD/M/26 Page 24 made in the Committee on Agriculture regarding special and differential treatment, one submission at least had been made - by Australia - to the General Council as part of the preparatory process. The delegation of Uruguay supported this proposal, along with other Members belonging to the Cairns Group of countries. He wished to know whether only information available in subsidiary bodies was going to be taken into account, or whether the number of proposals submitted to the General Council would also be considered.","WTCOMTDM26.pdf","Uruguay, Committee, on, Agriculture, Australia, General, Council, Uruguay, Members, Cairns, Group, General, Council"

He said that the broader the approach taken by the paper, the better, and that even if broad concerns were not related to specific special and differential provisions, the should still be included, perhaps in a different category. Regarding the section on responses to questionnaires, he said his delegation had never been optimistic about the level of responses to the questionnaires, since many developing country delegations were over-burdened with work owing to the preparatory process for the Ministerial Conference. The representative of Brazil said that the stage had been reached where the CTD could profit from discussions held in the General Council Special Sessions. During these a number of proposals had been tabled that covered agreements regarding which information was presented in the draft document, though no reference had been made to the proposals. This was not surprising as the material contained in the proposals presented tot he General Council was not available in specific committees. He said that committees such as the respective committees on anti- dumping, safeguards and subsidies had limited their work to operational and house-keeping exercises, without there being much debate or work of any analytical nature. His delegation did not believe that the Secretariat need limit the circulation of the document in order to take into account the proposals made to the General Council; such work could be done subsequently and separately.","WTCOMTDM26.pdf","Brazil, Brazil, CTD, General, Council, Special, Sessions, General, Council, Secretariat, General, Council"
"2132",2132,"106","106.     Mr. Tulloch apologised for the late circulation of the draft document, and said he hoped that Members had some initial comments to make. He recalled that it had been agreed in the CTD that the Secretariat would do two things. First, it was to compile and analyse answers to questionnaires circulated to Members concerning difficulties, if any, in the implementation of provisions for special and differential treatment. Second, it was to analyse information already available in the Secretariat. He said that the draft document was the first result of the Secretariat's efforts, and said that the note had two parts. The first presented the information provided by the six Members that had responded to the questionnaire circulated in November 1998. It had not been possible to conduct any meaningful analysis, given the low level of replies. The second part compiled information available in the various WTO bodies that were responsible for the administration of the different WTO Agreements. The section included statements made by members in the Trade Policies Review Body, the review process of the Dispute Settlement Understanding, and in the different councils and committees of the WTO. As requested by members the Note focused on the statements made concerning the implementation of special and differential provisions, rather than broader implementation concerns. Where statements on special and differential provisions were tied in with broader concerns regarding implementation, these concerns were presented under the heading ""General Comments"" at the start of each section. He said that the document as a whole provided a picture of the genuine concerns that Members had regarding the implementation of special and differential provisions. He reiterated that the document was being circulated in draft form, with a view to completing it in the light of comments made in the committee.","WTCOMTDM26.pdf","Tulloch, Members, CTD, Secretariat, Members, Secretariat, Secretariat, Members, WTO, WTO, WTO, Members"
"2131",2131,"105","105.     The Chairperson recalled that by decision of the CTD at its 22nd Session on 2 November 1998, the Secretariat was requested to prepare a Background Note compiling information on the difficulties, if any, that members may have experienced either in the implementation of these                                                                                     WT/COMTD/M/26                                                                                            Page 23 provisions and/or in making use of these provisions. The Secretariat had circulated a questionnaire on 12 November to members in order to collect the information required for the preparation of the document. As of the 25th Session of the CTD on 4 June, a mere five delegations had provided responses to the questionnaire, a number which subsequently rose to six when the delegation of Australia submitted its response. The Secretariat had also been making use of information available within the Secretariat. She informed the CTD that, as indicated at a previous informal meeting, the Secretariat had put together a first draft document based on the information supplied by delegations and collected form Secretariat sources. It had been circulated as a draft document (initially in English only). The Chairperson invited Mr. Tulloch, Director, Development Division, to present the draft report.","WTCOMTDM26.pdf","Chairperson, CTD, Secretariat, Secretariat, CTD, Australia, Secretariat, Secretariat, CTD, Secretariat, Secretariat, Chairperson, Tulloch, Director, Development, Division"

The Chairperson said that the discussion that had been held reflected the importance attached to technical assistance, and requested the Secretariat to take note of all proposals that had been made so that some of them might be implemented, citing the proposal made by the delegation of Senegal regarding the holding of a day of reflection on technical assistance as one particularly worthy of attention. She said that following the discussion held in the 25th Session of the CTD, she had addressed a letter to the Chairperson of the Budget Committee, and that both committees were liasing with each other in order to set a convenient date on which to hold an extraordinary session devoted to the financial crisis affecting technical assistance. The Chairperson said that she would address a second letter to the chairperson of the Budget Committee, informing her of the discussion held at this meeting. The Chairperson said that she also envisaged holding discussions with the Chairman of the General Council.

Regarding the question of outsourcing, he said that the point his delegation had wished to make was that in the experience of Namibia, the outsourcing of technical assistance activities had usually not been productive in terms of the delivery of effective technical assistance. He added that the difficulties faced in delivering technical assistance needed to be addressed in a systemic way.","WTCOMTDM26.pdf","Namibia, Namibia"

She said that New Zealand, as a developed Member and a donor, had gained much from the contributions it had made towards technical assistance projects, especially from those that had targeted to countries in the Asia-Pacific region. She echoed the point made by Switzerland that there was consensus as to the nature of the problem faced, and that it was necessary to seek solutions. She said that the proposal by Senegal to hold a day of reflection on technical assistance was a useful first step, and she encouraged the Secretariat to examine whether this could be taken up in the near future.

The representative of Senegal said that Brazil had made a number of relevant points, but that these concerned modalities and procedure, whereas it was important in the immediate to secure agreement the principle of funding technical assistance through the regular budget. He noted that many Members shared the point of view of his delegation that technical assistance was not getting the financial support that it was rightfully due. This was contrary to the commitments made by Members and to the principle of solidarity between Members. He recalled that technical assistance was beneficial to developing countries, but also developed country members, since the latter would benefit from the development of their trading partners. He clarified that his delegation did not seek to organise a one-off seminar on technical assistance, but rather to hold on an annual basis a day of reflection on all aspects of technical assistance. He thanked Canada for its support in this respect.","WTCOMTDM26.pdf","Senegal, Brazil, Members, Members, Members, Canada"

He said that the increased financing of assistance through the regular budget would entail increased contribution by all Members. He recalled that a number of developing countries already were in arrears in regard to the payment of their contribution to the WTO, and that the Budget Committee had been engaged in work relating to the threshold for minimum contributions to the WTO in order to lessen the burden on developing countries. He agreed with Japan that forthcoming trade negotiations would place additional burdens on the human resources of the Secretariat, as well as on developing country delegations. He said that as a number of new trade issues were not asked for by developing, but rather developed, members, developing Members should not be asked to share equally in the cost of providing technical assistance. He said that there was a differentiated responsibility between groups of Members regarding the provision of technical assistance. Regarding solutions to the funding crisis, he said that it followed from what he had just said that his delegation would have reservations regarding the proposal to fund technical assistance entirely through the budget. Alternatives which attracted the sympathy of his delegation were the possibility of voluntary contributions from donors, or increased cooperation with other organisations.

"2125",2125,"10","10.       Mr. Burki said that the World Bank focussed, in the paper, on the changing role of official aid flows, and what the World Bank could do to help small states in this context. He identified ten issues that were of interest to the World Bank, which were discussed in the paper, and which informed the World Bank's approach to the problems faced by small states. First, experience had indicated that good policies, when combined aid, led to a higher rate of economic growth, by as much as two percentage points according to empirical evidence. Second, improved aid flows enhanced the credit-worthiness of small states. This was an exceptionally important point, as the increasing importance of private capital flows increased the importance of credit worthiness. Third, international institutions, and particularly development banks, should take into account not only GDP but also the volatility and vulnerability of income in determining graduation thresholds and other policies. The World Bank urged international institutions to make use of the Vulnerability Index devised by the Commonwealth Secretariat, in order to formulate judgements about appropriate thresholds. Fourth, it was appropriate for the World Bank and other multilateral development banks to focus on the quality of the entire public expenditure programme, and not only on specific projects in order to derive the maximum benefit from aid flows. Fifth, it was the view of the World Bank that, given the low absorptive capacity of small states, better coordination would minimise demands placed by the donor community on the administrations of small states; this coordination could take place within a framework that identified the needs of small states and took account of the comparative advantages of the various institutions working to help small states improve their development prospects. Sixth, the World Bank had had good experiences with private executing agencies in the execution of projects financed by foreign assistance, particularly in countries where official institutions could not meet the demands placed on them by foreign aid agencies. Seventh, the World Bank had emphasised the need to promote regional institutions within which small states could work in order to realise economies of scale. There was good empirical evidence to indicate that where regional institutions had been effectively set up, these had improved performances in terms of aid utilisation. Eighth, it was the intention of the World Bank to use a proportion of the assistance it provided in order to reduce risk and vulnerability. This would involve a number of new innovations which had been undertaken as a result of the setting up of the Joint Task Force. Ninth, in at least one operation, the World Bank had provided contingent lines of financial assistance which could be tapped by small states in the event of natural disasters. Tenth, it was necessary for small states to restructure their economies. In order to do so, significant investment was needed in the development of human resources. It was necessary for the donor community to refocus its aid and technical assistance programmes towards the improvement of human resources.","WTCOMTDM26.pdf","Burki, World, Bank, World, Bank, World, Bank, World, Bank, World, Bank, Commonwealth, Secretariat, World, Bank, World, Bank, World, Bank, World, Bank, World, Bank, Joint, Task, Force, World, Bank"

Mr. Vijay said he would describe the programme content of JITAP and explain how the clusters that reflected that content had been set up to realise the three objectives of the programmes, namely building knowledge of the multilateral trading system; conforming to the multilateral trading system; and enhancing the readiness of the country's exporters to take advantage of opportunities offered by a liberalised economy. As explained earlier the technical work undertaken by the three organisations during the programming phase led to the identification of a number of activities that needed to be undertaken to realise the three objectives of the programme. During the programming phase, it was found that to optimise the use of resources and to derive synergy and economies of scale benefits, the activities were best undertaken in groups. This led to the adoption of a cluster approach. Groups of generic activities were called clusters. These generic activities or clusters were undertaken                                                                                    WT/COMTD/M/25                                                                                           Page 25 to satisfy the identified needs of each country. In each cluster, there were sufficient commonalities across the countries to allow for simultaneous delivery of a number of outputs in a group of countries. By using this approach, it was possible to undertake scores of activities involving over 1,000 implementation actions in eight countries through 15 clusters. The 15 clusters were best understood in terms of four families and could be classified as follows: knowledge of the MTS and its implications; reforms to meet MTS obligations; enterprise readiness; and support.","WTCOMTDM25.pdf","Vijay, MTS, MTS"
"2118",2118,"98","98.     Mr. Dagata said that coordination at the national level was through a steering group of involved institutions, donors and the three Geneva organisations. A senior official in the trade ministry was the focal point. Financial contributions for JITAP were brought together in a Common Trust Fund (CTF) administered by the ITC. Window One received unearmarked contributions, and Window Two for country-earmarked contributions. The total cost of the programme in the eight countries was estimated at US$10 million. Contributions to date were well over US$8 million; the funding gap was mainly in Kenya, and to a lesser extent in Côte d'Ivoire. There was a broad donor base, with 13 donors, including Côte d'Ivoire itself which had pledged to make a substantial contribution to the CTF for its own activities.","WTCOMTDM25.pdf","Dagata, Geneva, ITC, Kenya, CTF"
"2117",2117,"97","97.       Mr. Dagata said that needs identified during country assessments fell under four headings: first, the need to understand the implications of the new multilateral trading system for Africa's trade; second, the need for help in implementing WTO membership obligations and other undertakings; third, help in identifying new trade opportunities and potential problems for enterprises. And finally, a need to help exporters and importers respond to those opportunities and concerns. JITAP was first and foremost a capacity-building programme. Its distinctive features were joint participation of the three Geneva organisations; a single, or generic, programme with selected activities to address critical common needs, based on individual country needs and responses; organisation of scores of implementation actions in clusters of programme elements, with each cluster covering all partner countries, allowing for the simultaneous implementation across all eight countries, cluster-by-cluster; and finally a communication and discussion facility to facilitate networking among partner countries and between them and the Geneva organisations. This system, once in place, would greatly facilitate implementation and should easily be extended to other organisations. The distinctive features of JITAP contributed to enhancing synergies among partner countries and the Geneva organisations, as well as among programme activities; the use of resources through economies of scale in management and programme implementation; sustainability through networking and other capacity-building features; and replicability of the JITAP programme in other countries if and when it were decided to expand the programme.","WTCOMTDM25.pdf","Dagata, Africa, WTO, Geneva, JITAP"
"2116",2116,"96","96.     Mr. Dagata said that JITAP was the joint WTO/UNCTAD/ITC Integrated Technical Assistance Programme in Selected Least Developed and Other African countries. He said his presentation would try to shed light on JITAP's origins; its programme concepts and elements; its management and implementation modalities; and its relationship to the Integrated Framework for Trade-related assistance to LDCs. JITAP was concerned with technical cooperation for trade development, aimed at enhancing the participation of African countries in the multilateral trading system. JITAP was broad in scope, covering upstream policy and downstream practical solutions to country needs. Yet it was limited to meeting the most critical needs for trade-related technical WT/COMTD/M/25 Page 24 assistance. It was country-based, with inter-country linkages. It depended on partnerships, among the three Geneva-based institutions, with and among eight African countries, and with 13 donor countries. The participating countries were Tunisia, Uganda, Kenya, Tanzania, Benin, Ghana, Côte d'Ivoire and Burkina Faso. Four of these countries were least-developed countries. Its rationale was to help African countries benefit from the Uruguay Round Agreements. On the occasion of UNCTAD IX, in 1996, the three agencies announced their intention to jointly respond to African needs with integrated activities in selected countries. By end-1997, teams of Geneva-based technical staff, working closely with African national officials, had carried out needs assessments and designed individual projects with the eight participant countries. It became clear that critical country-level needs were predominantly common and that the programme response in each of the countries was becoming a common set of activities. When the prospect of pooling donor resources became evident and the benefits of simultaneous implementation were considered, individual country projects were transformed into the JITAP programme. Implementation had begun in 1998.","WTCOMTDM25.pdf","Dagata, WTO/UNCTAD/ITC, Integrated, Technical, Assistance, Programme, JITAP, Tunisia, Uganda, Kenya, Tanzania, Benin, Ghana, Burkina, Faso, Uruguay, UNCTAD"

Examples of this were the Joint Integrated Technical Assistance Programme for Selected Least-Developed and Other African Countries (JITAP); and activities undertaken by the WTO in the least-developed countries under the umbrella of the Integrated Framework for Trade-Related Technical Assistance to Least-Developed Countries, outcome of the High Level Meeting for Least-Developed Countries which was held in October 1997. She said that JITAP was a joint programme between ITC, UNCTAD and the WTO, while the Integrated Framework was a coordination mechanism which coordinates trade-related assistance activities in least-developed countries of six agencies: ITC, IMF, UNCTAD, UNDP, the World Bank and WTO. She was sure that while all delegations had heard about these two initiatives, it had seemed to her that there was a general interest among delegations to receive more information about them.

She recalled that the points contained in the compilation were neither negotiated nor reflected consensus. Taking into account all that had been said, she said she would endeavour to find a date that would be convenient for all in order to have further informal consultations, prior to the next CTD meeting scheduled for 7 July 1999. In the meantime, the Secretariat would take into account statements made during the meeting and revise the document accordingly. It was hoped that the this would be done in time for the informal consultations, which would be the last meeting during which there would be further discussion on the question, which would be the submitted to the CTD at its meeting of 7 July, during which a definite decision would have to be taken, if it was intended that the contribution of the CTD to the General Council be made by the end of July, as had been planned. She hoped that Members would be agreeable to this proposal, and said that in the meantime she would address a letter, in her capacity as chairperson of the CTD, to the chairman of the General Council, informing him that the question of                                                                                   WT/COMTD/M/25                                                                                          Page 23 electronic commerce continued to be discussed in the CTD.

The preliminary report had not yet been considered by the General Council, but would be on 15 June 1999. Therefore the compilation of points under discussion would form the basis for the definitive submission to the general Council for consideration by 31 July 1999. He said that there was therefore two months for the definitive report to be finalised by the CTD. If this was so, his delegation did not see why there should be a hurry to consider something as definitive when there were two months left at the disposal of the CTD.","WTCOMTDM25.pdf","Uruguay, General, Council, General, Council, CTD, CTD"

The representative of Japan said the point he had wished to make was that the point made in document WT/COMTD/W/18, paragraphs 130 and 131, regarding research undertaken by the WTO Secretariat on the impact of electronic commerce on customs revenue be included in the report on points made in the Seminar.","WTCOMTDM25.pdf","Japan, WTO, Secretariat"

He said he was deeply gratified to take on the position of chairman of the Sub-Committee, adding that there was a certain tradition amongst Nordic countries to look after the concerns of developing nations, and that he therefore looked forward to the task ahead.

"2107",2107,"88","88.      The representative of Venezuela supported the delegations of Brazil and Egypt in search of a more balanced text, adding that her delegation found it difficult to take on board paragraphs 3, 7, 23, and 24. In particular, she recalled that her delegation had stated a very definite position concerning public policy in investment matters. Her delegation wished to support the Uruguayan proposal to extract from the compilation all points made in the seminar. This did not negate the value of the seminar, and her delegation were willing to show flexibility in searching for a means to reflect the seminar. She believed that the opinions stated by some delegations, notably Egypt and Brazil, were of sufficient importance for there to flexibility regarding time-frames for the presentation of written comments. She suggested an informal approach be taken that would allow substantive modifications to the documents. she also asked whether the representative of Japan could repeat his proposal, which she had not fully understood.","WTCOMTDM25.pdf","Venezuela, Brazil, Egypt, Egypt, Brazil, Japan"
"2106",2106,"87","87.     Concerning objections made to the list of points made in the CTD, the representative of the United States said many delegations had raised the need for the list to reflect views not in agreement with the views already contained in the list. She said that objections to specific statements should be WT/COMTD/M/25 Page 22 included, though the statements should not be deleted, in recognition of the fact that the statements reflected views held by delegations. Regarding the points made by Mexico concerning technical assistance, she drew the attention of the CTD to the paper her delegation had circulated earlier, which contained a section on development, and which stated that, in addition to initiatives such as the ITA and basic telecommunication, the United States suggested that Members consider development assistance initiatives that fostered the growth of infrastructure, access to information technology and technical know-how. She therefore requested that the United States notation be included in the revision of the list. Regarding the comments made by India, she said that it was an Indian representative who had said during the Seminar that the question of the movement of natural persons may be minimal.","WTCOMTDM25.pdf","CTD, United, States, Mexico, CTD, ITA, United, States, Members, United, States, India"
"2105",2105,"86","86.      The representative of the United States thanked the Chairperson for her swift response. She said that her delegation agreed with comments made by Japan and Korea, that the list of points made in the seminar be retained in some shape or form, not necessarily as a submission to the General Council but perhaps as an annex. She agreed with Egypt that there were several items discussed in the seminar that would be useful for discussion in the CTD, recalling that the seminar had been initiated by the CTD, that there had been substantial input into the seminar from delegations, and that the representation at the seminar had been quite formidable. A broad spectrum of views had been expressed, and therefore she did not understand why the list of points made in the seminar should be treated as if it contained something repugnant. She recognised that there should be a distinction between statements made by Members and those made by individuals in the Seminar.","WTCOMTDM25.pdf","United, States, Chairperson, Japan, Korea, General, Council, Egypt, CTD, CTD, Members"
"2104",2104,"85","85.

"2103",2103,"84","84.      The representative of the European Commission said he shared the mild surprise expressed by the representative of Korea. about the debate that had been held. He said that informal discussions had been held, that his delegation had enquired from the Secretariat as to whether any written submissions had been made, and had been of the impression that the paper had been settled and could go forward. Unfortunately, this did not seem to be the case, and he said the question was how to ensure that there would be an input from CTD into the General Council process, adding that it was very important that there be such an input. He did not want to pronounce on how this should be done, the but necessary steps should be taken to have another discussion and another document, with sufficient time to discuss the document. His delegation were willing to discuss substantive points and did not want to prejudge any question which had been raised. It was important that there be a faithful reflection of what had been done in the committee. He expressed concern about the time frame for the completion of work and said his delegation were open to suggestions from the chair and the Secretariat on how to proceed.","WTCOMTDM25.pdf","European, Commission, Korea, Secretariat, CTD, General, Council, Secretariat"
"2102",2102,"83","83.     The representative of Canada said her delegation was of the view that there had been, within the CTD, very constructive discussions on electronic commerce and development, and that it was important to find a way of reflecting these in the report. Her delegation believed the compilation of points was useful and that provided the list could be revised to incorporate comments from the present Session and the informal consultations of 5 May, it would form an important part of the report. She said that if other delegations thought that these discussions could be reflected in a factual summary, her delegation were willing to show flexibility. Regarding points raised in the seminar, she said the reviews of the seminar had been good and that discussion in the seminar had been interesting, and that it was important that these points remained in the report. Her delegation were flexible as to whether points raised in the seminar should remain part of the list, prefaced by a ""chapeau"" explaining the context of that part of the report, or alternatively, that the points made in the seminar be turned into a separate document altogether. Finally, she said she believed Egypt had made a good point concerning the work of other organisations and the need for coordination, and that mention should be made of this in the report.","WTCOMTDM25.pdf","Canada, CTD, Egypt"
"2101",2101,"82","82.      Returning to the section on points made in the Seminar, the representative of Japan said it was a pity that no reference had been made to the work carried out by the WTO's Economic Research and Analysis Division on the impact of electronic commerce on customs tariff revenue, which had been refered to in paragraphs 130 and 131 of Secretariat document WT/COMTD/W/18. He said that the compilation should reproduce the contents of paragraph 131, which stated that ""the study estimated                                                                                      WT/COMTD/M/25                                                                                             Page 21 the customs tariff revenue loss in case all these goods were traded on-line to be US$200 million for developing countries and US$600 million. This amounted to less that 0.1 per cent of total world tariff revenues. The broad conclusion of the report was that for most countries, tariff losses from the on- line trade of digitised products were liable to be negligible"".","WTCOMTDM25.pdf","Japan, WTO, Economic, Research, and, Analysis, Division, Secretariat"
"2100",2100,"81","81.      The representative of Japan, commenting on the views expressed by Egypt and India, said that the holding of the seminar was useful in educating the CTD, and added that the proposal made to hold a seminar on special and differential treatment was a good one, to which his delegation had a positive attitude. However, the holding of a seminar without any concrete outcome was not very productive; some outcome was necessary, whether the seminar be on electronic commerce or special and differential treatment. He said that one possibility, regarding the seminar on electronic commerce, would be to separate the list of points made in the seminar and present it as an annex to the compilation, adding that it was useful to present a record of points made in the seminar to the General Council. He said his delegation could go along with the comments contained in the compilation, but that if some delegations did feel unsure about comments made, his delegation was willing to be flexible. Echoing the suggestion made by India, he said the compilation could be presented as a Chairperson's summary on her own responsibility, if there was no consensus within the CTD concerning the document.","WTCOMTDM25.pdf","Japan, Egypt, India, CTD, General, Council, India, Chairperson, CTD"
"2099",2099,"80","80.      The representative of India said that in his view the remarks made by Brazil, Egypt and others regarding the compilation of points were devastating. He identified two types of problems. First, errors of omission, inasmuch as when one view was expressed, the opposing view was not. He said there might be some reason for this, insofar as the inclusion of diametrically opposite views would leave the reader in doubt as to what the view held by the CTD was. He said the truth of the matter may be that the CTD had no view on the matter since it was an evolving and new area. Second, his delegation were also concerned about errors of commission. He refered to paragraph 8 and 9 which dealt with the movement of natural persons, and said that the statement that electronic commerce would make moot the issue of the movement of natural persons had no basis in reality. He cited as an example the high demand for Indian software specialists in the United States and Europe, in connection with the Y2K problem, and the fact that this demand could not be met owing to travel restrictions. It seemed, therefore, that contrary to the statement made in paragraph 9, electronic commerce accentuated the question of the movement of natural persons. It was therefore obvious that the report in its present form was problematic. Possible solutions included a summary by the Chairperson on her own responsibility, or a factual summary.","WTCOMTDM25.pdf","India, Brazil, Egypt, CTD, CTD, United, States, Europe, Chairperson"

It was so agreed.","WTCOMTDM25.pdf","Chairperson, Committee, on, Trade, and, Development, Ambassador, Benedikt, Jonsson, Chairman"
"2097",2097,"79","79.     The representative of Argentina said his delegation's views were along the lines of those expressed by Panama, Brazil, Egypt, Mexico and Uruguay. Regarding paragraph 16, he recalled that his country was not a party to the ITA, and said that his delegation was not of the view that the ITA, and specific commitments under the GATS, could facilitate the access to IT goods and services. His delegation supported the view expressed by Brazil saying that a factual report was needed reflecting the various comments made in the CTD, and supported keeping separate from the document the main points made in the seminar.","WTCOMTDM25.pdf","Argentina, Panama, Brazil, Egypt, Mexico, Uruguay, ITA, ITA, Brazil, CTD"
"2096",2096,"78","78.     The representative of Korea said his delegation was surprised that the discussion that had taken place was similar to the discussion held in the informal consultations. He said it was important to send a summary that fully reflected points made in the CTD. Given that the CTD had to send a report to the General Council by 30 July, his delegation proposed that a final deadline for written submissions. He said that it was important to include in the submission the points made in the Seminar, since the holding of the seminar was decided by the CTD, and because participants at the seminar were similar to the participants in the CTD. Given the technical nature of electronic commerce, his delegation did not consider the points made in the seminar to be less relevant than points made in the CTD.","WTCOMTDM25.pdf","Korea, CTD, CTD, General, Council, CTD, CTD, CTD"
"2095",2095,"77","77.       The representative of Mexico agreed with Brazil that the Agreement on Government Procurement was not a multilateral agreement, and that this would have to be specified in the text, or reference to it removed altogether. He said that the point made by Egypt regarding investment in infrastructure was most important. Mention needed to be made of public investment, in order to bring greater balance to the text. Regarding the illustrative list of questions, he said that mention should be made of the main aspects of development to be addressed in terms of electronic commerce. Regarding paragraph 18, he agreed that greater cooperation between the institutions listed was necessary, adding that greater coordination amongst the institutions was necessary as well, especially in connection with technical assistance. He cited as an example the possibility of cooperation between the WTO and the UNCTAD, given the work undertaken by the latter, especially in connection with human resources. Regarding paragraph 27, he asked what it meant in practice to enhance the role of small and medium enterprises in electronic commerce, and suggested that this would involve technical assistance programmes in connection with UNCTAD. The WTO should examine the experiences of UNCTAD in this field to stimulate greater participation of SMEs in electronic commerce. He noted that there was no specific reference to technical assistance in the illustrative list of questions, and said that technical assistance was important if developing country access to infrastructure was to be improved, and their empowerment in the domain of electronic commerce realised. Finally, he said that the document submitted by the CTD to the General Council should list only comments made in the CTD. He said that it was not relevant to refer to the Seminar, and indeed that any relevant points made in the Seminar had been made before the CTD. Such points included the high price of access to the Internet, the predominance of English, the chain of confidence, the issue of human resources. He agreed with the statements made by Brazil, and said that the format in which the statements were presented should indicate that the statements did not reflect agreed positions.

"2094",2094,"76","76.      The representative of Egypt said his delegation associated itself with the statement made by Brazil, adding that his delegation shared the views expressed by Brazil, Uruguay and Panama. He said that the paper was useful as a compilation, but that its utility was limited to that. The paper should be an evolving document which included the statements, remarks and concerns of different delegations. In addition to the points the representative of Brazil had cited as examples where the balance of views needed to be more adequately reflected, the representative of Egypt drew the attention of the CTD to the following points. Regarding paragraph 4, he considered the use of the word ""phenomenon"" in connection with electronic commerce to be strange, though he agreed that electronic commerce was here to stay. The main issue was to ensure that developing countries could participate effectively in electronic commerce. It was important to identify different concerns and conditions to allow this. Regarding paragraph 5, he shared the view that electronic commerce had positive effects on growth and development, but was concerned that if developing countries were not able to participate in electronic commerce in an effective manner, this could affect their participation in international trade. Regarding the question of movement of natural persons addressed in paragraphs 8 and 9, his delegation were of the view that electronic commerce should not be used as an excuse to avoid further liberalisation in the area of movement of natural persons, or as a substitute for such liberalisation. Regarding paragraph 12, his delegation believed that there were various aspects to infrastructure investment, and that this was not limited to the private sector. The use of public funds, development assistance requirements, and other elements, should not be ignored. Regarding the section on constraints faced by developing countries, it was important to refer to some of the innovative ways in which developing countries have addressed these constraints. Regarding paragraph 17, he said that the role of government need not be minimal, pointing to the issue of taxation as one where the government had an important role. He added that one often spoke of the right macroeconomic framework, but not necessarily about hospitable policy environments, and that there was a need to refine some of the aspects refered to in this regard, and a need for more precise language. Regarding paragraph 19, he said reference needed to be made to the role of the ITC and UNCTAD. Regarding paragraph 23, he said his delegation participated in the working group on trade and investment, and that the determinants of foreign investment and where foreign investment goes are more complex than reflected by the paragraph. His delegation believed this paragraph was one where more balance could be introduced, along with details regarding various aspects of the determinants of foreign investment. Regarding paragraph 24, his delegation shared the views expressed by Brazil that low or zero duty access, was not the only solution to the questions addressed in paragraph 24. The questions raised in the illustrative list were important and pertinent, and that the                                                                                     WT/COMTD/M/25                                                                                            Page 19 Secretariat should complement the paper prepared earlier on electronic commerce with an analytical paper that would attempt to respond to some of the questions. He noted that, in particular, questions 34 to 39 and 41 to 43, were important questions that could form the basis of a future paper by the Secretariat. Regarding paragraph 31, he said that the issues of infrastructure and technical assistance should be separated. Regarding paragraph 33, he said that reference to ""unrestricted, unregulated electronic commerce"" was too sweeping, since some elements of electronic commerce had implications which affected health, safety and other matters where regulations and restrictions were important. Finally, regarding the seminar, he acknowledged the view expressed by Brazil that the points raised in the seminar should be contained in a separate document, and that his delegation was willing to go along with this proposal. His delegation were nevertheless of the view that the paper on points raised in the seminar should be much more substantial and much more detailed, since there were a number of points raised in the seminar which could be used as inputs for discussions in capitals and for further deliberations by the CTD. He cited the example of the Symposium on Trade Facilitation, following which a document containing papers submitted and statements made by participants was produced, as a possible model. In conclusion, his delegation wished to add another aspect to discussions regarding electronic commerce, in the belief that the issue of electronic commerce required a much more integrated approach was required by international organisations, especially those based in Geneva, along the lines used in connection with issues relating to LDCs. His delegation believed that important work was being conducted by UNCTAD on the development aspects of electronic commerce, and at the ITC regarding the role of the private sector and electronic commerce. The WTO was working on rules and the their implications for electronic commerce, WIPO was addressing various aspects of intellectual property rights in relation to electronic commerce, and ITU is addressing various issues in relation to telecommunications and infrastructure. The presence of all these organisations allowed them to play an important role in an integrated manner in order to ensure that activities are not duplicated, and that some coherence exists in addressing issues connected to electronic commerce. The participation of relevant non-Geneva based organisations, such as UNCITRAL, UNDP and the World Bank, could be investigated.","WTCOMTDM25.pdf","Egypt, Brazil, Brazil, Uruguay, Panama, Brazil, Egypt, CTD, ITC, UNCTAD, Brazil, Secretariat, Secretariat, Brazil, CTD, Trade, Facilitation, Geneva, UNCTAD, ITC, WTO, WIPO, ITU, UNCITRAL, UNDP, World, Bank"
"2093",2093,"75","75.       The representative of Brazil recalled that his delegation had expressed the view that the compilation of points was difficult to work with, and that it suffered from inadequacies in terms both of format and content. His delegation had been expecting major changes to the document, but these had not materialised. He recalled that his delegation, and several others, had requested that the points raised in the seminar be struck out. His delegation had agreed to the holding of the seminar on the understanding that this was a separate initiative with no linkage to the work of the CTD, and saw no utility in attaching the list of points raised in the seminar in this or any other document reporting to the General Council on the work programme on electronic commerce. Regarding the points raised in the CTD, he understood that while there was a disclaimer at the start of the document that the points compiled do not necessarily reflect agreed positions, his reading of the document led him to believe the compilation did not reflect views expressed. For instance, regarding paragraph 2, he said that while some delegations had indeed argued that stronger organic links and a more coordinated approach should be established among the areas of WTO competence, others had argued that this was premature. This view, however, was not reflected in the paper, and it was possible that an uninformed reader could gather the impression that there existed an emerging consensus on the points made in paragraph 2. In paragraph 3, it was stated that aspects of electronic commerce were relevant under a number of Agreements in the WTO, including the Agreement on Government Procurement and ITA-I and II. While some delegations had argued in that such agreements were of relevance, others had argued to the contrary. These views, however, were not reflected. Regarding paragraph 6, while some WT/COMTD/M/25 Page 18 delegations had indeed argued that the growth of electronic commerce raised important trade policy and trade facilitation issues, others had argued that trade facilitation had no bearing on the discussions of electronic commerce. Regarding paragraph 9, some delegations had argued that electronic commerce would make moot the question of the movement of natural persons, while others had argued to the contrary, but this was not reflected in the compilation. Regarding paragraph 23, which stated that investment in infrastructure will be encouraged through regimes that guarantee non-discriminatory treatment among investment, he said that there were no relevant WTO disciplines in this domain. Regarding paragraph 24, while some delegations had argued in favour of low or zero-duty access for computer and telecommunications equipment, others had argued that this was a question of national policy and that members had the right to determine access, but that this was not reflected in the compilation. The representative of Brazil said that he could make similar points in regard to all the paragraphs of the report. While he did not disagree with the content of the compilation of points, he said that different views had been expressed in the course of the CTD discussions, and that this balance was not reflected in the compilation of points. It was therefore difficult to use the compilation of points, as it stood, as a basis for a report to the General Council. Given that there was a time constraint, he suggested that a factual report be prepared which would report that discussions had been held in the CTD, and simply state the main headings listed in the compilation of points. He added that he was also open to the Chairperson submitting a report, on her own responsibility, to the General Council.","WTCOMTDM25.pdf","Brazil, CTD, General, Council, CTD, WTO, WTO, WTO, Brazil, CTD, General, Council, CTD, Chairperson, General, Council"
"2092",2092,"74","74.     The representative of Uruguay drew the attention of the CTD to paragraph 19, and said that at the last informal meeting, his delegation had suggested inserting the phrase ""legal issues in UNCITRAL"", given that UNCITRAL was the organisation that had first dealt with these issues. Also in connection with paragraph 19, he said that Domain Names were the concern of WIPO and not ITU. Third, he questioned the inclusion of the section on points made in the seminar. Finally, he said that delegations were still awaiting the document mentioned in paragraph 43 of the Secretariat Paper WT/COMTD/W/51, regarding the economic implications of electronic commerce. He recalled that at the end of 1998, his delegation had requested the circulation and discussion of the document in the CTD, and that request had been reiterated in the meeting of 2 March 1999, with the support of the EC, India, Hong Kong, China; Cuba, and others. He said that since the document was mentioned in the Secretariat paper, delegations had the right to read it. He therefore reiterated the request he had made Finally, regarding the format of the report to the General Council, he wished to know whether the report would consist of a list of points or whether a more substantive report would be prepared.","WTCOMTDM25.pdf","Uruguay, CTD, UNCITRAL, UNCITRAL, WIPO, ITU, Secretariat, CTD, EC, India, Hong, Kong, China, Cuba, Secretariat, General, Council"
"2091",2091,"73","73.      The representative of Panama said the compilation was useful and could be used as a proper guide to future discussions on the matter of electronic commerce. He drew attention to paragraph 9 of the compilation which stated that ""the essential nature of electronic commerce and cyberspace would make moot the issue of Movement of Natural Persons"", and said that while this was true to some aspects of business transactions, notably processes which could be handled through electronic means, that these were only a limited part of the activities of the firm. It was possible that even though a firm                                                                                        WT/COMTD/M/25                                                                                               Page 17 conducted its work by electronic means, it could also have offices in a number of countries, which would require staff travel, thus ensuring that Movement of Natural Persons remained relevant. He said that the question of Movement of Natural Persons was also relevant to the point made in paragraph 13 of the compilation regarding the training of human resources, as this could require that an office transfer staff from one office to another for training purposes. Regarding paragraphs 15 and 16, he said that the policies and regulations adopted by developed countries affected the development of electronic commerce at the world level. He cited as examples certain export controls on technology, and certain prohibitions on information exports if certain confidentiality requirements are not met. Such policies could have a tremendous impact on the transfer of information and the conduct of business by electronic means across frontiers. Regarding paragraph 18, and the principle of avoiding duplication in the work conducted by international institutions, he said that that in the exercise of avoiding duplication of effort, care must be taken to devote sufficient resources to covering the existing needs of developing countries. Regarding paragraph 49, he noted that it was not simply access prices to the Internet that were an important obstacle, but also the initial costs of securing a presence that would provide access to the Internet highways. It would be useful to have an exchange of ideas regarding the various methods being developed to increase access to electronic networks. Finally, he noted that there were some further barriers to the development of electronic commerce, such as legal systems which established monopolies or closed markets, such as telecommunications or the ticketing systems of airline seats.","WTCOMTDM25.pdf","Panama, Movement, of, Natural, Persons, Movement, of, Natural, Persons"

The representative of the United States said her delegation were curious to know why the first item of the issues paper regarding points raised in the CTD contained a reference to Article XX.

The Chairperson recalled that at the informal consultations conducted on 5 May 1999, a final deadline of 25 May was set for submission by Members, who desired to do so, to the Secretariat of any further written contributions to the compilation of points. She said that since the informal consultations of 5 May 1999, no additional comments had been received from any Member. The compilation of points therefore, remained unchanged from when Members last discussed the paper on 5 May 1999. She remained convinced that the compilation of points provides a good basis for finalising the contribution of the CTD to the General Council in fulfilment of the Terms of Reference for the CTD on the WTO Work Programme on Electronic Commerce. She wished to have Members' comments on the compilation of points with a view to finalising the contribution and adopting it as the contribution of the CTD to the WTO Work Programme on Electronic Commerce.","WTCOMTDM25.pdf","Chairperson, Members, Secretariat, Member, Members, CTD, General, Council, CTD, WTO, Work, Programme, Members, CTD, WTO, Work, Programme"

"2086",2086,"69","69.     Dr. Cosgrove-Sacks said she agreed entirely that the core problem lay in fostering an electronic business culture in developing and transition economies, adding that this was an issue on which institutions concerned with capacity building should focus. The UN/ECE had a limited role in WT/COMTD/M/25 Page 16 capacity building, insofar as its essential focus lay in the promotion of standards and norms, and the promotion of best practices in electronic business and trade facilitation. The UN/ECE did work with other regional UN commissions, but left to UNCTAD, the ITC and other capacity-building organisations the bulk of the work in promoting an electronic business culture. Referring to the distinction drawn by the representative of Mexico between trade facilitation and electronic commerce, Dr. Cosgrove-Sacks said that there was clearly a difference between the two, and that the point she had made was that there was only a limited value in speeding up the process by which goods were ordered (by means of electronic commerce) if the delivery of products still took an inordinately long time to reach their destination on account of various barriers, notably non-tariff barriers. This was the reason why electronic commerce highlighted the urgency of facilitating trade flows, and explained why there was a fundamental link between the two concepts. Referring to the question raised by the representative of Panama about the work done by UN/ECE in facilitating the reengineering of business processes, Dr. Cosgrove-Sacks said that UN/CEFACT was working closely with the delivery mechanisms of technical assistance and capacity building to help developing countries and major enterprises to understand what needed to be done. At the same time, it was necessary for governments around the world to had to consider the implications of electronic commerce. She cited the example of Switzerland, where had government initiated a process in order to raise awareness of electronic commerce at all levels of business, to enable Switzerland to take a strategic advantage in electronic commerce. She also cited the government procurement services of the United States, which used United Nations rules for Electronic Data Interchange for Administration, Commerce and Transport procedures in their activities. She urged delegations to make contact with UN/CEFACT if they wished further information regarding assistance activities in trade facilitation.","WTCOMTDM25.pdf","Cosgrove-Sacks, UN/ECE, UN/ECE, UN, UNCTAD, ITC, Mexico, Cosgrove-Sacks, Panama, UN/ECE, Cosgrove-Sacks, Switzerland, Switzerland, United, States, United, Nations, Electronic, Data, Interchange, for, Administration, Commerce, and, Transport"
"2085",2085,"68","68.     The representative of Panama recalled that Dr. Cosgrove-Sacks had mentioned in the course of the presentation that one of the problems experienced in electronic business was that of reengineering business processes, and raised the question of whether there was any example of countries where businesses had reengineered their processes in order to implement the SAP industrial process. He wished also to know what UN/ECE were doing to facilitate the reengineering process in developing countries, especially in the light of difficulties experienced in developed countries in the execution of reengineering.","WTCOMTDM25.pdf","Panama, Cosgrove-Sacks, SAP"
"2084",2084,"67","67.       The representative of Mexico thanked Dr. Cosgrove-Sacks for her presentation. His first comment had to do with access, and specifically the fact that connection charges were high in developing countries. Small and medium enterprises (SMEs) preferred to acquire what was essential before embarking on electronic commerce. A fundamental need was to lower access costs in order to ensure that SMEs had access and therefore participate in international trade. A second point was that protection of content was unequal, in that developing countries were recipients of contents and not producers. For instance, countries like his which sought to produce catalogues reflecting their own culture and language were not able to do so. Third, there were questions of confidentiality and security in electronic business. Fourth, there was a lack of an ""electronic business culture"" or ethos, and the development of such a culture needed to be supported by international institutions. Fifth, he recalled Dr. Cosgrove-Sacks' statement that the future of electronic commerce would be dominated by business-to-business transactions, and said that a greater knowledge was needed of the view of firms on as to how such transactions took place. Finally, he noted that the presentation touched on the facilitation of trade, and pointed out that there was a clear distinction between electronic commerce and trade facilitation, and that it was quite mistaken to say that the two were one and the same thing.","WTCOMTDM25.pdf","Mexico, Cosgrove-Sacks, Cosgrove-Sacks"

"2082",2082,"65","65.     Dr. Cosgrove-Sacks said the United Nations strove to create an efficient environment for developing countries. UN/CEFACT was the major source of standards and recommendations for best practice relating to business process, and was at the core of producing ground rules for the digital market-place. UN/CEFACT worked to enhance the information infrastructure, had a memorandum of understanding with the International Standards Office and the International Electro-technical Commission (IEC), and were concerned to build capacity through the use of standards. It was through basic standards that UN/CEFACT provided the basic tools that enabled electronic commerce to work. UN/CEFACT also sought to build capacity by ensuring a real participation in international supply chains, and encouraged developing countries to ""learn by doing"". Finally UN/CEFACT advocated capacity building through technical assistance, and drew attention in this respect to the work of other regional UN agencies and UNCTAD.","WTCOMTDM25.pdf","Cosgrove-Sacks, United, Nations, International, Standards, Office, International, Electro-technical, Commission, IEC, UN, UNCTAD"
"2081",2081,"64","64.      As stated before, a central challenge was the integration of developing countries into the international supply chain. One possible positive step was to reduce the barriers that were put up by regulatory bodies. This was a prerequisite not only for the development of international trade, but also for the development of electronic commerce. This brought up, again, the importance of a commitment to trade facilitation, to ensure that such barriers to trade were reduced. Second, it was necessary to deal with delays and uncertainties in business processes, such as legal issues, in the context of an international framework for electronic business. All commercial enterprises needed to be concerned with the effectiveness of business process, by simplifying and streamlining their business processes. A greater focus on electronic commerce as a means to increase revenue and value added was also needed.","WTCOMTDM25.pdf",""
"2080",2080,"63","63.     Dr. Cosgrove-Sacks said the concept of electronic commerce could be structured either by type of business relations or by type of commercial activity, and presented a matrix that structured the type of relations between three categories of partners (individuals, business, and government) which sent or received data and information electronically.           The center of the matrix covered business-to-business and business-to-government communications, where the exchange of data by electronic means was of supreme importance. Business-to-business relationships had become, financially, the most important part of electronic commerce. All of these relationships depended on the provision of good communication links, and one of the challenges for developing countries lay in the inadequacy of their telecommunications infrastructure.

"2079",2079,"62","62.      Dr. Cosgrove-Sacks said that electronic commerce had had its principal impact in the software and services sectors since it was possible to deliver the product through the same channels as by which the product had been ordered. However, when trade in goods was considered, one had to be concerned with how one delivered the goods and how one ordered and traded goods. Electronic commerce was thus about the synergy formed by the use of digital information, computerised business practices and the Internet. Electronic commerce was defined by UN/CEFACT as doing business electronically, through, inter alia, the sharing of standardised unstructured or structured business information by electronic means, and the use of such tools as electronic mail or messaging, the World Wide Web, smart cards, electronic funds transfers, automated data capture and bar codes, and electronic data interchange. The importance of electronic commerce was due to the fact that it resided in the overlap between business processes, institutions, and networks. The deliberations of international organisations should accordingly focus on the overlap between these three areas.","WTCOMTDM25.pdf","Cosgrove-Sacks"
"2078",2078,"61","61.      Dr. Cosgrove–Sacks refered to the CTD note ""Development Implications of Electronic Commerce"" (WT/COMTD/W/51) and said that UN/CEFACT were convinced of the analysis contained therein, namely that the benefits of electronic commerce were only possible if it was possible to reduce the physical, economic, juridical and policy constraints in doing business internationally. It was necessary to look, in the first instance, at the benefits of electronic commerce and assess how to reduce the costs of international trade procedures, and thus to focus on the role of trade facilitation. In this context she said that UN/CEFACT were pleased that some Members had proposed that trade facilitation be included in a possible millennium round of talks. Second, it was necessary to reduce transaction costs by building an effective global supply chain, and to integrate developing and transition countries into this global supply chain. Third, the investment in human and physical infrastructure that enabled participation in this new way of doing business needed to be addressed.","WTCOMTDM25.pdf","Cosgrove, CTD, Members"
"2077",2077,"60","60.      Dr. Cosgrove–Sacks said that trade was part of an international supply chain, which ran from the initial trade enquiry to the delivery of the product. At various stages of the international supply chain, there took place activities which did not add any value, but which did cause costs to increase. Such activities were related to storing, handling, inspection, certification, and so forth. In all of these instances, there was tremendous potential for electronic commerce, and scope for improving the efficiency of the international supply chain. In the case of a food export supply chain, it was estimated that there were as many as 27 processes among 40 different parties, so that even a fairly rapid transaction took 12 weeks for completion. The question therefore was how to use the technologies and techniques of electronic commerce to reduce the length of the process, to generate more income and to enhance the participation of developing countries in international trade. It was necessary to examine the paradigm shift caused by electronic commerce in ways of doing business.","WTCOMTDM25.pdf","Cosgrove, Sacks"

According to Rule 12bis of the Rules of Procedure for Meetings of the CTD, the CTD was obliged to elect the Chairperson for the Sub-Committee on Least-Developed Countries from among the representatives of the Members at its first meeting of the year. She regretted that this had not been possible in the light of the consultations that had to be undertaken, which had been announced by her predecessor at the 24th Session of the CTD. These consultations had yielded truly excellent results. She was pleased to inform Members of the CTD that consultations had made evident a consensus in favour of H.E. Mr. Benedikt Jónsson, Ambassador of Iceland, to be the next Chairman of the Sub-Committee.

"2075",2075,"59","59.     She said that UN/ECE spanned North America and the whole European continent, an area that accounted for two-thirds of world trade. For over 30 years UN/ECE experts had been developing instruments such as standards and norms to facilitate international business. In order to be effective, WT/COMTD/M/25 Page 14 such standards and procedures needed to be global, which in turn required cooperation on a global scale. This realisation led to the establishment of the United Nations Centre for Facilitation of Procedures and Practices for Administration, Commerce and Transport (UN/CEFACT). While UN/CEFACT was based in the UN/ ECE, it had close and intensive links with the other United Nations regional economic commissions, and worked closely with the WTO.","WTCOMTDM25.pdf","UN/ECE, North, America, United, Nations, Centre, for, Facilitation, of, Procedures, and, Practices, for, Administration, Commerce, and, Transport, UN, /, ECE, United, Nations, WTO"
"2074",2074,"58","58.       Dr. Cosgrove-Sacks began by stating that the purpose of her presentation was to address some development implications of electronic commerce and examine how electronic business could be used by developing and transition countries to build capacity. She wished to address three key issues: first, the fact that electronic business consisted of international supply chains; second, the importance of trade facilitation to ensure smooth movement of goods across borders, so that the efficiency gains from electronic commerce were effectively realised; and third, the importance of capacity building to allow developing countries to participate in electronic commerce.","WTCOMTDM25.pdf","Cosgrove-Sacks"

The Chairperson recalled that at the 24th Session of the CTD on 2 March 1999, it had been decided that the CTD should invite the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (ECE) to this Session of the CTD to provide a presentation on electronic commerce. She welcomed Dr. Carol Cosgrove-Sacks, Director, Trade Division in the ECE, to the CTD and invited her to make her presentation.","WTCOMTDM25.pdf","Chairperson, CTD, CTD, United, Nations, Economic, Commission, for, Europe, ECE, CTD, Carol, Cosgrove-Sacks, Director, ECE, CTD"
"2072",2072,"56","56.     The Chairperson thanked the representative of Morocco for his statement, and recalled that there was a specific item on the Agenda regarding possible inputs into the 3rd Ministerial Conference.","WTCOMTDM25.pdf","Chairperson, Morocco"
"2071",2071,"55","55.      The representative of Morocco said he wished to draw a distinction of importance for the work of the CTD. He said that delegations needed to avoid confusing proposals made in the context of the preparatory process for the Ministerial Conference on one hand, with proposals relating to the substantive work of the CTD on the other. Thus when it was proposed that a seminar be held on the subject of special and differential treatment, one had to be clear in one's mind whether this was specifically in the context of the preparatory process for the Ministerial Conference or whether this concerned the substantive work of the CTD. This distinction needed to be kept in mind with respect to all items on the CTD's agenda. He emphasised that the CTD had a special responsibility in the context of the preparatory process for the Ministerial Conference, as had been the case in 1996, because questions related to development needed to be discussed within the CTD. As far as possible, information regarding the implementation of different agreements needed to be provided to the CTD that it may evaluate this information, and thus contribute to the application of paragraph 8 of the Geneva declaration. Whereas it was typically the role of the General Council to provide an overview of the organisation and its agreements, the CTD now had the possibility to provide such an overview and transmit it to the General Council. In order that this happen, the CTD should mandate the Chairperson to request from the Chairs of different committees information on the implementation of different agreements. Every effort should be made to ensure that developing and least developed countries have proposals for the Seattle Ministerial Conference. At the same time, a collective assessment was required from the CTD as an input into the Seattle Ministerial Conference.","WTCOMTDM25.pdf","Morocco, CTD, CTD, CTD, CTD, CTD, CTD, CTD, General, Council, CTD, General, Council, CTD, Chairperson, Seattle, Ministerial, Conference, CTD, Seattle, Ministerial, Conference"

He took note of the offer made by the representative of India to submit to the CTD a copy of the proposal it had submitted to the General Council. He took note of the Egyptian                                                                                     WT/COMTD/M/25                                                                                            Page 13 delegation's point about the paper it had submitted earlier to the CTD, and also of the request for a seminar.

The representative of Senegal concluded his statement by congratulating the eleven IGOs for their presence as observers on an ad hoc, meeting by meeting basis, and made specific mention of the two West African Organisations, namely ECOWAS and WAEMU. He said this demonstrated a constant desire of CTD members that developing countries participate actively in the work of the WTO. This was a signal that pointed to the role of developing countries at the Seattle Ministerial, and it was thus wholly legitimate that they concerned themselves with special and differential treatment. There was no doubt that when subjects like the GATS or the Agreement on Agriculture were broached, the subject of special and differential treatment would acquire much greater interest.","WTCOMTDM25.pdf","Senegal, ECOWAS, WAEMU, CTD, WTO, Seattle, Ministerial"

The representative of Senegal said that his delegation was undertaking an internal consultation at the level of the different committees responsible for different subjects within the WTO, and that his delegation would communicate its responses to the questionnaire as soon as possible. His delegation supported the proposal made by the delegation of Morocco concerning the holding of a seminar on special and differential treatment. This would respond to a concern frequently expressed by the G.15, and this context he wished to refer to work that had been carried out in New Delhi which had brought together India, Senegal, Egypt and Jamaica. Results from this work could feed into work undertaken in preparation for the seminar. His delegation welcomed with great interest the proposal put forward by the Secretariat to circulate an informal note. He recalled that the Secretariat had, following the completion of the Uruguay Round, prepared a document covering subjects of interest to developing countries. Given that special and differential treatment was one such subject, it was normal that after five years that one should examine the contents of the concept, as well as its scope and coverage; whether the concept had been operational; and improvements to be made in terms of rights available to developing countries and obligations for developed countries. Hence his delegation hoped that the proposed seminar could be held as soon as possible.","WTCOMTDM25.pdf","Senegal, WTO, Morocco, New, Delhi, India, Senegal, Egypt, Jamaica, Secretariat, Secretariat, Uruguay, Round"
"2066",2066,"50","50.      The representative of Brazil said that the point of the CTD was to help developing countries to prepare for the Ministerial Conference. If the Secretariat could help developing countries, well and good; if not, developing countries would be left where they were. Brazil, as a developing country, had limited resources. His delegation were not expecting from the Secretariat specific comments on specific provisions for special and differential treatment, with specific indications as to how to proceed. He did not believe that the problems faced by the Secretariat were due to lack of information and added that he sympathised with the Secretariat's position. He understood the comments made by the European Communities that the CTD should engage in a more specific debate than that which took place in the General Council. However, he did not believe that this was what delegations wanted. If all the Secretariat could provide was a paper with general comments on the implementation of special and differential provisions, that had to be accepted as what was feasible. If the paper could go further, it may then go further. What was unacceptable was that there be no document at all. He said the first phase was of the preparatory process was over, and the second phase was mid-way to completion, following which delegations would be involved in a negotiating and drafting phase, at which point if the paper was not ready it may as well be forgotten. He therefore agreed that the Director of the Development Division should circulate what was available, adding that it was necessary to be realistic about the matter.","WTCOMTDM25.pdf","Brazil, CTD, Secretariat, Brazil, Secretariat, Secretariat, Secretariat, CTD, General, Council, Secretariat, Director"

"2064",2064,"49","49.      The representative of India said that a critical phase had been reached, at which developing countries were trying to change the face of the organisation. There was active participation, as there had been in the Uruguay Round, and there would be much more active participation at the Seattle Ministerial Conference. With this was likely to come pressure for change. He said that regarding special and differential treatment, the thought was there, as was the provision, but there was no legally binding obligation. There had been in the past a gross imbalance in negotiating strength between developed and developing countries. Offers regarding special and differential treatment were made on a ""take it or leave it"" basis, and developing countries often preferred that there be provisions couched in expressions such as ""It is recognised that…"" rather than not to have anything at all. That situation had changed, and developing countries legitimately sought more. He admitted that his WT/COMTD/M/25 Page 12 delegation had been remiss in not providing a response to the questionnaire, and that they were willing to make available their proposals to the CTD. He said that there was no dearth of proposals regarding special and differential treatment, and mentioned proposals submitted by the Egyptian and Pakistan delegations as examples. His delegation looked forward to a meaningful discussion in the CTD.","WTCOMTDM25.pdf","India, Uruguay, Round, Seattle, Ministerial, Conference, CTD, Pakistan, CTD"
"2063",2063,"48","48.      The representative of India said that the problem with special and differential treatment was threefold. First some provisions were unclear; second, where they were clear there was no binding obligation; and third, there was no political will to implement obligations where they existed. The proposals made by the Indian delegation called for wholesale amendments in some areas. He refered to the example of Article 15 of the Agreement on Anti-Dumping Measures, cited by the representative of Egypt, and said the problem lay in the fact that Article 15 began with the words ""It is recognised…"". These words effectively reduced the obligation on developed countries to nil, and developed countries were thus able in all legitimacy to tell developing countries that they recognised that special regard was to be given to developing countries, but that developed countries would take no action and that, furthermore, there was nothing developing countries could do either. Were these words ""It is recognised"" to be deleted, Article 15 would become a legally binding obligation which had to be enforced, and developing countries would challenge developed countries under the Dispute Settlement Mechanism in the event of non-implementation. With weak language, and without political will, special and differential treatment would remain on paper, and for the next 40 years developed countries would continue to affirm that special and differential treatment provisions existed, but that nothing would be done to implement them. The problem was thus a little more complicated than intimated by the Japanese delegation: it was not simply a question of replying to the questionnaire. The issues involved were more complex, as pointed out by the representative of Norway.","WTCOMTDM25.pdf","India, Egypt, Norway"
"2062",2062,"47","47.      The representative of India supported the Moroccan proposal for a seminar on special and differential treatment and the statement made by the delegation of Egypt. Regarding the Secretariat note, it was true that responses to the questionnaire had not been forthcoming. It was equally true that some Members had made statements in the General Council. He said his delegation would copy their proposal relating to special and differential treatment made in the General Council to the Director of the Development Division. While the proposal did not follow entirely the format of the questionnaire, it would provide information that could be used in the preparation of the note.","WTCOMTDM25.pdf","India, Egypt, Secretariat, Members, General, Council, General, Council, Director"
"2061",2061,"46","46.      The representative of Egypt said that there was thus a range of issues and a range of problems, and the whole subject was complex. There were various categories of special and differential treatment with various problems: while some provisions were vague and required clarification, others were very clear, but were still not implemented as there was no legal obligation to inform Members regarding implementation. This was precisely why a paper by the Secretariat was needed, in order to ascertain the difficulties associated with the subject of special and differential treatment, to address the problems identified, and facilitate discussion on the issue. His delegation were concerned at the delay in the preparation of the document, especially as it had been expected that the paper would be ready by the 25th Session of the CTD, as indicated by former Deputy Director-General, Mr. Hoda.","WTCOMTDM25.pdf","Egypt, Members, Secretariat, CTD, Director-General, Hoda"
"2060",2060,"45","45.      The representative of Egypt said that an example of provisions that were implemented in all their terms were provisions for transitional time-periods. There were no difficulties in implementing transitional periods, whether in relation to Customs Valuation, TRIPS, SPS or others. Another example of areas where there were no difficulties in implementation was in relation to Annex VII(b) of the Agreement on Subsidies and Countervailing Duties, which stated that countries with a per capita income of less than US$1,000 had certain rights. These rights were being used. In contrast, if one considered Article 15 of the Agreement on Anti-Dumping Measures, which stipulated that special regard was to be given by developed countries to the special situation of developing country members, no response was given to questions as to how such a provision was being implemented. Article 15 also stipulated that the possibility of constructive remedies was to be explored prior to the                                                                                     WT/COMTD/M/25                                                                                            Page 11 imposition of anti-dumping measures, yet when information was requested of developed countries in relation to the implementation of this provision, the response given was that there was no obligation to respond.","WTCOMTDM25.pdf","Egypt, Customs, Valuation, SPS"
"2059",2059,"44","44.      The representative of Egypt said it was not the intention of his delegation to blame the Secretariat, but rather to indicate that his delegation had been awaiting the paper on the implementation of provisions for special and differential treatment for a very long time, and that it was not necessary to await further information in order to make progress on the paper. He agreed that the work of the Secretariat would be facilitated if more responses from developing and developed Members were forthcoming. Regarding the point made by the European Communities on the identification of specific examples of non implementation, he said that the paper WT/COMTD/W/49 contained a number of examples. One such example was in relation to Article 10.6 of the TBT agreement, which indicated that the Secretariat of the WTO should draw the attention of developing countries to notifications relating to products of particular interest to them. This was also to be found in paragraph 9 of annex B of the SPS agreement. He said that this provision was not implemented in a systematic manner, and that this issue had been raised in the Committee on SPS. A second example concerned Article 9 of the SPS agreement which stated that ""Where substantial investments are required in order for an exporting developing country Member to fulfil the sanitary or phytosanitary requirements of an importing Member, the latter shall consider providing such technical assistance as will permit the developing country Member to maintain and expand its market access opportunities for the product involved"". There was no information as to the implementation of this provision. If responses were not coming through the questionnaire, it should be indicated that there was no information. If there was no information, one possible conclusion would be to change the provision of information into a notification obligation.","WTCOMTDM25.pdf","Egypt, Secretariat, Secretariat, Members, TBT, Secretariat, WTO, SPS, Committee, SPS, SPS, Member, Member, Member"
"2058",2058,"43","43.     The representative of the European Communities said that the representative of Uruguay had made a useful point regarding the use of checklists. However, the process of identification of issues was an evolving process. The purpose of answering the questionnaire was different, as it sought to provide an opportunity to delegations which felt that there were shortcomings in the implementation to point to specific agreements where a provision existed, but had not been implemented. She emphasised that the concept of implementation was not a generic concept but one that had legal implications, and hence it was necessary to point to specific examples of non implementation. It was important to differentiate clearly between lack of implementation of specific provisions under specific agreements, which could be addressed in a concrete manner with a view to finding solutions, and a general assessment which may lead to further negotiations and thence to changes in agreements once agreed.","WTCOMTDM25.pdf","European, Communities, Uruguay"
"2057",2057,"42","42.      The representative of Switzerland said his delegation supported the proposal made by the Director of the Development Division as a way out of the current deadlock. He said his delegation did not wish to blame the Secretariat and recalled that the WTO was a ""Member-driven"" organisation in the first place. He said that one reason why there were only a few replies was the fact that the subject of special and differential treatment was very broad, covering a range of agreements, and thus the completion of the questionnaire demanded considerable resources. The seminar could be a useful way forward for the time being, but that this did not make the completion of a questionnaire unnecessary, especially as the information required in response to the questionnaire would have to be provided in order to prepare for the seminar.","WTCOMTDM25.pdf","Switzerland, Director, Development, Division, Secretariat, WTO"

While he did not contest the view expressed by the representative of Egypt that its was possible make progress on the completion of the paper without further contributions, his delegation felt that the document would be more representative and comprehensive if more responses were given, particularly from developing countries. His delegation agreed with the delegation of Japan, and echoed by the European Communities, that responses to the questionnaire would provide detailed information not readily accessible in other WTO fora. The seminar would be useful as a supplement to the questionnaire, but that this should not detract from the importance of the questionnaire.

"2055",2055,"40","40.      The representative of Bangladesh said the issue of special and differential treatment was of great importance to his delegation. He shared the views of the delegation of the Republic of Korea to the effect that the unclear nature of provisions for special and differential treatment made their implementation difficult. Special and differential treatment amounted to no more than a sugar coating of the WTO agreements, and had proved to be of little substance. He felt, however, that there was still time for Members to remedy existing lacunae in these provisions, which were of an autonomous nature, whose implementation depended on the good intent of developed country partners, and which were not enforceable. There was a lack of urgency surrounding the implementation of provisions for special and differential treatment. Members should address this problem of special and differential treatment rather than delve into the particularities of individual agreements. Given that the WTO was entering a new phase in which the Marrakesh agreements were being reviewed, and given the recognition by the international community of the development needs of developing countries, the issue of special and differential treatment could be examined in its entirety in the forthcoming negotiations, with a view to developing provisions that were less autonomous, more enforceable, and could translate into binding commitments. His delegation supported the proposal by the European Communities that there be a seminar on special and differential treatment as early as possible. A seminar would bring out issues for discussion and would provide guidance as to areas of work that would enable the development of more substantive and implementable provisions for special and differential treatment.","WTCOMTDM25.pdf","Bangladesh, Republic, of, Korea, WTO, Members, Members, WTO, Marrakesh"

The Chairperson thanked the outgoing chairman of the Sub-Committee, the Permanent Representative of Denmark, Ambassador Hans Henrik Bruun, for his able leadership of the Sub- Committee on Least-Developed Countries. Ambassador Bruun had successfully led the Sub- Committee's work last year. During his tenure as chairman, two issues were brought forward by the Sub-Committee through the Committee on Trade and Development to the attention of the General Council; market access for least-developed country exports, and difficulties faced by least-developed countries in implementing WTO Agreements. It was also on his initiative that the Secretariat was asked to begin to compile information on the market access barriers facing least-developed countries' exports. She was confident that Ambassador Bruun would continue to participate actively in the work of the Sub-Committee.","WTCOMTDM25.pdf","Chairperson, chairman, Denmark, Ambassador, Hans, Henrik, Bruun, Sub, -, Committee, on, Least-Developed, Countries, Ambassador, Bruun, Sub, -, Committee, chairman, Sub-Committee, Committee, on, Trade, and, Development, General, Council, WTO, Secretariat, Ambassador, Bruun"

The representative of Uruguay said the question of special and differential treatment had been discussed extensively in the General Council, along with other issues affecting developing countries. While some of the statements made in the General Council had been of a general nature, the statements made by his delegation, and others, had been very specific, identifying concrete problems under specific agreements. He noted that a number of checklists had been prepared in connection with the General Council process. These documents were informal documents, and could constitute the basis of work to be done by the Secretariat, as they contained a wealth of information on a number of topics discussed by delegations. This information could be extracted and utilised; it was important that there be no duplication of work by the Secretariat. He recalled that his delegation had submitted a proposal which set out, in relation to the checklists, a methodology which enabled the identification of different themes discussed, and the establishing of a certain order to questions raised and answers thereto.","WTCOMTDM25.pdf","Uruguay, General, Council, General, Council, General, Council, Secretariat, Secretariat"

From the outset, there had been a recognition of the lack of specific resources, which is why the Secretariat had requested member states to provide input as to the difficulties they faced under specific agreements. He recalled that former Deputy Director-General, Mr. Hoda, had stated that it was difficult to provide a correct analysis without member-specific input. It was therefore not appropriate to blame the Secretariat for not having completed the task, but that responsibility lay more with delegations. He supported the proposal made by the Director of the Development Division that an informal paper be circulated, as this would elicit comments and contributions from delegations.","WTCOMTDM25.pdf","Japan, Secretariat, Director-General, Hoda, Secretariat, Director, Development, Division"

"2050",2050,"36","36.     The representative of the Republic of Korea said his delegation were of the view that the low level of responses to the questionnaire stemmed in part from the vagueness of several special and differential provisions. There were several different types of provisions: some specified transition times for the implementation of agreements, while others stated that implementing countries should make best efforts to take into account the interests of developing and least developed Members. His delegation shared the view expressed by the European Communities that the implementation of special and differential treatment had not been discussed elsewhere on a point by point basis. He added that the discussion of the implementation of provisions for special and differential treatment on a point by point basis could be taken up under Agenda Item 2:H dealing with possible inputs into the Seattle Ministerial Conference.","WTCOMTDM25.pdf","Republic, of, Korea, Members, Seattle, Ministerial, Conference"

Second, his delegation were of the view that the various papers submitted regarding implementation issues should not be confused with the exercise that was being carried out by the CTD. What was required was concrete evidence regarding difficulties in the implementation of provisions for special and differential treatment, whereas most of the submissions made in the General Council debate were of a more generic nature that did not identify, by agreement or by country, specific difficulties in the implementation of special and differential provisions. Third, regarding alternative means of reflecting on special and differential treatment suggested by Morocco, he indicated that one members State of the Communities was discussing with the Secretariat the possibility of holding a seminar on the implementation of special and differential treatment before the summer break. More information would be provided to the CTD once dates had been finalised.","WTCOMTDM25.pdf","European, Communities, Director, General, Council, Morocco, Secretariat, CTD"

He said that the statement made by Morocco deserved to be noted, and that his delegation associated itself fully with that statement. His delegation were to a large degree on agreement with the views expressed by the Egyptian delegation, though his delegation did not wish to blame the Secretariat for not having completed the paper on special and differential treatment. He said that implementation issues recurred as a leitmotif in the CTD and other committees. The lack of an encouraging response was in part due to the fact that members were wary of what precisely could be done. He said that the compendium of statements made at the Ministerial Conference provided information on implementation difficulties. There was an abundance of sources of information which should be put to good use, and hence the lack of response to the questionnaire did not have to be taken to be a problem. It was important that statements made and papers submitted be utilised, lest they remain as mere papers without further use.","WTCOMTDM25.pdf","Mauritius, Morocco, Secretariat, CTD"
"2045",2045,"31","31.      Egypt fully supported the statement made by the delegation of Morocco, and the proposal for the convening of a seminar on special and differential treatment. His delegation was extremely disappointed that the contribution of the Secretariat in relation to the issue of special and differential treatment had not been forthcoming. His delegation had indicated on numerous occasions that responses to questions should not be a precondition to the preparation of the paper. One year had passed since the proposals made by the delegation of Morocco, and an analytical paper on aspects of special and differential treatment was still awaited. His delegation had pointed to a number of sources of information on special and differential treatment, but that nevertheless the paper had not been forthcoming. His delegation had on a number of occasions said that technical assistance activities, Trade Policy Reviews, minutes of meeting and other sources could be used. In addition, his delegation had indicated that the paper on special and differential treatment it had submitted to the General Council and to the CTD, as WT/COMTD/W/49, was to be considered the Egyptian contribution to the discussion of special and differential treatment, and to the paper to be prepared by the Secretariat. Much discussion had taken place in the General Council, and a number of papers had been submitted, including one by the delegation of India. There had also been an extensive discussion of special and differential treatment in various committees in connection with various agreements. His delegation took note of the statement made by the Director of the Development Division, thanked him for it, and expressed the hope that the note would be circulated as soon as possible. The issue of special and differential treatment was very important for a number of developing countries, and his delegation hoped that it could be addressed with the urgency it deserved.

He hoped that the three proposals his delegation had made in June 1998 would not effectively be buried; it was the conviction of his and other delegations that these proposals represented the way forward if the concept of special and differential treatment was to be meaningful.","WTCOMTDM25.pdf","Morocco, CTD, WTO"
"2041",2041,"28","28.     The representative of Morocco thanked the Secretariat for the information provided and the efforts made in the preparation of the document. He said that it would be useful to recall the framework within which the decision had been taken by the CTD to prepare the questionnaire. His delegation had, at the CTD meeting of June 1998, agreed to work on three aspects in order to make                                                                                      WT/COMTD/M/25                                                                                              Page 7 operational the discussion of Special and Differential Treatment within the CTD. The first aspect was the assessment of problems encountered by developed, developing and least developed countries in the implementation of Special and Differential provisions. The second aspect was the evaluation of economic and commercial effects of the implementation, or non-implementation, of special and differential provisions since the conclusion of the Uruguay Round. The third aspect consisted of the evaluation of the concept of special and differential treatment itself, in order to revitalise and operationalize it for the benefit of WTO Members. The questionnaire on special and differential treatment circulated by the Secretariat thus fell within the first of the three aspects. He noted that the questionnaire method had proved to be problematic in a number of international organisations, mainly due to the fact that some countries lacked the capacity to respond in detail to the questions asked. He said his delegation believed that while the CTD should persevere with the questionnaire, it should also reflect on alternative methods of evaluating difficulties in the implementation of Special and Differential provisions. His delegation found the suggestions made by the Director of the Development Division were acceptable, and could go along with them.","WTCOMTDM25.pdf","Morocco, Secretariat, CTD, CTD, Uruguay, Round, WTO, Members, Secretariat, CTD, Director"
"2040",2040,"27","27.      The Director of the Development Division said it would be very difficult, if not impossible, to give a meaningful answer to the question of difficulties in implementation of special and differential provisions on the basis of the few replies that had been submitted by members. One possibility would be to present, as an informal paper initially, the essence of the replies received by the five delegations – and any others, were they to submit replies – and also the essence of the material collected from within the Secretariat. The possibility existed, once delegations had provided further input on the basis of the informal paper, to present a formal working paper of the CTD. He concluded by reiterating that information by members was one of the essential elements for the completion of the paper, and he appealed to all members to present answers to the questionnaire circulated by the Secretariat.","WTCOMTDM25.pdf","Director, Development, Division, Secretariat, CTD, Secretariat"
"2039",2039,"26","26.     The Director of the Development Division said that, unfortunately, there had been no new replies since the meeting of 5 May, despite the expressions of willingness that had been made. Replies that had been given by five countries – Hong Kong, China; Japan, Norway, Madagascar and Singapore – gave a picture of what had been done and what remained to be done regarding the implementation of provisions on Special and Differential Treatment. He drew the attention of the CTD to the reply by Madagascar – an LDC – which made links between several special and differential provisions and the need for technical assistance. In terms of information in the Secretariat, requests had been made to each division to provide information relating to the special and differential provisions or development related provisions of each of the WTO agreements of understandings for which they were responsible. A substantial amount of information had been provided based on discussion in the relevant Committees, and this information was being analysed and reviewed for completeness. Discussions held in the context of the General Council Intersessional process were not dealt with, these discussions being covered by checklists that had been circulated periodically by the Ministerial Sessions Division. The main areas where difficulties in the application of Special and Differential provisions had been reported by developing countries included Dispute Settlement, SPS, TRIMS, Textiles and the Net-Food Importing provisions of the Agreement on agriculture. He added that there were some areas in which difficulties reported in other fora, such as the Intersessional process, had not been raised strongly, if at all, in Committee meetings. Such areas included the Committee on Balance-of-Payments Restrictions, the Committee on Import Licensing and the Committee on Market Access. In addition to these sources of information, the Trade Policy Review Mechanism had, in its reviews, shown a number of areas where the treatment of developing countries had been seen by themselves as having been inadequate. Areas cited included the operation of GSP schemes; the treatment of countries under anti-dumping procedures, difficulties in the operation of balance-of-payments provisions, problems related to standards and SPS, backloading of liberalisation under the Agreement on Textiles and Clothing, the ability of small members to participate effectively in the DSU, and the clearly identified need for technical assistance in the fields of customs valuation, standards and tariff negotiations.","WTCOMTDM25.pdf","Director, Development, Division, Hong, Kong, China, Japan, Norway, Madagascar, Singapore, CTD, Madagascar, Secretariat, WTO, General, Council, Intersessional, SPS, Committee, Committee, on, Balance-of-Payments, Restrictions, Committee, on, Import, Licensing, Committee, on, Market, Access, Trade, Policy, Review, Mechanism, GSP, SPS"

The completion and circulation of the Note had been delayed because of the exceptionally low rate of returns to the Questionnaire first circulated by the Secretariat on 12 November 1998 with an initial deadline of the completed questionnaire fixed for 25 January 1999. To date, only five Members had completed and returned the questionnaires. These were: Hong Kong, China; Japan; Madagascar, Norway and Singapore.

Trade liberalisation was based on the removal of tariff and non tariff barriers, and the establishment of a free-trade area between member countries. Two members, Morocco and Tunisia, had signed an agreement which would enter into effect in July 1999. The Union envisaged that the free trade area between members would be done in coordination with the association agreements of the European Union, creating bilateral free trade agreements with each of the countries in the Union. Maximum encouragement and promotion of the investment was given through the provision of national treatment and MFN, as well as various financial and juridical incentives.

WAEMU comprised eight countries of West Africa which had as a common currency the CFA franc. The countries were Benin, Burkina Faso, Côte d'Ivoire, Guinea-Bissau, Mali, Niger, Senegal and Togo. These countries in 1994 decided to transform their monetary union into economic union with five main objectives: the establishment of a common market based on the free movement of goods, services, persons, and capital; the establishment of a common trade policy vis-à-vis third countries; to ensure the convergence of political policy through a multilateral surveillance procedure; harmonisation of taxation policy and coordination of sectoral policy. Significant progress had been made since 1994 especially with regard to the common market; as of 1 January 2000, products from the Union would circulate at free of duty. For products from third countries, a common external tariff would also be implemented as of 1 January 2000. The tariff set the highest level of customs duty at 21 per cent; prior to 1997, member States had rates of between 38 and 65 per cent, and the rate of 21 per cent therefore represented an important effort in participating in globalisation. In the area of taxation, a harmonisation process had been developed, and was to be progressively applied in consideration of constraints faced by member States. Regarding economic policy coordination, criteria of budgetary surveillance had been put into place, and were considered half-yearly to examine how policies can be harmonised.","WTCOMTDM25.pdf","West, African, Economic, and, Monetary, Union, Members, CTD, WAEMU, West, Africa, Benin, Burkina, Faso, Guinea-Bissau, Mali, Niger, Senegal, Togo"

"2014",2014,"178","178.     The representative of Brazil said she wished to further explain the position taken by her delegation. Her delegation had already taken a similar position on the Council on Trade in Services, where it had , made known its view that no specific tasks were to be undertaken in subsidiary bodies and presented to the General Council in the context of preparations for the Ministerial Conference. Nothing precluded delegations from bringing to the General Council specific proposals that were the result of work carried out in subsidiary bodies such as the CTD. However, unless the General Council specifically mandated the CTD to undertake a specific task regarding the preparation of the Ministerial, her delegation were of the view that the CTD should not attempt to make such a contribution, as this would create a precedent which could lead other subsidiary bodies to do likewise. This would be problematic for developing countries who typically had small delegations and who consequently would not be able to control work across a number of different subsidiary bodies. She said that the Geneva Ministerial Declaration clearly mandated the General Council with the task of preparing the Third Ministerial Conference, and hence the work should be conducted in the General Council, at which all delegations could be present all the time. She said that the CTD had an important role, and should discuss issues pertaining to the Third Ministerial Conference, and should help developing countries to prepare their positions for the Ministerial Conference. Delegations could then bring to the General Council their proposals that stemmed from the discussion of the CTD, but her delegation could not agree to a formal, structured proposal on the part of the CTD.

The representative of Morocco said, with reference to the statement by the representative of Brazil, said that if the work undertaken by the CTD was to be of any use, it needed to be presented formally through the General Council to the Third Ministerial Conference. He refered to the Singapore Ministerial Conference, for which the CTD had made a specific proposal concerning the Action Plan for Least Developed Countries through the General Council, and urged the delegation of Brazil to go along with the idea that the CTD present a formal contribution.","WTCOMTDM25.pdf","Morocco, Brazil, CTD, General, Council, Singapore, CTD, General, Council, Brazil, CTD"

He said that there had been strong support in favour of updating the Secretariat Note on the participation of developing countries in international trade, and said that there would not be any objection were the Secretariat to begin work on the paper. He expressed the hope that that the paper to be produced by the Secretariat regarding possible inputs into the preparatory process for the Seattle Ministerial Conference would take into account the discussion Members had had in the 25th Session of the CTD. He requested that informal consultations be held prior to the 26th Session of the CTD so as to allow Members to seek agreement on the analytical work to be carried out by the CTD in connection with the preparatory process.","WTCOMTDM25.pdf","Egypt, Secretariat, Secretariat, Secretariat, Seattle, Ministerial, Conference, Members, CTD, CTD, Members, CTD"

The representative of Brazil said it was the understanding of her delegation that there had been agreement that the CTD would work on and discuss issues that potentially had a bearing on the work of the General Council. There was no agreement, however, that the CTD should present a formal contribution to the General Council. She reiterated her delegation's view that the statements made in the CTD would also be brought up in the General Council.

The representative of the European Communities reiterated that recommendations would be prepared by the General Council. One possibility for the CTD was to gather the points made by various delegations regarding possible inputs, and structure them according to paragraphs 8, 9 and 10 of the Geneva Ministerial Declaration. He noted that there appeared to be a large degree of consensus regarding the issues of implementation, special and differential treatment, and technical assistance, and said that the CTD should begin work on this forthwith.","WTCOMTDM25.pdf","European, Communities, CTD, European, Communities, General, Council, CTD, CTD"

She said the Informal Note had provided a useful basis for discussions. On the basis of the deliberations that had been held, it was necessary to identify the points that could be submitted to the General Council in order that useful contribution to the Seattle Ministerial Conference be prepared. It was also necessary to consider the longer term work programme. She requested the Secretariat to produce a new Informal Note as soon as possible on the basis of a number of suggestions made by delegations, following from the statements made by the delegations of Egypt and Morocco, to facilitate discussions during the 26th Session of the CTD scheduled for 7 July 1999. She expressed the hope that the contribution made by the CTD to the General Council would be as important as that made by the CTD prior to the Singapore Ministerial Conference.","WTCOMTDM25.pdf","Chairperson, General, Council, Secretariat, Egypt, Morocco, CTD, CTD, General, Council, CTD"

She said her delegation would go along with the consensus that seemed to have emerged regarding procedure. She said her delegation wished to flag the following substantive issues: first, trade facilitation, which was a subject that her delegation believed fell within the purview of the CTD, and regarding which the CTD could make specific recommendations, particularly in the light of complications faced by developing countries in the implementation of Uruguay Round Agreements. Second, her delegation believed that Part IV of the GATT provided the mandate for the CTD to look into trade problems faced by developing countries. A situation had arisen where actions taken by countries had failed to address the concerns embodied in Part IV. Her delegation were of the view that a report on Part IV of GATT 1994 be considered, given that it had been drafted at a time when rules covered only trade in goods, whereas presently rules covered trade in agriculture and services as well. Third, she said that preference margins under the GSP had been eroded, adding that her delegation, along with others, had submitted to the General Council proposals regarding this issue. While some argued that preferences had led to an inefficient allocation of resources, Sri Lanka was of the view that preferences had generated benefits. Finally, her delegation associated itself fully with the statements made by the delegations of Mauritius, Guatemala, Barbados and Bolivia regarding the problem of small economies. The subject of small economies should be included in the list of issues regarding a possible input to the Seattle Ministerial Conference. She drew attention to the specific issue of customs revenue, highlighting the importance of such sources of revenue to small economies for the purposes of implementing development programmes. She said the Sri Lankan government had undertaken research which demonstrated the revenue implications of trade liberalisation. She said that Sri Lanka, like other small economies, did not seek the creation of a special category within the WTO but rather the recognition of the concerns faced by small economies.","WTCOMTDM25.pdf","Sri, Lanka, Secretariat, CTD, Egypt, Morocco, CTD, CTD, Uruguay, GATT, CTD, GATT, GSP, General, Council, Sri, Lanka, Mauritius, Guatemala, Barbados, Bolivia, Seattle, Ministerial, Conference, Sri, Lanka, WTO"

She was unable to support the proposals made by Egypt and Morocco owing to her absence from the CTD at the time, but looked forward to learning more about the proposals. She said the whole issue of small economies was one of different levels of development, rather than of categorisation, and she sought to reassure the delegation of the United States in this respect. She said that the issues of implementation, special and differential treatment, and technical assistance were of importance and should be the focus of the work of the CTD.","WTCOMTDM25.pdf","Barbados, Secretariat, Egypt, Morocco, CTD, United, States, CTD"
"2001",2001,"166","166.     The representative of Bolivia thanked the Secretariat for the Informal Note. He said that his delegation had repeatedly expressed in the General Council that the General Council was the only appropriate forum to discuss preparatory work for the Ministerial Conference. He said the contribution of the CTD should therefore concentrate on the subject of implementation, taking into account both the difficulties developing countries have experienced in implementing WTO agreements owing to shortfalls in human and institutional capacity, and also difficulties experienced in market access. He said implementation covered the issues of special and differential treatment and technical assistance. He said that implementation also entailed working in accordance with the Geneva Ministerial Declaration, in which concern was expressed at the marginalisation of LDCs. He said he fully agreed with the representatives of Guatemala and Mauritius that there was no intention to create of separate categories of Members, but rather to ensure that the diversity of developing countries be recognised. An analysis of implementation would show that there were general difficulties common to all developing countries, and some that were specific to certain countries as a function of their level of development and particularities in their trade and economic structure.","WTCOMTDM25.pdf","Bolivia, Secretariat, General, Council, General, Council, CTD, WTO, Guatemala, Mauritius, Members"

ASEAN agreed that the responsibility for the scope, modalities and so forth of future negotiations lay with the General Council. It was nevertheless to recognise that the CTD had a vital role in providing inputs on developmental aspects to the Seattle Ministerial Conference. He said that it was difficult to avoid some degree of duplication of the work of other committees given the horizontal nature of the CTD's work.

Her delegation shared the view expressed by the delegation of Switzerland that the CTD should provide a contribution to the Ministerial Conference, and in this regard should seek to prioritise themes for the Ministerial Conference. One such priority was a contribution to the declaration. Her delegation supported the holding of a seminar on special and differential treatment, and concrete recommendations arising out of this could be brought to the Ministerial Conference.","WTCOMTDM25.pdf","Panama, Egypt, Morocco, Switzerland"
"1998",1998,"163","163.    The representative of Guatemala said his delegation was in full agreement with the statement made by the representative of Mauritius to the effect that small and vulnerable economies were in no way seeking to establish a separate category within the Membership of the WTO. It was, rather, necessary that the limitations faced by small and vulnerable countries in the appropriation of the WT/COMTD/M/25 Page 44 benefits of the trade liberalisation promoted by the WTO be properly understood, especially in the context of the forthcoming negotiations, during which these limitations should be taken into account. The representative of Guatemala said his delegation were in agreement with the themes mentioned by the delegation of India, namely, implementation issues, technical assistance and special and differential treatment. However, small and vulnerable economies had further concerns in addition to these, such as the restricted size of domestic markets and production; the concentration of their production in certain agricultural commodities; and their insignificant level of industrial development. It was important that these limitations be recognised, and that joint mechanisms be sought that enabled small economies to share in the common benefits of the multilateral trading system, and not simply to incur obligation with which it was difficult to comply. His delegation was perfectly aware that the major responsibility lay internally, and Guatemala intended to fulfil its responsibility.","WTCOMTDM25.pdf","Guatemala, Mauritius, WTO, WTO, Guatemala, India, Guatemala"

Nevertheless, his delegation viewed with sympathy the suggestion that the CTD make a contribution to the General Council. In this perspective, his delegation looked favourably on the list of topics presented by the representative of Egypt, and the complementary proposals made by Morocco. However, given that only six months remained until the Ministerial Conference, a pragmatic approach which would focus on a few specific issues was required. In keeping with the suggestions made by the delegation of India, these issues were the difficulties faced by developing countries in the implementation of Uruguay Round Agreements; special and differential treatment; and technical cooperation.","WTCOMTDM25.pdf","Colombia, Seattle, Ministerial, Conference, General, Council, CTD, General, Council, Egypt, Morocco, India, Uruguay"

The representative of Brazil said that there was agreement that the preparatory process for the Seattle Ministerial Conference be handled by the General Council, and that there was little doubt as to the process by which this was to be done. It was agreed that the CTD had a role to play in the WTO and that its work was of a horizontal nature. It was also agreed that the CTD and other subsidiary bodies should discuss issues that had some bearing on the Ministerial Conference. It was the perception of her delegation that discussions held in the CTD would flow naturally to the General Council through proposals brought by individual delegations. As long as the CTD did not seek to innovate or inaugurate a process, and as long as the discussion centred around focussing the work programme of the CTD on preparations for the Ministerial Conference, her delegation did not perceive there to be a problem. She suggested that a pragmatic approach be taken, with a focus on issues such as special and differential treatment, technical cooperation, anti-dumping, and so forth. Her delegation shared the view expressed by the European Communities that the priority at that moment was to collect issues for discussion, with a view to deciding subsequently as to the specific areas on which work was to be conducted.","WTCOMTDM25.pdf","Brazil, Seattle, Ministerial, Conference, General, Council, CTD, WTO, CTD, CTD, General, Council, CTD, CTD"

He said the title made clear that the contents of the note were tentative suggestions and not hard and fast proposals. He said that the role of the CTD was, inter alia, to monitor all aspects of the participation of developing countries, including the implementation of special and differential provisions and the delivery of technical assistance. It was important not to lose sight of the past work of the CTD. For instance the CTD was recognised as having produced the work plan on LDCs for the Singapore Ministerial Conference. He said that the integration of developing countries into the multilateral trading system raised a number of issues, including, inter alia, special and differential treatment, technical cooperation, notification issues, and consideration of the effects of agricultural reform on net-food importing developing countries. Bearing this in mind, it remained for the CTD to decide what was rational, feasible and acceptable for it to do. He concluded by stating, in response to an observation made by the representative of the United States, that his neither his delegation nor others sought to create new categories in the WTO. All that was sought was an examination of the concerns of small and vulnerable economies.","WTCOMTDM25.pdf","Mauritius, Secretariat, CTD, CTD, CTD, Singapore, CTD, United, States, WTO"
"1994",1994,"16","16.      The representative of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) thanked the Director-General of the WTO for the recognition given to ECOWAS through the granting of ad hoc observer status to meetings of the CTD. He said ECOWAS was often viewed as an organisation the function of which was peace-keeping and conflict resolution, as evidenced in Liberia and Sierra Leone. It was the view of ECOWAS that there could be no free movement of persons and goods, no commercial trading, no economic growth or development, without peace. However, far from being an organisation exclusively devoted to the conflict resolution and peacekeeping, ECOWAS was first and foremost an economic community of 16 West African states, whose objectives were to promote economic cooperation and integration within the context of an economic union for West Africa, with the purpose of raising the standards of living of its people, of maintaining and increasing economic stability, strengthening relations between members states, and contributing to development on the African continent. To achieve these objectives, the Community sought to create a common market through trade liberalisation amongst Members. It sought to establish a common external tariff and a common trade policy amongst members. The removal of obstacles to the free circulation of good, persons, services and capital, along with rights to residence and establishment were integral to the concerns of ECOWAS. He said ECOWAS was intent on achieving economic union through the adoption of common economic and financial policies, notably in the context of monetary union, and also adopting common policies in cultural and social affairs. He said the WTO and ECOWAS were heading in the same direction, and that closer cooperation was necessary to ensure the integration of West Africa into international trade flows. ECOWAS was the only African community in which individuals could freely circulate from one member state to another WT/COMTD/M/25 Page 4 without a visa. Customs papers and systems for the designation and codification of goods from 16 member states had been harmonised. As of 1 January 2000, products accepted for the ECOWAS free trade system would have a zero tariff across all member states. He recalled that ECOWAS was the cradle for automated system for customs data, a system for the processing of trade data, which was currently utilised by customs administrations in more than 50 countries across the world. ECOWAS had implemented a vast programme for the promotion of trade and raising awareness of economic operators about the trade potential in the region. Programmes were underway for land and telecommunication links, for road construction and rehabilitation, and a programme for monetary cooperation whose purpose was the creation of a single monetary zone. The legal framework was being updated so as to create a sound investment environment. He reiterated that the WTO and ECOWAS had to collaborate as partners who were mutual in their support of growth in trade and investment with a view to furthering development in West Africa.","WTCOMTDM25.pdf","Economic, Community, of, West, African, States, ECOWAS, Director-General, WTO, ECOWAS, CTD, ECOWAS, Liberia, Sierra, Leone, ECOWAS, ECOWAS, West, Africa, Members, ECOWAS, ECOWAS, WTO, ECOWAS, West, Africa, ECOWAS, Customs, ECOWAS, ECOWAS, ECOWAS, WTO, ECOWAS, West, Africa"
"1993",1993,"159","159.     The representative of Senegal thanked the Secretariat for the Informal Note. His delegation associated itself with the remarks made by the representative of Egypt to the effect that the CTD should focus on issues within its mandate. The representative of Senegal addressed the issue of technical cooperation, and said that it was incumbent on Members to ensure that technical cooperation activities were relevant, visible, and had a concrete impact on beneficiary Members. Ways needed to be explored to ensure that the Seattle Ministerial conference reaffirmed the importance of technical cooperation as a fundamental means of achieving the goals of the WTO, and the integration of developing countries into the global economy through international trade. Such a reaffirmation at the highest level of the value of technical cooperation would serve as a political support for the future directions taken by technical cooperation activities. Another issue of importance was the integration of LDCs into the multilateral trading system. The excessive dependence of LDCs on the export of a few primary commodities to a few markets, combined with asymmetries between their export revenue and expenditures on imports, was widely recognised as contributing to the fragility of their economies. The deterioration of terms of trade, and the burden of debt, were two factors which impeded the growth of LDCs, and developing countries in general. It was therefore necessary that commitments Members had undertaken in relation to LDCs be honoured, and that new and ambitious                                                                                      WT/COMTD/M/25                                                                                             Page 43 initiatives be adopted in favour of LDCs. He referred in this respect to a proposal made by the delegation of Bangladesh to the General Council, and indicated that his delegation would consult with the delegation of Bangladesh as how best to take up the proposal in the CTD. Referring to the question of regional and sub-regional arrangements, he said that the interpenetration of economic areas was indispensable for counties like his which suffered from the fragmentation of markets and lack of scale. He said this was a priority issue for his delegation, and said that the Seattle Ministerial Conference should be the occasion to reaffirm the importance of such arrangements, and not an occasion to throw into question what had already been established regarding this topic.","WTCOMTDM25.pdf","Senegal, Secretariat, Egypt, CTD, Senegal, Members, Members, Seattle, Ministerial, WTO, Members, Bangladesh, General, Council, Bangladesh, CTD, Seattle, Ministerial, Conference"
"1992",1992,"158","158.     The representative of Japan said that his capital was still scrutinising the detail of the Informal Note. He said that the Secretariat Note was a good basis for discussion, and covered a wide range of issues discussed at the informal session. Further work needed to be conducted on the document, possibly involving a reduction in the number of topics covered in order to keep within the mandate of the CTD. Regarding questions of procedure, he said that a substantive issue was taking place on paragraph 9, which dealt with. inter alia, implementation issues and follow up to the High-Level Meeting on LDCs. Similarly, there had been an informal General Council session on the question of credit for autonomous liberalisation. The question consisted therefore of how to integrate the CTD's input into discussions in the General Council, and how to avoid conflict with the work of the General Council. He noted that as of autumn, the General Council would enter the phase of drafting the Seattle Ministerial Declaration, and recalled the suggestion made by Mexico that a two-track approach be avoided and that the CTDs contribution be made by 30 September 1999. Care was needed, therefore, in dealing with questions relating to procedures followed by the CTD as it sought to prepare a contribution to the General Council.","WTCOMTDM25.pdf","Japan, Secretariat, CTD, CTD, General, Council, General, Council, General, Council, Seattle, Mexico, CTD, General, Council"
"1991",1991,"157","157.      The representative of Argentina said his delegation wished to associate itself with the consensus that questions relating to the scope, modalities and so forth of future trade negotiations be left to the General Council. His delegation did not as yet have specific instructions on how to proceed WT/COMTD/M/25 Page 42 regarding the preparatory process for the Seattle Ministerial Conference. It was not yet clear that the CTD needed to make a specific contribution at all to the General Council. He said that the preparatory process for the Seattle Ministerial Conference was driven by proposals made by Members, rather than on the basis of proposals by specific committees or councils. If indeed the CTD were to discuss a possible contribution to the General Council, he said it was very good to bear in mind the proposal made by Switzerland that one distinguish between the preparation of background documents, and the discussion of implementation problems faced developing countries, as this would facilitate the making of decisions with regard to a possible input into the preparatory process. His delegation wished to support the issues brought forward by the delegation of Egypt and Morocco, and particularly the proposal to update the document on the participation of developing countries in international trade. His delegation was also of the view that some work could be conducted on the distribution of benefits of the multilateral trading system, along with the question of the integration of developing countries into the multilateral trading system. The CTD could also discuss difficulties in the implementation of the Uruguay Round Agreements, along with the subjects of trade-related technical assistance and the follow up to the High-Level Meeting on LDCs. The CTD should take into account the work of the World Bank and UNCTAD on the subject of implementation to avoid the duplication of work. He said that his delegation was a small one, and would not like issues that were discussed in one particular forum to be discussed in a number of other fora. He cited as an example the issue of credit for autonomous liberalisation which was being discussed elsewhere than the CTD. Regarding the work programme of the CTD, he was favourable to the idea of proceeding point by point.","WTCOMTDM25.pdf","Argentina, General, Council, Seattle, Ministerial, Conference, CTD, General, Council, Seattle, Ministerial, Conference, Members, CTD, General, Council, Switzerland, Egypt, Morocco, CTD, Uruguay, CTD, World, Bank, UNCTAD, CTD, CTD"

The representative of the United States said her delegation agreed that some of the issues listed in the Informal Note were better left to the General Council and that the focus of the CTDs work should be on positive, practical contributions to the General Council. Her delegation were of the view that the list proposed by the delegation of Egypt was a useful starting point in order to develop an input of a practical and advisory nature to the General Council. Turning to specific issues, she said that her delegation did not necessarily share the views expressed by the Indian delegation regarding the deletion of certain words in particular special and differential provisions. With regard to small and vulnerable economies, her delegation did not believe that any measure should be taken that would appear to create a different category of Members, but rather that the concerns of small and vulnerable economies be addressed through existing provisions for special and differential treatment. Her delegation agreed completely with the intervention by Mexico on how to proceed, and notably that points 1 and 2 of the Informal Note were not directly relevant to the preparation of possible inputs to the General Council. She added that her delegation did not necessarily agree with all the statements presented in the Informal Note, or the assumptions that underpinned the. Her delegation was not of the view, for instance, that there was any inherent conflict between the TRIPS Agreement and the Convention on Biodiversity. In conclusion, her delegation welcomed the further investigation of proposals made by Egypt, Morocco, Canada, Mexico, the European Communities, and others, in order to develop recommendations to the General Council regarding the Third Ministerial Conference.","WTCOMTDM25.pdf","United, States, General, Council, General, Council, Egypt, General, Council, Members, Mexico, General, Council, Egypt, Morocco, Canada, Mexico, European, Communities, General, Council"
"1989",1989,"155","155.    The representative of India noted that there some points on which there was an emerging consensus, one of them being that issues regarding to scope, modalities and so forth of future trade negotiations should not be addressed in the CTD. Second, the point had been made that the CTD should make its contribution to the General Council. Third, the need to update the paper on the participation of developing countries in international trade had been stressed. His delegation fully associated itself with those who had made statements in support of these points. Regarding the way forward, he said that there appeared to be two distinct rubrics on which the CTD should focus. The first was some input to the General Council in view of the Seattle Ministerial Conference, and the second was the future work programme of the CTD. His delegation were of the view that it would be useful if the CTD were to focus on three issues prior to Seattle, namely difficulties faced by developing countries in the implementation of Uruguay Round Agreements, special and differential treatment, and technical assistance. These three issues should form the basis of the CTD's work programme prior to the Seattle Ministerial Conference. He said the proposal made by Japan to consider one issue at a time and how to move forward on them, was a useful one. A starting-point was to see whether there was work that had already been done by the CTD that could be built upon. The issue of revenue implications of trade liberalisation was one on which work had not been previously but which was nevertheless of importance. He said that questions relating to the form of the contribution made by the CTD to the General Council could be addressed later, and that the present priority was to focus on specific issues.","WTCOMTDM25.pdf","India, CTD, CTD, General, Council, CTD, General, Council, Seattle, Ministerial, Conference, CTD, CTD, Seattle, Uruguay, CTD, Seattle, Ministerial, Conference, Japan, CTD, CTD, General, Council"

The representative of Pakistan thanked the Secretariat for the Informal Note, and said his delegation associated itself extensively with the statement made by the representative of Egypt, and also that made by Morocco. Discussions regarding scope, modalities and so forth of future trade negotiations were the to be left to the General Council, and their discussion in the CTD would detract from work on developmental issues. His delegation were of the view that the list of issues identified by Egypt, and augmented by Morocco, should formulate the basis of any further work of the CTD, including in the preparation of inputs to the Third Ministerial Conference.","WTCOMTDM25.pdf","Pakistan, Secretariat, Egypt, Morocco, General, Council, CTD, Egypt, Morocco, CTD"
"1987",1987,"153","153.     The representative of the Republic of Korea said that many delegations had enumerated areas where useful work could be done. His delegation, however, was of the view that given time constraints, the CTD had to be more focused on issues concerned directly with the launch of new negotiations. He noted that some of the issues raised by the Egyptian delegation were connected to work in the General Council, and that therefore discussions needed to be held with members of the General Council. His delegation asked whether there was a distinction between the work programme of the CTD and the input of the CTD to the Third Ministerial Conference, and referred to the Informal Note, which seemed to indicate that there was some overlap between the two processes. He suggested that if indeed there was no clear distinction between the two, that the Secretariat reorganise the                                                                                     WT/COMTD/M/25                                                                                            Page 41 Informal Note in order to enable the CTD to decide which issues were more relevant as inputs to the Seattle Ministerial Conference.","WTCOMTDM25.pdf","Republic, of, Korea, CTD, General, Council, General, Council, CTD, CTD, Secretariat, CTD, Seattle, Ministerial, Conference"
"1986",1986,"152","152.    The representative of Switzerland said that the most important role of the CTD was to raise awareness of development issues on a horizontal basis. The goal of his delegation would be to provide the General Council with a broad overview of problems developing countries were facing. An alternative goal would be to provide a concrete input into the Seattle Ministerial Declaration. He said the first option was certainly valuable, though its use as an input into the Seattle Ministerial Conference was less clear. He said the proposals made, respectively, by the delegations of Egypt and Morocco, tended in the direction of a broad overview through the preparation of background documents. This would be valuable at a later stage once negotiations had begun. The present focus of the CTD was, however, to prepare and input into the Seattle Ministerial Declaration. Lengthy texts were not required, but rather concise statements to the General Council which would then be responsible for the drafting of recommendations to Ministers.","WTCOMTDM25.pdf","Switzerland, CTD, General, Council, Seattle, Seattle, Ministerial, Conference, Egypt, Morocco, CTD, Seattle, General, Council"
"1985",1985,"151","151.     The representative of Canada thanked the Secretariat for the Informal Note, and said the CTD had a constructive role to play in the preparatory process for the Third Ministerial Conference, while at the same time avoiding covering issues that fell within the mandate of the General Council. The work of the CTD should be pragmatic and advisory, to assist delegations in their search for WT/COMTD/M/25 Page 40 development friendly options. The work programme of the CTD should be based on its capacity to deliver specific advice to the General Council, and thence to the Ministerial Conference, in a manner reminiscent of its work on the Action Plan for LDCs and guidelines for WTO technical cooperation prior to the Singapore Ministerial Conference. Turning to the Informal Note, she said that the proposal to strengthen Part IV of the GATT regarding market access for manufactures and primary products of developing countries, as wells as stable and remunerative prices, needed to be examined as each agreement was negotiated in turn. She said the issue of coherence was being addressed in other fora, and notably the informal sessions of the General Council. She noted the reference in the Informal Note to a joint meeting between the WTO and the World Bank on the results of the World Bank project on supporting the participation of developing countries in the future trade negotiations. While the CTD should monitor discussions, it should not seek to take the lead on coherence issues. She said that the CTD had done much work on implementation, trade-related technical assistance and special and differential treatment. She invited the CTD to look again at these issues with a view to preparing proposals for submission to the Third Ministerial Conference. Some consideration needed to be given to the two revised papers on implementation issues, namely WT/COMTD/LDC/W10 and WT/COMTD/LDC/W/11/Rev.1. She said the CTD should adjust its work programme in order to have a CTD review, including representatives from UNCTAD, of special and differential treatment. Some of the recommendations arising from the review could then be tabled to the General Council, and thence to the Ministerial Conference. The review would cover concerns regarding market access issues and the implementation of Uruguay Round outcomes. She said a review should be undertaken of implementation issues with specific recommendations on trade-related technical assistance to be forwarded to the General Council, and thence to the Ministerial Conference. The discussion could cover the implementation of the Integrated Framework for Trade- related Technical Assistance. She said the CTD could undertake a more ambitious work programme, and could be mandated to provide advise to delegations on each agreement as it was negotiated. She said that the proposal for joint meetings between the Committee on Trade and Environment and the CTD was useful, but invited delegations to comment as the whether this was the best use of the CTD's time given the pressing need to clarify options for developing countries. The preference of her delegation was that the CTD retain a narrower focus on the emerging trade negotiations and options for developing countries.","WTCOMTDM25.pdf","Canada, Secretariat, CTD, General, Council, CTD, CTD, General, Council, LDCs, WTO, GATT, General, Council, WTO, World, Bank, World, Bank, CTD, CTD, CTD, CTD, CTD, UNCTAD, General, Council, Uruguay, General, Council, Integrated, Framework, for, Trade, CTD, Committee, on, Trade, and, Environment, CTD, CTD"
"1984",1984,"150","150.     The representative of Australia supported wholeheartedly the comments made by the representative of Egypt, and others, regarding the issues of process and modalities. She said there was considerable scope for constructive work within the CTD in preparation for the Seattle Ministerial, particularly in identifying in a concrete way some of the specific problems and concerns of developing countries. She supported the proposal made by the representative of Egypt that the study on the participation of developing countries in international trade be updated. Her delegation believed that areas in which the CTD could make a specific input into the preparatory process included the specific challenges faced by developing countries in improving participation in world trade; responses by WTO Members to these challenges; market access issues relating to products of export interest to developing countries; and the enhancement of technical assistance for capacity building. Her delegation was also of the view that the implementation of special and differential treatment could appropriately be dealt with by the CTD, though it was important to bear in mind work undertaken in the General Council. The survey on the implementation of special and differential provisions that was being carried out by the CTD was very useful in this context. Finally, her delegation wished to flag a few issues: first, follow up to the High-Level Meeting on LDCs was of utmost importance, and she noted that follow up involved an extensive work programme that went beyond the single question of market access; regarding implementation, caution was needed to avoid involvement in the work of other committees, though there could be issues of a horizontal nature that could be addressed; regarding credit for autonomous liberalisation, it remained unclear as to discussions held under the mandate of the General Council; with regard to customs revenue studies, she drew attention to the study prepared by Australia regarding the benefits of future liberalisation, which noted particularly the proportionate gains to developing countries from further liberalisation; and finally, the CTD could play a useful role in drawing attention to work conducted elsewhere such as in the World Bank or UNCTAD.","WTCOMTDM25.pdf","Australia, Egypt, CTD, Seattle, Ministerial, Egypt, CTD, WTO, Members, CTD, General, Council, CTD, General, Council, Australia, CTD, World, Bank, UNCTAD"
"1983",1983,"15","15.      The representative of Korea congratulated the organisations granted ad hoc observer status on a meeting by meeting basis. His delegation wished to make two comments. Considering the difficulties faced in granting observer status to applicants, he said that the case-by case procedure taken should be used in future. This approach was clearly referenced in General Council guidelines formulated several years before. Second, considering the difficulties faced, his delegation was of the view that the guidelines and criteria used for granting observer status should be revised. His delegation understood that the delegation of the United States had circulated proposals in the General Council for revision of these guidelines. He therefore hoped that on the basis of these and other proposals, the matter would be discussed in the General Council.","WTCOMTDM25.pdf","Korea, General, Council, United, States, General, Council, General, Council"
"1982",1982,"149","149.     The representative of Mexico agreed with the delegations of Egypt and Morocco that it was necessary to clarify the issues to be handled in the future work of the CTD, and agreed that discussions regarding the scope, modalities, etc. of negotiations came under the mandate of the General Council. He said that it was necessary to clarify the issues which the CTD would address in preparing its input to the Third Ministerial Conference and also to establish a time-frame for the submission of its work to the General Council. He said it was important to avoid that the same work be carried out on two levels, within the CTD and the General Council. To this effect, he suggested that the CTD present its contribution regarding the Third Ministerial Conference to the General Council not later than 30 September, and leave it to the General Council to work thereafter on the issues proposed. Referring to the Informal Note, he said points 1 and 2 dealt with negotiation issues, while Point 3 and thereafter dealt with the work programme of the CTD. He said the CTD already had a work programme, and discussions had been held already on a number of points mentioned in the Informal Note. While the issue of coherence between institutions and policies had not been discussed in the CTD, the General Council had conducted an analysis of the question. The role of the CTD with regard to coherence would be to stress its development aspects. Finally, with regard to the list presented by the representative of Egypt, he said that in addition to the points raised therein his delegation would also like to see discussed development aspects as well as the subject of revenues. He also noted that work was being conducted on a number of points listed by the representative of Egypt. In conclusion, he said that it needed to be established whether the CTD was to follow its work programme with a view to making an input to the Seattle Ministerial Conference by means of a contribution to the General Council by 30 September, or whether the CTD would follow its work programme and present its results in December. He said the former was the better option if the CTD was to make an input to the preparatory process.","WTCOMTDM25.pdf","Mexico, Egypt, Morocco, CTD, General, Council, CTD, General, Council, CTD, General, Council, General, Council, General, Council, CTD, CTD, CTD, General, Council, CTD, Egypt, Egypt, CTD, Seattle, General, Council, CTD, CTD"
"1981",1981,"148","148.     The representative of the European Communities agreed that the CTD was not the place to discuss the scope and modalities of future negotiations, and questions of such a nature. He said it was legitimate for the CTD to flag issues where it could make a useful contribution. Referring to the Informal Note, which covered a variety of subjects such as a possible work programme for the CTD, he said that it was important to clarify that the discussion undertaken concerned the input to the Third Ministerial Conference. He said it was not immediately clear whether the lists of subjects presented by the representatives of Morocco and Egypt were related to possible inputs to the Third Ministerial Conference or the work programme of the CTD. If the former, the representative of the European Communities said that there was much to which his delegation could agree. Regarding implementation issues specifically, he cautioned that the CTD should not get involved in work done elsewhere in other committees, though he agreed with the representative of Morocco that there may be some cross cutting issues of a horizontal nature that needed to be addressed in the CTD. The representative of the European Communities recalled that the General Council, in keeping with paragraph 8 of the Ministerial Declaration, would discuss overall implementation issues, and the CTD could contribute to those discussions. He said that, in terms of making the whole process of developing CTD inputs into the Ministerial Conference operational, it would be useful as a first stage to collect ideas, and take these back to capitals for reflection. It would then be possible, at a later stage, to present to the General Council a menu of options. He said it was important that the CTD be given some sort of guidance from the General Council as to the direction of its work, especially regarding the more political issues. He concluded by saying he did not have, at that time, any specific reactions to individual proposals made, and reiterated that the purpose of the present meeting was not to comment on issues but to collect them.

"1980",1980,"147","147.     The representative of Morocco associated himself completely with the statement made by the representative of Egypt, and particularly regarding the fact that a number of questions discussed in the informal meeting and covered in the Informal Note were best left to the General Council. He said the CTD should focus instead on a substantive and technical contribution to the Third Ministerial Conference which would allow the latter to bring out concretely the concerns of developing countries. In this respect, the representative of Morocco supported entirely the list proposed by the delegation of Egypt. He said he wished to emphasis certain issues. First he said the CTD should adopt a proactive approach to implementation issues, and try to bring out the difficulties experienced by developing countries, and in addition evaluate globally implementation by developing countries and the impact of implementation on their economies. He noted that a number of evaluations were being conducted on a sectoral basis by other committees, and by country, in other international institutions. Regarding the issue of special and differential treatment, he recalled that his delegation had proposed the holding of a seminar. The CTD should contribute to the process of implementation of special and differential provision. There should be a should be a pragmatic and practical link between the seminar and the work of the CTD. The representative of Morocco said that the follow up to the High-Level Meeting on LDCs was crucial. He said that so far the implementation of decisions taken at the High-Level Meeting was proceeding at a very slow pace and that the CTD should send a strong signal to hasten the implementation of decisions taken in favour of LDCs. The last point he wished to take up was the subject of technical cooperation. It was not possible to conceive of the integration and participation of developing countries into the WTO and the multilateral trading system with only limited technical cooperation activities, which often did not meet up to the requirements of developing countries, especially with regard to enabling them to appropriate the benefits of the multilateral trading system. Technical cooperation was a fundamental element of the work conducted by the CTD, and the latter should make a significant contribution regarding technical cooperation at the Third Ministerial Conference.","WTCOMTDM25.pdf","Morocco, Egypt, General, Council, CTD, Morocco, Egypt, CTD, CTD, CTD, Morocco, CTD, WTO, CTD"
"1979",1979,"146","146.     The representative of Egypt said that his delegation had been unable to attend the informal session, and thanked the Secretariat for the Informal Note summarising the positions taken by various delegations. His delegation felt that the direction taken by discussion was not the most appropriate. It appeared from the note that discussion had taken place on issues which were the sole responsibility of the General Council. Discussion on whether to have a Round or not, whether to adopt a single undertaking approach, discussion surrounding the modalities of negotiations, and so froth were the responsibility of the General Council. The CTD should focus on issues within its mandate to help developing countries in their preparation for the Ministerial Conference, and the mandated negotiations in various areas. His delegation proposed a number of areas in which the CTD could make a positive contribution to the Third Ministerial Conference. First, a preparation of a paper on the participation of developing countries in international trade. This paper had been prepared by the CTD on an annual basis, and the first year it had not been prepared was in 1998. The last paper produced had been WT/COMTD/W/31, in November 1997, and a constructive discussion had taken place in the CTD. A new version should consequently be produced, and should take into account the comments made by Members when the previous version had been discussed. Second, the CTD should address the issue of the distribution of benefits of the multilateral trading system on the basis of a Secretariat paper. He recalled that the Geneva Ministerial Declaration stated that Ministers agreed that more needed to be done to ensure that the worlds people shared more fully and equitably in the achievements of the multilateral trading system. Third, the Secretariat should begin analytical work on developing indicators to measure the integration of developing countries in the multilateral trading system. He noted that despite frequent references to the integration of developing countries into the multilateral trading system in meetings and in declaration, there was no clear idea of how this could be measured or evaluated. The fourth area concerned difficulties experienced by developing countries in the implementation of Uruguay Round Agreements. The Secretariat could contribute in this area by compiling difficulties experienced by developing countries, including in the area of market access for products of export interest to them. The issue of special and differential treatment had been discussed under a separate agenda item, and this was also an area where work could be undertaken. Another area of prime importance was that of technical assistance. The topic needed to be addressed to find ways and means of improving technical assistance in the WTO to address the difficulties, concerns and requirements of developing countries in regard to human and institutional capacity building. Another area was follow up to the High-Level Meeting on LDCs. The delegation of Egypt had proposed that the Secretariat prepare an analysis of market access offers made to LDCs in connections with the High Level Meeting, and examine the contribution of such offers to the trade of LDCs. Yet another area where analytical work may be required was that of credit for autonomous liberalisation. This was an important issue of which the development aspects could be usefully analysed by the CTD. Still another area of interest to developing countries was revenue implications of trade liberalisation. An analysis of this issue could be usefully addressed by the CTD. A final point, not covered in the Informal Note, was to have some relation between discussions taking place in the CTD and those taking place in the Committee on Trade and Environment. He concluded by WT/COMTD/M/25 Page 38 reiterating the view that Members should refrain from attempting to gain negotiating points in the CTD by addressing issues which were best left to the General Council.","WTCOMTDM25.pdf","Egypt, Secretariat, General, Council, General, Council, CTD, CTD, CTD, Members, CTD, Secretariat, Secretariat, Uruguay, Secretariat, WTO, Egypt, Secretariat, CTD, CTD, CTD, Committee, on, Trade, and, Environment, Members, CTD, General, Council"

Following that exchange, it had been agreed to revert to this item at the 25th Sessions, and that the Secretariat should prepare an informal note that summarised the informal consultations and that framed the discussions of the CTD on the item for the present meeting. The Secretariat had done so in its Informal Note contained in Job No. 2940, which was circulated to Members on 21 May 1999. The Chairperson hoped that Members had had the chance to consider the Informal Note by the Secretariat. She invited Members to comment on the Informal Note by the Secretariat, to exchange views on the item, and to offer suggestions on the procedure that the CTD should adopt in dealing with the item.","WTCOMTDM25.pdf","Chairperson, Members, Secretariat, CTD, Secretariat, Members, Chairperson, Members, Secretariat, Members, Secretariat, CTD"

Following the exchange of views by members, it was agreed that the Chairperson should address a letter to the Chairperson of the Committee on Budget, Finance and Administration.

"1972",1972,"14","14.      The Deputy Secretary-General of the Economic Cooperation Organisation (ECO), said it was the first time that his organisation was attending a meeting of the WTO. ECO comprised ten countries of West and Central Asia, of which six were economies in transition. It was mandated by its basic charter to pursue objectives leading to the removal of trade barriers between member states and the smooth integration of its members into the global economy. Presently, three of the ECO states – Pakistan, Turkey and the Kyrgyz Republic – were full members of the WTO. Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan and Iran had applied for WTO membership, while Tadjikistan and Turkmenistan were considering applications. Although moves towards trade liberalisation occurred at a slow pace and intra-regional trade remained modest at 7 per cent, the organisation was directing its members towards free trade and the acceptance of multilateral rules and disciplines. He said the status of Observer to the CTD, and hopefully later to the General Council, placed ECO in the mainstream of multilateral decision-making on trade, and would help ECO provide more input into intergovernmental deliberations and decisions of its members, which would in turn provide for more feedback and action by member states. It was on this understanding that the second WTO Seminar for the ECO region held in Antalya, in Turkey, envisaged a more concrete role for ECO in the provision of assistance to allow members to better accommodate trade rules whilst pursuing development objectives through trade expansion. A third joint WTO-ECO event is on the agenda of the ECO. He said that ECO believed that the Secretariats of the ECO and the WTO should cooperate closely to formulate proper ways to dismantle trade barriers and expand trade within the region. Finally, he thanked the chairperson and all Members of the CTD for inviting ECO to attend the 25th Session of the CTD.","WTCOMTDM25.pdf","Economic, Cooperation, Organisation, WTO, ECO, Central, Asia, ECO, Pakistan, Turkey, Kyrgyz, Republic, WTO, Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Iran, WTO, Tadjikistan, Turkmenistan, CTD, General, Council, ECO, ECO, Antalya, Turkey, ECO, ECO, ECO, WTO, Members, CTD, ECO, CTD"

She said that technical cooperation was essential to the integration of developing countries into the multilateral trading system. She said that it was her impression that the views of the CTD regarding the financial crisis and the need for extra technical assistance activities should be presented to the Budget Committee. If Members agreed, she would send a letter to the chairman of the Budget Committee.","WTCOMTDM25.pdf","Chairperson, Members, Director, Technical, Cooperation, Division, CTD, Budget, Committee, Members, chairman, Budget, Committee"
"1970",1970,"138","138.    The Director of the Technical Cooperation Division responded to questions raised by delegations. In response to the question by the representative for Korea, he said that the rate for Europe reflected technical assistance activities held in at the WTO Headquarters. If these activities were excluded, it could be seen that a greater number of activities were held in the Asia/Pacific than in Europe. Regarding the question raised by the representative of Egypt regarding Memoranda of Understanding with donors, he said that he did have information on the basis of responses from the 10 donors contacted in writing. Seven of these donors indicated their willingness to share information, while three others indicated their willingness to issue a background paper regarding their Memoranda of Understanding. Regarding the issue of outsourcing, he said that some activities had already been outsourced. Memoranda of Understanding were being finalised with Institute for Latin American and Caribbean Integration, the training arm of the Inter-American Development Bank, and ESCAP. A large regional seminar was to be handled by the Joint Vienna Institute at the end of June, who were also prepared to handle accommodation, transport, visas, medical insurance and other administrative concerns. Similar arrangements were being negotiated with ESCAP. Efforts were being made to coordinate the holding of short term trade policy courses, and the outsourcing of these courses. was envisioned for the future. Some types of activities, such as those requiring specialist knowledge, could probably never be outsourced, short of implementing the proposal made by the representative of Senegal for training trainers. He agreed with the representative of Norway that informal consultations should be open to all. Regarding the comments by the representative of WT/COMTD/M/25 Page 36 Switzerland that his delegation would have liked some advance indication of the budgetary situation, Mr. Léger said that a document had been circulated to the Budget Committee on 25 March 1999, indicating the situation facing the financing of technical cooperation activities. At the time, a deficit of 2 million had been projected, as compared to the current projection of 2.6 million. He would speak to the Director of the Finance and General Services Division, to examine the possibility of presenting to the Budget Committee the budgetary preoccupations surrounding technical cooperation activities. In connection with the statement made by the representative of Barbados, he said that the launch of new negotiations would mean that most of the Secretariat would be involved with the servicing of committees and working groups, the writing of papers, and so forth, thus limiting the amount of time they could devote to conducting seminars and other such activities on the field. He said that the demand for technical cooperation activities was likely to increase, while supply was likely to decrease, which made the gap even larger than at present. He did not have a solution, as yet, to this problem. The Director of the Technical Cooperation Division thanked all delegations for their comments, adding that in its next report the Secretariat would endeavour to include more details on financing as well as some paragraphs on qualitative indicators.","WTCOMTDM25.pdf","Director, Technical, Cooperation, Division, Korea, Europe, WTO, Headquarters, Europe, Egypt, Institute, for, Latin, American, and, Caribbean, Integration, Inter-American, Development, Bank, ESCAP, Joint, Vienna, Institute, ESCAP, Senegal, Norway, Switzerland, Léger, Budget, Committee, Director, Finance, General, Services, Division, Budget, Committee, Barbados, Secretariat, Director, Technical, Cooperation, Division, Secretariat"

"1967",1967,"135","135.     The representative of Barbados thanked the Director of the Technical Cooperation Division for his presentation. She said she had understood from the presentation that owing to the demands for technical assistance in connections with negotiations launched at the Seattle Ministerial, the number of missions to capitals in the year 2000 was likely to be reduced. For countries such as hers with small economies, technical cooperation needs were liable to increase exponentially with the commencement of negotiations, especially if negotiations covered issues other than those of the ""built-in agenda"". It was therefore necessary to find some very creative solutions to in order to provide increased technical cooperation activities. The outsourcing of technical cooperation activities was one such possible solution.","WTCOMTDM25.pdf","Barbados, Director, Technical, Cooperation, Division, Seattle, Ministerial"

He said his delegation had been rather taken by surprise by the gloomy budgetary situation, and added that the report should have a forward-looking chapter. Second, his delegation believed that the section on evaluation of technical assessment needed to be more concrete and provide some indicators on qualitative aspects. His delegation looked forward to with great interest to the evaluation report which was due in early in 2000. Only then would one be in a position to draw conclusions about the future orientation of the Technical cooperation Division.","WTCOMTDM25.pdf","Switzerland, Secretariat, Technical, Cooperation, Division"
"1965",1965,"133","133.     The representative of Norway thanked the Director of the Technical Cooperation Division for his presentation, and began by observing that in 1998, the WTO spent CHF7 million in technical assistance, and that this figure would increase to 9.4 million in 1999. This was a small amount of money. He said the way technical assistance had been financed in the past years had been less than satisfactory. The growth in technical assistance in recent years had been made possible by extra-budgetary funding by a small group of countries. Technical assistance was a right enjoyed by developing Members, and therefore a core activity of the WTO, and should therefore be financed through the regular budget. All Members needed to take this collective responsibility. He noted that some delegations had said that the continuous increase in technical assistance activities posed a threat to the organisation, that the WTO should not be a technical assistance organisation, and that the Secretariat should not devote an excessive amount of time to technical assistance. He said his delegation understood these concerns, and added that these should be addressed by outsourcing to other international organisations most or all technical assistance activities which did not have to be conducted by WTO staff. He recognised that there were some activities that had to be conducted by WTO. He said that the CTD had approved such an outsourcing process in its meeting in November 1998, and the Secretariat had prepared a note on its plans for outsourcing through the Task Force on Enhanced Technical Cooperation. The crux of the problem, however, lay in the fact that one could not expect other international organisations to undertake technical cooperation activities for the WTO without receiving payment. Therefore, even if as much outsourcing was done as possible, some action was needed in regard to financing. As pointed out by the Director of the Technical Cooperation Division, the Secretariat would be unable to finance technical cooperation activities as of the autumn of 1999 owing to lack of funds. The representative of Norway said that furthermore, funding from extra-budgetary sources was not a long term solution. It was a paradox that the WTO, which was in the process of preparing a new round, had to struggle with such a trivial issue. All that needed to be done was to augment the regular budget so as to fund technical assistance activities in the same manner as other activities of the Secretariat. A solution should be found by the time of the Seattle Ministerial Conference, and once a solution was found, extra-budgetary funding could be phased out. In conclusion, the representative of Norway said that the concerns of those not wishing to make the WTO a technical cooperation organisation could be addressed. This left the issue of financing, which could be resolved by increasing the regular budget. Finally, he said that the informal                                                                                    WT/COMTD/M/25                                                                                           Page 35 consultations the Director of the Technical Cooperation Division was to hold should be open to all, and not just donors, as the financing of technical cooperation was a collective responsibility.","WTCOMTDM25.pdf","Norway, Director, Technical, Cooperation, Division, WTO, Members, WTO, Members, WTO, Secretariat, WTO, WTO, CTD, Secretariat, Task, Force, on, Enhanced, Technical, Cooperation, WTO, Director, Technical, Cooperation, Division, Secretariat, Norway, WTO, Secretariat, Seattle, Ministerial, Conference, Norway, WTO, Director, Technical, Cooperation, Division"
"1964",1964,"132","132.     The representative of Egypt said that his delegation had two serious concerns. The first, as pointed out by the Director of the Technical Cooperation Division himself was the small and falling percentage of technical cooperation activities funded through the regular budget. The second concern related to the projected shortfall in financing, and he indicated that his delegation would participate in WT/COMTD/M/25 Page 34 the informal consultations held by the Director of the Technical Cooperation Division in this regard. Egypt was also concerned with the capacity of the Secretariat to deliver technical assistance. His delegation had several ideas on the matter, in relation to strengthening the Technical Cooperation Division, strengthening other Secretariat divisions responsible for the delivery of technical assistance, and addressing issues of finance and relations with other international organisations. He concluded with the following questions: first, his delegation would like a breakdown of the budget, as requested by the delegations of Morocco and the European Communities, adding that the breakdown should go back to the establishment of the WTO, in order to obtain a comparative view of developments since the establishment of the WTO to the present. This would facilitate a discussion of financial issues in the context of informal consultations. Second, page 24 of the report refered to the evaluation of technical assistance in the first quarter of the year 2000. His delegation hoped that an assessment of JITAP could take place at the same time. The third request related to the translation of basic WTO documents into Arabic. His delegation had been informed at a previous meeting by Mr. Hoda that consultations on this subject would be necessary, and the representative of Egypt requested that the Secretariat get back to his delegation regarding that point. In addition to these question, the representative of Egypt noted that, in relation to JITAP, page 32 refered to a table on budget outlays. However, this table did not appear in the document, and he requested that it be issued. With regard to page 14, which referred to conditions attached to funds provided by donors, he recalled that his delegation had previously requested information on donor conditionality, and awaited a response. Finally, the issue of outsourcing needed to be addressed, and particularly what was required on allowing the WTO to undertake outsourcing when capacity shortfalls did not allow the delivery of technical assistance.","WTCOMTDM25.pdf","Egypt, Director, Technical, Cooperation, Division, Director, Technical, Cooperation, Division, Egypt, Secretariat, Technical, Cooperation, Division, Secretariat, Morocco, WTO, WTO, JITAP, WTO, Hoda, Egypt, Secretariat, Egypt, WTO"
"1963",1963,"131","131.    The representative of Egypt thanked the Director of the Technical Cooperation Division for his presentation, and said he shared the views expressed by the delegations of Morocco and the European Communities regarding several issues. He said that when technical assistance had been reviewed in 1997, his delegation had indicated that there had been five positive elements regarding technical assistance activities in 1997. These had been: the increase in the level of technical assistance activities; increase in the level of extra-budgetary resources; increase in Africa's share of technical assistance; increased coverage of WTO agreements; and increase in activities in relation to the High-Level Meeting. A number of these observations were still valid, and his delegation welcomed the continuation of those trends. With regard to the report submitted to the CTD, he said there were again five positive elements. These were: the slight increase in budgetary outlay for technical assistance; the increase in technical missions; the use of information technologies – particularly the increased availability of training packages through the Internet; the JITAP process; and the fast pace of implementation of technical assistance activities.","WTCOMTDM25.pdf","Egypt, Director, Technical, Cooperation, Division, Morocco, Africa, WTO, CTD"

The representative of the European Communities thanked the Director of the Technical Cooperation Division for his presentation, and said he agreed with most of what had been said by the representative of Morocco. He made the following suggestions concerning the report: first, it would be useful if the budget section of the report was clearer, for instance by indicating who paid for what. This would increase transparency and may be an incentive for others to pay for more. Second, the forward-looking section was important to encourage discussion of future activities, and this section should be expanded accordingly. He said that the Task Force had more importance for future activities than was reflected in the report. There was also a strong link to the ongoing debate about coherence. He urged that this subject be dealt with in a comprehensive manner, particularly in regard to cooperation with other organisations. He noted the possibility of cooperation with other organisations that would be able to fund activities undertaken. He also suggested that it would be useful if points raised in the presentation made to the CTD could be made to the Budget Committee in order to raise awareness.","WTCOMTDM25.pdf","European, Communities, Director, Technical, Cooperation, Division, Morocco, CTD, Budget, Committee"

The representative of Morocco said he would not comment on the evaluation of technical cooperation given that his delegation had made known its views on a number of prior occasions. Addressing the issue of financing, he said that his delegation was very concerned about the financial crisis that affected technical cooperation activities. He noted that the fraction of costs covered by the regular WTO budget had been 20 per cent and 1998 and was projected at 10 per cent for 1999. His delegation supported the recommendations of the Task Force on Technical Cooperation that the funding of technical cooperation from the regular budget be increased. He said that there should be increased predictability of funding from extra-budgetary sources, as both a gesture of solidarity and a commitment on the part of the organisation as a whole.","WTCOMTDM25.pdf","Morocco, WTO"
"1959",1959,"128","128.     The representative of Morocco said that there were certain analytical aspects missing from the written report. notably regarding the budget and the distribution of expenditure. The approach that had been adopted on the basis of the number of activities provided an approximate indication of the value of the activity, but a budgetary breakdown would provide a clear indication of the value of activities, as well as an indication of the distribution of resources, thus enabling an identification of priorities, on a thematic basis. The next report should have a section dealing with coordination and cooperation with other competent agencies. The approach adopted in the report reflected in a fragmented fashion the question of cooperation and coordination. A more integrated section would provide a clearer indication of the approach followed by the Secretariat in the sphere of coordination and cooperation with other agencies.","WTCOMTDM25.pdf","Morocco, Secretariat"
"1958",1958,"127","127.      The representative of Morocco thanked the Director of the Technical Cooperation Division for his presentation, which filled in some of the gaps left in the written report. His delegation were pleased to note the increase, by about a third, in activities from 1997 to 1998, and wished to see this trend continue. His delegation reiterated the importance it accorded to the technical cooperation activities of the WTO, which should accompany in an effective way all the activities of the organisation, and which should keep pace with the evolution of the multilateral trading system. His delegation reiterated the importance it accorded to the Integrated Framework for trade-related technical assistance, and noted with regret delays in its implementation, particularly with respect to the convening of round table meetings. Without such meetings, decisions taken at the High-Level Meeting would remain ineffectual. He also reiterated the importance of the JITAP process, and said that it should be extended to other African countries.

The representative of the Republic of Korea thanked the Director of the Technical Cooperation Division for his presentation, and referred to paragraph 85 which detailed technical cooperation activities by region. The representative of Korea wished to know what factors explained the difference between the growth rates in technical cooperation activities held in the Asia-Pacific region and those held in Europe, given that there were more developing countries in Asia than in Europe.","WTCOMTDM25.pdf","Republic, of, Korea, Director, Technical, Cooperation, Division, Korea, Asia-Pacific, Europe, Asia, Europe"
"1956",1956,"125","125.     The Director of the Technical Cooperation Division said that the future orientation of technical cooperation could be dealt with under three sub-headings. First, the question of funding OF activities. As indicated previously, 90 per cent of current financial requirements were met through extra-budgetary resources, making it extremely difficult for the WTO to efficiently plan technical cooperation activities. The regular WTO budget for technical cooperation needed urgently to be revisited, if technical cooperation was to continue. Second, it was necessary to identify possibilities for outsourcing. In this context the task force on enhanced WTO technical cooperation circulated recently to Members identified possibilities. Areas where WTO expertise could be supplemented included intellectual property rights (WIPO), customs matters (WCO), TBT (ISO), SPS (Codex), preparations for post-Seattle negotiations (the World Bank); trade and investment and trade and competition (UNCTAD), training information technology (ITC). The paper also identified a number of organisations at the regional level, including UN regional commissions, the Joint Vienna Institute, with which memoranda of understanding could be negotiated. Finally, the elaboration of multi-year programmes of interest to developing countries would permit a more structured approach to technical assistance, but was dependent on a strengthened regular budget. What could be anticipated as priorities were overview of WTO agreements, followed by an upgrading of human capacity to enable better participation in the WTO, and finally specialised knowledge to enable the implementation of WTO agreements.","WTCOMTDM25.pdf","Director, Technical, Cooperation, Division, WTO, WTO, WTO, Members, WTO, WIPO, WCO, TBT, Codex, World, Bank, UNCTAD, ITC, UN, Joint, Vienna, Institute, WTO, WTO, WTO"
"1955",1955,"124","124.     The Director of the Technical Cooperation Division said that the current problem lay in the fact that because it was not known in advance what funds would be available for a particular year, the approach that was followed was one of first-come, first-served, though efforts were made, to the extent that was possible, to consolidate requests into regional seminars. Ad hoc requests received amounted to 57, at a cost of CHF947,000. TPR reviews accounted for CHF500,000. Additional funding was for TPR reviews of least-developed countries, notably Chad, Mozambique and Mauritania, as well as Malawi, Central African Republic and Madagascar. Regarding short term trade policy courses, the task force report on enhanced technical cooperation called for eight short-term trade policy courses. The estimate in the budget provided for four at CHF150,000 apiece. The final result of the technical assistance budget for 1999 was a projected deficit of CHF2.6 million. He indicated his intention to call an informal meeting with donors to evaluate the current situation, and to see whether a positive response could be elicited to this situation.","WTCOMTDM25.pdf","Director, Technical, Cooperation, Division, TPR, TPR, Chad, Mozambique, Mauritania, Malawi, Central, African, Republic, Madagascar"
"1954",1954,"123","123.     The Director of the Technical Cooperation Division presented the budget situation as of May 1999. The figures presented excluded the regular training courses of three months each amounting to CHF1.5 million. They also excluded donations from the United Kingdom for the consolidated tariffs schedule database, and for the financing of one position for one year in the Technical Cooperation Division to cover technical evaluation. His presentation assumed the disbursement of 1999 instalments yet to be disbursed by donors. He drew attention to the fact that the line ""WTO regular budget"" could only be used to cover travel and per diem expenses of WTO staff members. The regular budget, along with programme support fund, and the trust fund donations of CHF5.2 million for gave a total funding of CHF6.775 million. It could be seen therefore that roughly 10 per cent of technical cooperation activities were projected to be financed through the regular WTO budget. Regarding projected expenditure, close to 60 per cent of projected expenditures had been firmly committed. A number of reasons for this development could be posited, including the upcoming deadlines for the implementation of several agreements, the carryover of a number of activities from 1998, the extension of WTO reference centre programmes to small island economies, increasing requests for TBT and SPS seminars, general concerns related to the Singapore work programme, and preparations for the forthcoming Seattle Ministerial. Some request for regional WT/COMTD/M/25 Page 32 seminars had already been refused: one was on trade and development for middle-eastern countries, in Malta; one was for-English speaking LDCs on rules, in Malawi; and so forth.","WTCOMTDM25.pdf","Director, Technical, Cooperation, Division, United, Kingdom, WTO, WTO, WTO, WTO, TBT, SPS, Singapore, Seattle, Ministerial, Malta, Malawi"
"1953",1953,"122","122.     With regard to the Integrated Framework, Mr. Léger drew attention to the input of the WTO. In 1998, 52 activities were held, 32 of which consisted in the establishment of national reference centres, seven national seminars, three meetings of the inter-agency working group, three meeting in the Round Table process, three regional seminars (one in Zambia for English-speaking African LDCs, one in Djibouti for French-speaking African LDCs, and one in Bangladesh for Asian and Pacific LDCs), and two short term policy courses for LDCs. Regarding the WTO contribution to the JITAP programme, there had been 23 missions, mostly concerning sessions on notification, implementation issues and the establishment of WTO reference centres.","WTCOMTDM25.pdf","Integrated, Framework, Léger, WTO, Zambia, Djibouti, Bangladesh, WTO, WTO"
"1952",1952,"121","121.    The Director of the Technical Cooperation Division said that in keeping with the Singapore Ministerial Declaration, the services of the division had been made available to developing country Members in the areas of trade and competition policy, and trade and investment. These activities had been conducted in connection with the UNCTAD and the World Bank,. there had also been a symposium on trade facilitation in 1998, and a number of missions had been conducted on transparency in government procurement. Lastly consultation with other international organisations covered JITAP and the Integrated Framework. The WTO was also in contact with a number of other agencies with a view to develop joint programmes.","WTCOMTDM25.pdf","Director, Technical, Cooperation, Division, Singapore, Members, UNCTAD, World, Bank, Integrated, Framework, WTO"
"1951",1951,"120","120.     Technical aspects of the scheduling of commitments were also dealt with in the course of technical assistance activities. Activities on TRIPS reflected the implementation date of the agreement in January 2000, and also the joint programme conducted with the WIPO. Activities under Dispute Settlement Understanding numbered 17, of which four were regional or sub-regional courses, while the others were at the national level. Activities under trade and environment reflected the holding of regional and sub-regional seminars announced in 1997 by the WTO. Regarding implementation issues, a number of requests had been made for legal advisors to screen national legislation to verify compliance with WTO agreements. Regarding notification requirements, specific seminars had been held. Regional integration was also a subject of increasing interest to developing countries, particularly those involved in negotiations on a regional, sub-regional or bilateral basis. Attention was given to the issue of consistency between regional, sub-regional and bilateral arrangements with WTO commitments. One activity had been held under the rubric of electronic commerce, though more were expected in the near future. There was interest in the role of electronic commerce within the WTO framework, as well as progress to date made on the work programme on electronic commerce.","WTCOMTDM25.pdf","WIPO, WTO, WTO, WTO, WTO"

"1949",1949,"119","119.     The Director of the Technical Cooperation Division noted that the activities of the Division covered a number of subjects, which could be classified into 11 categories, including general seminars; goods; services; dispute settlement; intellectual property; trade and environment; implementation issues; regionalism; electronic commerce; and so forth. General seminars were defined as those where general dissemination of the WTO and its agreements took place. The number of activities under general seminars in 1998 numbered 80, reflecting a heightened interest in the activities of the WTO and the multilateral trading system. Activities on specific subjects were covered usually in workshops, specific seminars and technical missions. The total number of activities was greater than the total number of missions, given that in any one mission, it was possible that more than one activity be covered. Missions on accession reflected the increased demand for technical cooperation by countries in the process of accession to the WTO. The number of activities under information technologies for development, 37, reflected the installation of WTO reference centres. Activities on market access were mainly on the explanation and identification of market access conditions at the product and tariff line levels, and incorporated two training courses on trade negotiations skills. The large number of missions on customs valuation reflected the implementation date of the agreement by the year 2000. A number of countries in 1998 required assistance on the transposition of tariff schedules into the HS 1996 system. For reasons of cost efficiency, the Integrated Data Base had been dealt with in seminars on market access issues. Agriculture, textiles and clothing were important subjects for developing countries, and SPS and TBT were treated together in one single activity. In the area of rules, it was noteworthy that more requests for assistance were being received by the Secretariat. This was an area where the division concerned devoted a sizeable amount of time to technical assistance at headquarters, responding to daily questions and concerns by delegations. As already indicated, servicing committees and working groups, along with dispute settlement panels, constituted the priority area of work for the Secretariat in this domain. The main subject that was beginning to be covered substantially in technical assistance was the Agreement on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures. Particular attention was given to the issue of disciplines in notification requirements. In the area of trade in services, the                                                                                   WT/COMTD/M/25                                                                                          Page 31 Agreement was explained in general, as well as at the sectoral level, particularly with respect to financial services and telecommunications.","WTCOMTDM25.pdf","Director, Technical, Cooperation, Division, WTO, WTO, WTO, WTO, Integrated, Data, Base, SPS, TBT, Secretariat, Secretariat"
"1948",1948,"118","118.    Mr. Léger said that of the 140 activities fully organised by the WTO (which represented less than 50 per cent of all activities in which the WTO was involved), over half were undertaken by divisions other than the Technical Cooperation Division, though the latter acted as coordinator. By ""other institutions"" was meant those that were part of the JITAP process, those that were part of the Integrated Framework, and others. Activities to which the WTO was invited numbered 110, representing more than one-third of all activities in 1998. In a number of cases, costs – transportation costs and local expenses - were frequently borne by the WTO, and more was being done to have host organisations absorb these costs in the future.","WTCOMTDM25.pdf","Léger, WTO, WTO, Technical, Cooperation, Division, Integrated, Framework, WTO, WTO"
"1947",1947,"117","117.     Mr. Léger added that two-thirds of all planned missions assigned for 1998 under the three-year plan were executed, compared to 50 per cent in 1997. However, activities coming under the three-year plan constituted only a third of all activities conducted in 1998. Although the three-year plan was of help, more rigorous planning was required by members. The number of activities not coming under the three-year plan (196) was in part explained by the fact that this was the first full year of operation of the three-year plan. Finally, the activities of the three-year plan not executed (58) were due to cancellation by host countries, or postponement for a variety of reasons. It needed to be made clear that many actors were involved in the conduct of a technical cooperation mission: the Technical Cooperation Division as the chief executing unit, the host country, funding resources, and in the case of the regional seminar, the beneficiary countries. The interaction between these various actors was an important factor in the cancellation or postponement of activities.","WTCOMTDM25.pdf","Léger, Technical, Cooperation, Division"
"1946",1946,"116","116.     The Director of the Technical Cooperation Division said that whenever modes of delivery were discussed, attention needed to be given to the evolving nature of the multilateral rules based system, and in this context the need for at least three levels of activities. The first level consisted of the general dissemination of an overview of the WTO and its agreements. The second level represented more in depth upgrading of developing countries human resource skills in order to further improve their capacity to participate in the WTO and the decision-making process. The third level consisted of specialised knowledge required for the implementation of WTO agreements. Examples in this respect included the training of customs officials in customs evaluation methods, establishing enquiry points and conformity assessment procedures as required by the TBT, and risk assessment techniques under the SPS. It was also important to bear in mind that there was a continuous renewal in developing country administrations, with new government officials, thereby requiring repeats of WTO training programmes. Looking specifically at the figures, there had been an increase in regional seminars from 42 to 71, and a decrease in national seminars from 44 to 41. These results were in line with Members' requests to emphasise regional seminars. Although regional seminars reach a larger number of countries and permit the establishment of contacts with the authorities of participating countries, the cost of regional seminars was very much higher than the cost of national seminars. The cost of an average regional seminar in 1998 was CHF150,000, while the cost of the average national seminar was CHF20,000. Furthermore, the synergy that resulted from regional seminars was usually limited owing to the small number of national participants. Given that developing countries were increasingly concerned with implementation issues, it was likely that the number of national seminars would increase. National seminars served to identify more readily concerns at the country level, and the larger number of participants ensured a greater synergy once the activity had been completed and facilitated the assessment of the implications of agreements. The huge increase in technical seminars from 55 to 90 reflected the establishment of WTO reference centres, and also resulted from specific WT/COMTD/M/25 Page 30 request from Members to conduct specialized activities rather than general ones. The increase in workshops and symposia from 78 to 106 denoted the fact that the WTO had been increasingly in demand to participate in these events.","WTCOMTDM25.pdf","Director, Technical, Cooperation, Division, WTO, WTO, WTO, TBT, WTO, Members, WTO, Members, WTO"
"1945",1945,"115","115.     Mr. Léger presented information on the geographic distribution of technical assistance activities for 1998, and noted that Africa continued to account for the largest number of activities. The 58 per cent increase in 1998 over 1997 resulted from activities under the Integrated Framework and JITAP, and also from the decision to establish WTO reference centres in LDCs. The numbers for Europe for both 1997 and 1998 were inflated insofar as they included all activities that took place at WTO headquarters, which activities covered developing countries in all regions. He said that the footnote pertaining to North America referred to short term trade policy courses that were geared to developing and least developed countries, that took place in Washington D.C., and that were financed by the Organisation of American States. Insofar as the Middle East was concerned, the increase was closer to 50 per cent, reflecting greater involvement of countries in this area of the globe, and also because there were a number of countries in the process of accession in this area. The WTO worked closely in the Middle East with the Islamic Development Bank, which had financed a number of activities.","WTCOMTDM25.pdf","Léger, Africa, WTO, Europe, WTO, North, America, Washington, D.C., Organisation, of, American, States, Middle, East, WTO, Middle, East, Islamic, Development, Bank"
"1944",1944,"114","114.     The Director of the Technical Cooperation Division said the purpose of his presentation was to give a review of the technical cooperation activities that took place in 1998, and also the budget situation, as of 31 of May 1999, for the year 1999. There had been a fourfold increase in the number of technical cooperation activities between 1995 and 1998. In the first five months of 1999, 141 activities had been conducted. This rate of increase was not sustainable, owing to financial and human resource constraints. Furthermore, the preparations for the Seattle Ministerial Conference, and the ensuing negotiations, would require that WTO would have to be present in Geneva to service these negotiations. He also recalled that the workload of operational divisions consisted primarily in servicing working groups and committees; dealing with dispute settlement panels; providing day to day technical assistance to delegations in Geneva; and only when time and resources permitted the undertaking of technical assistance missions outside Geneva.","WTCOMTDM25.pdf","Director, Technical, Cooperation, Division, Seattle, Ministerial, Conference, WTO, Geneva, Geneva, Geneva"

"1941",1941,"111","111.     Mr. Geoffroy of the Integrated Framework Administrative Unit briefly presented the Integrated Framework website. He said the website had been prepared with very simple graphics, so as to facilitate the downloading of information in LDCs. The site became operational in September 1998, and had received almost 9,000 hits at an average of 50 hits a day. The upper left part of the front page contained the main menu, while the core information on the process for every single LDC was contained under the heading ""Country-Specific Programmes"". Once a participating country had been selected, a full menu was accessible with rubrics such as the national focal point, needs assessment and so forth. The national focal point was normally a senior official within a relevant Ministry of the LDC. The needs assessment paper contained the country's economic analysis covering all trade development constraints and identified the technical assistance needs. The integrated response page was divided into three columns; the left column stating the technical assistance needs listed in the needs assessment page, the middle column gaving the name of the core agency meeting the need identified, and the right hand column briefly describing the response of the core agency. The Status of Implementation page reflected the status of implementation in the LDC. Updating of the report on implementation was made regularly by the agencies every 6-8 months and communicated to the Administrative Unit for its electronic dissemination.              The page on communication by other development partners listed the trade-related assistance the country was receiving from other multilateral partners and bilateral agencies. The page ""Status of Preparation of Round Tables"" provided information on the timing of the meeting, the venue and the lead agency assisting the country in preparing for the event. The Round Table document was disseminated in advance to all interested parties in real time through the website. Returning to the main menu, the page ""programme participants"" provided information on the main group of actors, that is the LDCs, the six core agencies, and other development partners. The page ""core group of organisations"" made available information on six core agencies. The section ""other development partners"" contained information on multilateral and bilateral partners. Under the multilaterals sub-heading, information on 12 agencies active in trade-related technical assistance to LDCs was presented. Under the heading Inter-Agency Group, the coordinates of the focal points of the six core agencies was provided. Under the heading official document, a selection of the most important Integrated Framework documents was provided, and under the headings ""process at a glance"", ""coming events"" and ""what's new?"", information on the most important steps for participating LDCs was provided in a summarised way.","WTCOMTDM25.pdf","Geoffroy, Integrated, Framework, Administrative, Unit, Administrative, Unit, Inter-Agency, Group, Integrated, Framework"
"1940",1940,"110","110.    Mr. Dagata said that another measure of progress was what the six core agencies had accomplished in carrying out their respective parts of the integrated responses. Agencies had already addressed almost half of the 2,000 needs they agreed to pursue in the Integrated Responses. These responses typically included IMF missions to review and update customs legislation, ITC buyers-sellers meetings, UNCTAD consultancies on trade policy issues, World Bank advisory missions to improve national frameworks, and WTO specialised national and regional workshops. Progress had also been made in reducing the overlap and fostering synergies among core agencies. Several of the integrated responses were joint responses involving two or more agencies. Less tangibly, the Integrated Framework had also sensitised partners to the importance of trade-related assistance, and had given it more visibility on the development agenda. this was resulting in enhanced effectiveness in the delivery of technical assistance. All of this would be considered in an eventual evaluation of the value-added of the Integrated Framework approach.","WTCOMTDM25.pdf","Dagata, IMF, ITC, UNCTAD, World, Bank, WTO, Integrated, Framework, Integrated, Framework"

The Chairperson therefore proposed that the CTD should invite WIPO and ECOWAS to participate at this meeting as observers on an ad hoc basis and that the CTD agree to invite to its next meeting on an ad hoc and on a meeting-by-meeting basis the 11 following IGOs:         (i)      Arab Maghreb Union;         (ii)     Economic Community of West Africa States (ECOWAS);         (iii)    Economic Cooperation Organization (ECO);         (iv)     Inter-Arab Investment Guarantee Corporation;         (v)      Islamic Development Bank (IDB);         (vi)     Organization of African Unity (OAU);         (vii)    Organization of the Islamic Conference (OIC);         (viii)   South Centre;         (ix)     South Pacific Forum (SPF);         (x)      West African Economic and Monetary Union (WAEMU); and         (xi)     World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO)","WTCOMTDM25.pdf","Chairperson, CTD, WIPO, ECOWAS, CTD, West, Africa, States, ECOWAS, Economic, Cooperation, Organization, Inter-Arab, Investment, Guarantee, Corporation, Islamic, Development, Bank, Organization, of, African, Unity, OAU, OIC, South, Centre, South, Pacific, West, African, Economic, and, Monetary, Union, WAEMU, World, Intellectual, Property, Organization, WIPO"
"1938",1938,"109","109.    So far, 40 needs assessments and the corresponding Integrated Responses had been prepared. Over 20 countries were planning for a trade-related Round Table and were in various stages of preparation. One Round Table had been held in December 1998 in Uganda. It had become clear that the round table process was not moving as quickly initially expected. Accordingly, the Administrative Unit was asked early this year to develop a model Round Table document, which had now been disseminated to all LDCs. Without compromising ownership, the agencies were now taking a more proactive approach to getting round tables set up, including facilitating launch workshops and the national preparation of round table documents. Thirteen Round Table Meetings were currently scheduled for 1999, though this was understandably subject to change. In Angola, preparations were at an early stage, and the UNDP was helping. In Bangladesh, the World Bank was helping to organise a launch workshop in Dhaka on 23 June 1999. The next meeting of the Inter-Agency Working Group was also scheduled to be held in Dhaka after the workshop. In Bhutan, help in preparing the meeting was principally from UNDP and ITC. In Djibouti, following preparatory missions by the WTO, the UNCTAD and the ITC, the Round Table Meeting could take place in the autumn. In Ethiopia, a Round Table document had been circulated; the World Bank was providing support. In Gambia, the meeting would take place within a broader UNDP-supported meeting, also focussing on private sector development and agriculture. In Guinea, the meeting was planned in conjunction with a meeting on private sector development. A joint mission of the Bank, the UNCTAD and the UNDP would help prepare it. In Haiti, consultants under a UNDP/UNCTAD project were helping to prepare documentation. In Mozambique, preparations were still at an early stage. Nepal would also attend the launch workshop in Dhaka. In Niger, a broader UNDP Round Table would include discussions on the trade sector and private sector development. In Tanzania, a meeting was being pursued with the support of the World Bank, following recommendations of a consultative group meeting in may. In Zambia, discussion was under way with core agencies. Finally, there was interest in having a meeting in Malawi.

"1937",1937,"108","108.     Mr. Dagata proceeded to introduce the Integrated Framework. The Integrated Framework for trade-related technical assistance to LDCs was endorsed by the October 1997 High-Level Meeting on LDCs. The core agencies were the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank, the UNDP, and the three Geneva institutions. They formed an interagency working group, under the chairmanship of the WTO, supported by the Administrative Unit housed at the ITC. Other multilateral and bilateral partners active in trade-related assistance were now participating the Integrated Framework process to arrive at a truly comprehensive, cooperation framework. The 48 least-developed countries were heavily concentrated in Africa, but there were a large number in Asia as well. A website - LDCS.ORG – supported the IF process. The site was a key and unique information tool providing transparency for the process. The starting-point of the IF process was the country's needs assessment. The core agencies addressed those needs in an integrated response. Other multilateral and bilateral agencies had been invited to broaden the integrated response, and several had done so. Subsequently, the LDC should schedule a trade-related Round Table meeting, where it presented in a strategic setting, its needs assessment , the integrated response, and requested assistance. At the meeting, development partners should officially announce their interest in supporting elements of a multi-year country-specific programme of trade-related assistance.","WTCOMTDM25.pdf","Dagata, International, Monetary, Fund, World, Bank, UNDP, Geneva, WTO, ITC, Africa, Asia, LDC"
"1936",1936,"107","107.     Mr. Dagata concluded by reviewing the key characteristics of the JITAP as compared with the Integrated Framework for LDCs. JITAP was a distinctive, concrete programme of assistance while the Integrated Framework was mainly a structure and a set of processes to co-ordinate assistance, although it did lead to a coordinated group of activities. JITAP was at present an Africa programme, while the Integrated Framework covered the world. JITAP covered both LDCs and non-LDCs in Africa while the Integrated Framework was by definition restricted to LDCs. The three Geneva institutions were currently the only JITAP executing agencies, and they also participated in the integrated framework with other core agencies. There were four JITAP LDCs which also fell within the scope of the Integrated Framework.","WTCOMTDM25.pdf","Dagata, Integrated, Framework, for, LDCs, Africa, Integrated, Framework, Africa, Geneva, Integrated, Framework"
"1935",1935,"106","106.     Mr. Ben Fadhl said that the JITAP was quite complex, given the large number of players and the heavy information flows generated by programme partners and network of trainers. The problem was compounded by numerous communication difficulties and high operating costs. These challenges had to be overcome by networking and using modern communication technologies, to create a tool for management and information exchange, that can be used readily by all parties concerned, and this was the Communication and Discussion Facility (CDF). The CDF had four modules: the exchange of documents module, which provided access to information by JITAP partners; the question-answers module, which enabled any participating user to raise a question on the web site and have a reply by an appropriate resource person; the online discussion module, which was a JITAP chat-room where day-to-day technical issues were discussed; and the newsgroup module, where JITAP teams periodically initiated thematic discussions or exchanged ideas on selected subjects. The address was JITAP.ORG. Once the home page was reached, one would have the choice of surfing in French or English, though at the moment the prototype operated only in English. Once one had entered the CDF, one could choose between functions that were grouped in four sections: key information dealt with the programme and participating countries; CDF modules - the already mentioned; links to relevant sites; and utilities. If one visited ""key information"" a number of documents which could be reviewed or downloaded were available for each country. The visitor of JITAP.ORG could review the implementation plan for that country, obtain a list of National Steering Committee members and their contact addresses, and so forth. It was possible to examine information under implementation under various clusters. The question and answer module enabled to post a question or review answers given. The module on documents exchange allowed the transmission of documents electronically, rather than faxing them or sending them by courier.                                                                                   WT/COMTD/M/25                                                                                          Page 27","WTCOMTDM25.pdf","Ben, Fadhl, CDF, JITAP, JITAP, CDF, National, Steering, Committee"
"1934",1934,"105","105.    Mr. Vijay said that work done by the ITC under the cluster relating to trade analysis provided inputs to the cluster dealing with the impact of the multilateral trading system on the national economy, which provided a key input to the national symposium in the field, in which all parties were involved to identify strategic trade options. Revised trade policies in line with WTO rules were developed in order to create an enabling environment in which enterprises could flourish and help in formulating appropriate sector strategies, which then provided an input into the strategies and business plans of the enterprises which were actually involved in exporting. JITAP generated information both of a qualitative and quantitative nature on a massive scale. To ensure that synergistic benefits accrued in a cumulative manner and valuable lessons learnt by some participants were readily available to all when needed, an innovative Internet-based communication and discussion facility was to be set up under JITAP. Mr. Vijay handed the floor to Mr. Ben Fadhl to present this facility.","WTCOMTDM25.pdf","Vijay, ITC, WTO, JITAP, Vijay, Ben, Fadhl"
"1933",1933,"104","104.    Mr. Vijay said that taken together, all clusters and families gave simultaneous and sequential actions at three levels in order to achieve the three objectives of the programme. The capacity developed under the three families was sustained by the work done under the fourth family – support family – where each of the three organisations namely the ITC, the WTO, and the UNCTAD, were involved. The fourth family acted as a backbone for supporting the entire programme which derived its main synergy benefit from it. There were links between clusters. For instance, work done in the export supply and market potential cluster was used in the cluster dealing with sector/product strategy. This was an example of links between clusters of the same family. However, there were many linkages between clusters belonging to different families. For instance, work done under the export supply and market potential cluster fed directly into the cluster dealing with the impact of the multilateral trading system on the national economy, which in turn provided inputs into the sector/product strategy cluster. Likewise, work done under the cluster ""adjustment to trade laws and regulations"" informed tasks undertaken under the impact of the multilateral trading system on the national economy and vice versa.","WTCOMTDM25.pdf","Vijay, ITC, WTO"
"1932",1932,"103","103.    The fourth family provided the support to ensure that the capacity built under the other three families is maintained even after the programme came to an end. This family also had four clusters. The ""programme management"" cluster had a number of activities undertaken to ensure that various components of the programme were synchronised and activities and outputs were delivered jointly in a timely manner in accordance with the programme plan. The ""reference centre"" cluster ensured that up to date technical information on the multilateral trading system was readily available to various users such as government ministries, national institutions, and private sector enterprises. The cluster that dealt with networking of partners facilitated the smooth flow of information among programme partners on JITAP's various components using the latest technology tools; and in the human resource development/capacity building cluster activities were aimed at ensuring that appropriate training WT/COMTD/M/25 Page 26 material is developed and made available to all users, and that required skills are developed in the concerned institutions.","WTCOMTDM25.pdf","JITAP"
"1931",1931,"102","102.     The third family dealt with enhancing the export readiness of enterprises. It was, by the nature of work that needed to be done, a large family. It sought to lay the foundation for development of exports from a country and to give practical help at the enterprise level. To understand the third family, it was best to see it as comprising two components. The first dealt with providing support at the strategic level while the second dealt with building capacity at the operational level, so that enterprises actually involved in exporting goods and services could compete effectively in the rapidly globalizing world economy. The strategic component itself had three clusters. Under the first cluster, export supply and market potential, the trade prospects of counties were analysed on the basis of their national export performance and the evaluation of international demand and supply. Under the second cluster, training for strategy formulation, countries received help in order to identify for themselves products that could be exported and markets in which they could be sold. Under the third cluster, sectoral strategies were prepared for the main export subsectors and product groups, and technical advice was to be given to exporting enterprises to enable them to define company-specific business strategies and plans. At the operational level, work was undertaken in four clusters. In the first two clusters, namely trade information, national enquiry points and quality management, support was given to create an enabling environment for the enterprise to operate so that they have access to necessary business infrastructure to conduct their business efficiently and effectively. Under the last two clusters, namely trade secrets and export financing, efforts were directed at the enterprises themselves giving them support in areas of critical importance, in for instance, how to approach export markets and finance their export activity, negotiate with banks and so forth.","WTCOMTDM25.pdf",""
"1930",1930,"101","101.     The second family addressed the issue of adjusting the national trade legislation so that it conformed to the multilateral trading system and regulations, and also had two clusters. Under the first of these, technical assistance was given on all matters relating to customs, while under the second, assistance was given for adjusting the legal framework of a country's external trade so that it was in line with the rules of the multilateral trading system.","WTCOMTDM25.pdf",""
"1929",1929,"100","100.     The first family of clusters was aimed at strengthening the capacity of countries to understanding the multilateral trading system amd its implications for external trade. The essence of the activities in this family was to help countries in comprehending the emerging trading environment and to define the field in which businesses truly operated. Within the first family, there were two clusters: the first dealt with developing a knowledge of the multilateral trading system and its implications while the second dealt with the impact of the multilateral trading system on the national economy and adaptation of external trade policy.","WTCOMTDM25.pdf",""
"1928",1928,"10","10.     The Chairperson recalled that at the previous Session of the CTD, the Committee agreed to accord ad hoc observer status on a meeting-by-meeting basis to nine Intergovernmental Organizations (IGOs). Since that decision, the Committee had received two more applications for observer status in the Committee, from the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) and the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS); these applications had been circulated to Members on 15 March 1999. The chairperson had consulted with Members on the two applications on 1April 1999, and it was understood that these two IGOs should, beginning with the CTD's 25th Session, also be accorded ad hoc observer status on a meeting-by-meeting basis. Pursuant to the understanding by Members on 1 April 1999, (WIPO) and ECOWAS had been invited to this meeting.","WTCOMTDM25.pdf","Chairperson, CTD, Committee, Intergovernmental, Organizations, Committee, Committee, World, Intellectual, Property, Organization, WIPO, Economic, Community, of, West, ECOWAS, Members, Members, CTD, Members, WIPO, ECOWAS"

He said that there were difficulties in evaluating joint programmes, which at the moment tended not be evaluated at all. He recalled that his delegation had been requesting an evaluation of the Integrated Framework for the last two years, and the question had arisen as to whether technical assistance should be requested under a programme that had never been evaluated. The representative of Egypt recalled his delegation's request for information on conditions attached to donor funds provided to the technical assistance budget, and hoped the Director of the Technical Cooperation Division could provide some information on this. His delegation also wished to know whether the possibility existed for translating WTO documentation into Arabic, and how this could be financed and what procedures should be followed. Finally, he said his delegation did not believe that the CTD needed to endorse the questionnaires for the evaluation of technical assistance. Hence the Secretariat should proceed in using them, while keeping the CTD informed of any modifications made.","WTCOMTDM24.pdf","Egypt, Secretariat, Integrated, Framework, Egypt, Director, WTO, CTD, Secretariat, CTD"

"1919",1919,"96","96.      The representative of New Zealand joined the delegations of Norway and the European Communities in supporting the questionnaires and their use, starting in July, adding that the questionnaires satisfied the criteria of simplicity, transparency, objectivity and practicality. She said that while evaluation was not in itself adequate to ensure good technical assistance, the questionnaires were an effective tool in gauging whether the pitch of WTO technical assistance was at the right level for the participants involved. This would be an important first step in ensuring that technical assistance programmes continue to be effective. Her delegation welcomed the section in the questionnaire regarding the identification of follow up activities, since it was likely that an individual seminar would highlight the need for further concrete technical assistance. With reference to Section V of the document concerning actions undertaken jointly by the WTO and others agencies, her delegation held the view that, although there was a need to distinguish WTO performance from that of other agencies, the general forms of evaluation as set out in the questionnaires could still be useful in the assessment of some joint activities. Suitable modifications could be made, the questionnaires would not need to be strictly audited or form part of the overall evaluation report, but could nevertheless be a useful instrument in ensuring the success of joint technical assistance activities.","WTCOMTDM24.pdf","New, Zealand, Norway, WTO, WTO, WTO"

He agreed with the representative of Egypt in underlining the usefulness of Trade Policy Course, which proved to be very popular amongst developing countries. He said that technical assistance delivered by WTO consultants and experts through short term seminars and symposia in developing countries had a limited impact when compared with the benefits received by participants from a three-four month course at the Secretariat headquarters. Given that the WTO agreements were not widely understood in Pakistan, and the need to train both government officials and private sector actors, he raised the possibility of increasing the length of visits by WTO experts and consultants to developing countries to a period of one month, to enhance the impact of the interaction between experts and recipients of technical assistance.","WTCOMTDM24.pdf","Pakistan, Secretariat, Egypt, WTO, Secretariat, WTO, Pakistan, WTO"
"1917",1917,"94","94.     The representative of the European Communities noted that the document rightly related to the evaluation of technical assistance provided by the WTO Secretariat only, and did not cover all the                                                                                      WT/COMTD/M/24                                                                                             Page 15 other integrated activities. She wished to know whether she was correct in assuming that the contents of the document provided the basis, if approved, for a first report, probably by early 2000, following which the CTD would then consider how to proceed with more in depth evaluation. She also requested that the Secretariat elaborate on how it intended to incorporate responses to questionnaires into a feedback process as referred to in paragraph 2 of the document. Concerning the questionnaires themselves, and the country form, she said it would be useful to add a box entitled ""Success Indicators and Performance Targets"", in order to measure results against targets. She also drew the attention of the meeting to questions 6(a) and 6(b) of the feedback form noting that two sets of responses were necessary. She said her delegation would be interested to hear about the work of the task force on technical cooperation and the follow up to the Deputy Director-General's report. Finally, her delegation supported the suggestion made by Norway that the Secretariat use the tools already available to start the evaluation process, while remaining open to making adjustments as needed.","WTCOMTDM24.pdf","European, Communities, WTO, Secretariat, CTD, Secretariat, Director-General, Norway, Secretariat"
"1916",1916,"93","93.      The representative of Norway thanked the Secretariat for preparing the note on evaluating WTO technical assistance, and the two evaluation forms. Her delegation had on several occasions argued in favour of putting in place a system to evaluate WTO technical cooperation. The document WT/COMTD/W/58 reflected discussions held by members in the autumn of 1998, and the agreement members that the WTO's approach to evaluation should be simple, objective, transparent and practical. Her delegation was of the view that the proposed questionnaires were in line with these criteria, though the questionnaires would possibly need refinement in the future once sufficient experience of their use in evaluation had been gained. She said evaluation was a learning by doing process, and that having discussed the issue at a theoretical level, it was now time to proceed in practical terms. If the CTD was in a position to endorse the questionnaires soon, the Secretariat could start applying the questionnaire by July 1999, and could provide a first evaluation report by early 2000. Her delegation was prepared to give the Secretariat green light for the use of the questionnaires, and to refine the questionnaires in the course of their use.","WTCOMTDM24.pdf","Norway, Secretariat, WTO, WTO, WTO, CTD, Secretariat, Secretariat"
"1915",1915,"92","92.      In response to these points, the Director of the Technical Cooperation Division said that a distinction needed to be made between an integrated response and an integrated framework. The Integrated Framework was an integrated response by six different international organisations to meet the needs of LDCs on a country basis. When conducting a technical mission to LDCs, the Secretariat's intention at the outset was to make use of the two questionnaire forms. In addition, the information would be inputted into the Integrated Framework in order to asses the extent to which the integrated response made by the six different organisations had been successful in meeting the needs of the LDC. Thus, while a distinction could be drawn between framework and response through a project, the two ideas were related.","WTCOMTDM24.pdf","Director, Technical, Cooperation, Division, Secretariat, Integrated, Framework"
"1914",1914,"91","91.     The representative of Switzerland drew the attention of the meeting to the wording of paragraph 18 of WT/COMTD/W/58, which seemed to suggest that the Integrated Framework for Trade-Related Technical Assistance was itself a technical assistance project, whereas the Secretariat had emphasised clearly, at the meeting of the Sub-Committee on Least-Developed Countries of 1 March 1999, the difference between the Integrated Framework for Trade-related Technical Assistance itself and specific technical assistance projects. He hoped that the wording in WT/COMTD/W/58 was simply a textual error and did not reflect a misunderstanding by the Secretariat of the concept of the Integrated Framework for Trade-Related Technical Assistance.","WTCOMTDM24.pdf","Switzerland, Integrated, Framework, for, Trade-Related, Technical, Assistance, Secretariat, Integrated, Framework, for, Trade-related, Technical, Assistance, Secretariat, Integrated, Framework, for, Trade-Related, Technical, Assistance"
"1913",1913,"90","90.      The representative of Switzerland said his delegation appreciated the Secretariat's efforts to develop an effective method of technical co-operation. He agreed that, in some ways, WTO technical assistance activities were not comparable to those carried out by other agencies owing to differences in duration and financial cost. However the Secretariat could still take advantage of the experience of other agencies in the field of technical cooperation and it's assessment. His delegation strongly recommended that cooperation with other agencies should continue. Questionnaires could only provide partial evaluation, and were in general not the most effective instrument. Switzerland did not fundamentally oppose a questionnaire-based approach, but did recommend that other instruments could be used. Evaluation, ideally, did not begin with the setting up of standard questionnaires, but with a clear definition of projects and their objectives, inputs, outputs, assumptions, and measurement indicators. Detailed proposals in this respect had been made in an informal note by the Swiss delegation distributed on 25 January 1999.","WTCOMTDM24.pdf","Switzerland, Secretariat, WTO, Secretariat, Switzerland"
"1912",1912,"9","9.      The representative of Egypt thanked the United States for showing flexibility on this issue, and said that his delegation supported the proposal for all nine organisations to be granted ad hoc Observer Status in the CTD.","WTCOMTDM24.pdf","Egypt, United, States, CTD"
"1911",1911,"89","89.      The document also had a section on the evaluation of joint programmes and activities with other organisations. In this instance, the Integrated Framework for Trade-related Technical Assistance and the Global Trade Analysis Project were refered to, in which the WTO contributed with other international organisations in the development and conduct of technical assistance. In this regard, the evaluation would be part of the overall evaluation stipulated in the joint programmes. The WTO also contributed as expert in the activities and programmes of the World Bank, WIPO, and other agencies. The impact of the WTO's participation could not be evaluated in isolation but only as part of the other activities which took place. At present, the WTO Secretariat was directly WT/COMTD/M/24 Page 14 accountable to donors for the use of their funds. Each year, the WTO reported individually to each donor in accordance with the memoranda of understanding signed with each donor. Attempts were being made to identify in more detail how the funds were used and their expected impact on the countries benefiting from assistance.","WTCOMTDM24.pdf","Integrated, Framework, for, Trade-related, Technical, Assistance, Global, Trade, Analysis, Project, WTO, WTO, World, Bank, WIPO, WTO, WTO, Secretariat, WTO"
"1910",1910,"88","88.      In order to begin assessing the impact of technical assistance, two evaluation forms had been developed which would be used simultaneously by WTO officials. The first form was entitled ""Country Request and Evaluation Form"" and would be completed in part by the Secretariat and in part by the country benefiting from technical cooperation. This form would capture all technical information that pertained to the event taking place, including the definition of the objectives of the activity to be carried out. At the conclusion of each event, the representatives of the beneficiary country would assess the activity and proceed with follow up. Further contact would take place with the country three to six months following the event to assess the impact of the activity, given that certain activities took time to bear fruit. The second questionnaire entitled ""Participant Evaluation and Feedback Form"" was intended to improve the quality of WTO technical cooperation through feedback by participants. It would also serve as feedback on how to improve further the delivery of technical cooperation. He reminded Members that these two questionnaires would be refined and extended as more experience was gained. In order to assess the effectiveness of technical assistance given, it was proposed to analyse the information by topic covered, assess the information by country, by region and sub-region, as well as by mode of delivery. The questionnaires would be used, if accepted, as of July 1999, with the possibility of having a first evaluation on the basis of these forms in the spring of 2000.","WTCOMTDM24.pdf","WTO, Secretariat, WTO, Members"
"1909",1909,"87","87.      WTO Technical Assistance now occupied an increasingly important place in overall WTO activities. In 1998, over 3000 technical cooperation activities took place, amounting to some Sfr.5 million, of which 80 per cent was financed through extra budgetary resources. This compared with the 79 activities undertaken with a budget of Sfr.700,000 in 1997. The current average duration of a national technical assistance activity was three to five days, at a cost of less than Sfr.20,000. Regional seminars lasted on average ten working days, at an average cost of Sfr.150,000. In the WTO, many technical cooperation activities were geared towards human and institutional capacity building, whereby the effects of the assistance could expected to be measured over time.","WTCOMTDM24.pdf","WTO, WTO, WTO"
"1908",1908,"86","86.      The Director of the Technical Cooperation Division, Mr Léger, recalled that members had agreed that the approach to evaluation of technical assistance should be simple, objective, transparent and practical. A representative of the ITC had been present at the informal meeting of 17 December 1998. Based on comments and suggestions made at this meeting, the two questionnaires had been revised, refined and circulated. The two questionnaires were designed to provide information regarding activities held in beneficiary countries, including the possible impact of assistance provided and expected follow up. The assessment would be part of the feedback process and would be beneficial to the operation of future activities on technical assistance. This note prepared by the Secretariat should be seen as a first step in the evaluation process and cover data collection only. It was developed taking into account the guidelines for the evaluation of WTO technical cooperation, adopted by the CTD on 15 October 1996, and the instruments outlined in the implementation modules of 17 October 1997.","WTCOMTDM24.pdf","Director, Technical, Cooperation, Division, Mr, Léger, ITC, Secretariat, WTO, CTD"
"1907",1907,"85","85.      Informal consultations took place on this item on 23 November 1998. At the 23rd Session of the CTD, Members agreed that any approach to the evaluation of WTO technical cooperation should be simple, objective, transparent and practical. Possible approaches could combine quantitative and qualitative approaches and could comprise internal as well as external audits. Members agreed to consult informally in order to develop evaluation modalities. These informal consultations took place on 17 December 1998. In the light of a series of consultations, including the Deputy                                                                                    WT/COMTD/M/24                                                                                           Page 13 Director-Director's consultations on 25 January 1999, the Secretariat produced revised proposals for two questionnaires for the evaluation of WTO Technical Cooperation programmes. These proposals were contained in document WT/COMTD/W/58, which had been circulated. The Chairman called on the Director of the Technical Cooperation Division, to introduce the documents.","WTCOMTDM24.pdf","CTD, Members, WTO, Members, Director-Director, Secretariat, WTO, Chairman, Director, Technical, Cooperation, Division"
"1906",1906,"84","84.       The Chairman said that the evaluation of WTO Technical Assistance Programmes was now a constant feature of the agenda of this Committee. At the 22nd Session of the CTD, the Secretariat circulated an issues paper (Job No: 4299) to assist reflection on the subject. The paper referred to the guidelines for technical cooperation and training, examined ways and means of assessing technical cooperation, made a distinction between internal and external evaluation, and addressed evaluation criteria.","WTCOMTDM24.pdf","Chairman, WTO, Technical, Assistance, Programmes, Committee, CTD, Secretariat"

Her delegation joined others in recognising the improvements in WTO technical assistance programmes, and drew the attention of the meeting to the question of language. Recognising that while the web site contained a wealth of information, most of it was in English. WTO members needed to have documents in all three official languages. Further investments had to be made to ensure that document dissemination was undertaken consistent with the trilingual policy of the WTO.","WTCOMTDM24.pdf","Cuba, Secretariat, WTO, WTO, WTO"
"1903",1903,"81","81.       The representative of Bangladesh thanked the Secretariat for the document. He said that Bangladesh was a big user of technical assistance, and added that the technical assistance package should be strengthened in some of it's aspect. His delegation had repeatedly asked that the number of Trade Policy Courses be increased to allow a larger intake of participants. He noted that the technical assistance budget depended on ad hoc grants from donors, and that this did not facilitate forward planning. His delegation appealed to developed Member donors to streamline procedures with respect to funding the technical assistance budget, and asked that the level of funding be increased. He highlighted the value of internships, and urged developed members to initiate programmes for trainees from LDCs. His delegation also favoured the equitable distribution amongst LDCs of the facilities available under the technical assistance programme.","WTCOMTDM24.pdf","Bangladesh, Secretariat, Bangladesh, Member"
"1902",1902,"80","80.     The representative for the European Communities thanked the Secretariat for the document, though she regretted it's late delivery, which hindered the ability of delegations to react in depth. Given the quality of the document, she suggested that the document could be derestricted.","WTCOMTDM24.pdf","European, Communities, Secretariat"
"1901",1901,"8","8.      The representative of the United States informed Members that her delegation was agreeable to the granting of ad hoc Observer Status for all nine organisations for the next regularly scheduled meeting of the CTD. She said that the acceptance of her delegation was limited to the next meeting of the CTD, and that this decision would be reviewed when the nine organisations presented their requests for Observer Status again to the CTD. She added that the United States had submitted a proposal to the General Council for the conduct of consultations on guidelines for granting permanent Observer Status. She said that the United States treated the granting of Observer Status as a serious issue, and were very interested in the General Council Chairman's work on this subject, adding that any decision on the granting of permanent Observer Status in the CTD should await the completion of the General Council's work on the issue.","WTCOMTDM24.pdf","United, States, Members, CTD, CTD, CTD, United, States, General, Council, United, States, General, Council, Chairman, CTD, General, Council"

The representative of Norway, speaking on behalf of Hong Kong, China and Norway, referred to the CTD meeting on 2 November 1998, in which the Three-Year Plan on Technical Assistance Activities was discussed. He recalled that the need to increase cooperation with other international organisations and the need to out-source part of WTO technical assistance activities had been discussed. The two delegations requested that the Secretariat report to the CTD in respect of progress in the follow up work undertaken by the Secretariat pursuant to the discussion.","WTCOMTDM24.pdf","Norway, Hong, Kong, China, Norway, CTD, WTO, Secretariat, CTD, Secretariat"
"1899",1899,"78","78.    The Director of the Technical Cooperation Division replied that passwords were given to the Head of delegation, whose responsibility it then was to distribute the password to capitals. He also WT/COMTD/M/24 Page 12 said that the Secretariat would, as technology evolved, follow up with developing countries in order to examine possible difficulties in down-loading information.","WTCOMTDM24.pdf","Director, Technical, Cooperation, Division, Head, Secretariat"
"1898",1898,"77","77.      The representative of Tanzania joined the delegation of Egypt in thanking the Secretariat for it's paper, and said he had two questions. First, in relation to paragraph 5 of the document WT/COMTD/W/59 concerning password protection of restricted documents, he asked whether passwords were available to both delegations and capitals, as his delegation had at times tried and failed to access restricted documents. Second, he asked whether the Secretariat had a strategy to ensure that LDCs would be able adapt to and keep pace with changes in software and hardware technology. For instance he noted that he had difficulty in printing documents from the Documentation Dissemination Facility.","WTCOMTDM24.pdf","Tanzania, Egypt, Secretariat, Secretariat"
"1897",1897,"76","76.      The representative of Egypt thanked the Director of the Technical Cooperation Division for his presentation, and said his delegation would study the paper closely. He recalled that the reason motivating his delegation's request for a paper was the recognition by the Director General and others that the WTO information technology system was complex and that work was required to render it accessible to delegations and those not well versed in information technology. The representative of Egypt recognised that tremendous progress had been achieved. He noted that the paper contained several important sections of interest to his delegation. He cited as an example the delivery of Trade Policy Courses in electronic form, which would serve to meet the strong demand for such courses in his country. His delegation would reflect on the paper further, and revert to the issue of information technology in the delivery of technical assistance at a future meeting.","WTCOMTDM24.pdf","Egypt, Director, Technical, Cooperation, Division, Director, WTO, Egypt"
"1896",1896,"75","75.      Furthermore, the Secretariat already made use of computer based presentations in the delivery of technical assistance. Videos prepared for the press could be used for technical cooperation activities, and the WTO had a training package providing a comprehensive exposure to the WTO that was accessible on the WTO Web-Site. Computer Based Training was available on CD ROM, capturing the contents of WTO Trade Policy courses in multi-media mode, with a pilot already available on textiles and clothing. The secretariat had made use of the World Bank Learning Network, now established in some 40 countries, for instance in conjunction with the video conference on notifications. Web Casting technology had also been used for the first time in conjunction with the WTO Ministerial Meeting of May 1998 and would be used during the High Level Symposia on Trade and Environment and Trade and Development to be held in March 1999. Web Casting allowed for participation in events on-line when physical presence was not possible. Distance Learning could augment the impact of technical cooperation activities, and could be seen as part of a wider intellectual information technology based programme centred on capacity building. The Secretariat also foresaw the use of Information Technology in the holding of ""virtual meetings"", which could be used to promote the exchange of views by trade officials.","WTCOMTDM24.pdf","Secretariat, WTO, WTO, WTO, Web-Site, WTO, World, Bank, Learning, Network, WTO, Environment, and, Trade, and, Development, Secretariat, Information, Technology"
"1895",1895,"74","74.    The paper also included a section on improved communications, and the introduction of IT as a means of reducing times, distances and costs, insofar as communications with developing countries                                                                                   WT/COMTD/M/24                                                                                          Page 11 are concerned, through the use of e-mail, on line fora and video conferencing. All these had a multiplier effect in terms of the number of people reached and allowed the WTO to enhance the scope and coverage of it's technical assistance. All staff in the Secretariat had e-mail, and generic e-mail addresses had been established, for notifications are concerned and for the WTO reference centre help desk. Insofar as on-line fora were concerned, several had already taken place: for instance a conference on intellectual property rights took place over a period of 5 months with over 300 registered participants. A second conference, entitled ""The WTO and Developing Countries"" was under way. A third one on regionalism was due to begin in the first week of March. Two types of video conferencing were possible: point to point connections, or multi-point links. Video conferencing was seen as an important tool for lecturing, question and answer sessions, as well as for technical missions. Examples included a short term trade policy course held in Turin in October 1998, and a video conference on notifications held in February 1999, which involved 65 officials in four different countries – Malawi, Kenya, Ghana and Zimbabwe.","WTCOMTDM24.pdf","WTO, Secretariat, WTO, WTO, Turin, Malawi, Kenya, Ghana, Zimbabwe"
"1894",1894,"73","73.      The Director of the Technical Cooperation Division, Mr. Léger, informed the meeting that the document provided background information in the use of information technology in the delivery of technical assistance, and covered information dissemination, improving communications, information technology based delivery of technical assistance, and options for the future. Under the heading information dissemination, it was indicated that in order to maximise the usefulness of information made available by the WTO, potential recipients of information needed to have appropriate infrastructure and training for efficient retrieval of information available in the WTO. In this connection the WTO undertook to establish Reference Centres on the multilateral trading system. This comprised the procurement of computer equipment, internet connectivity, and training on how to access CD ROMs that were made available at that time. By December 1998, WTO Reference Centres had been established in all LDC countries. The WTO Web Site contained 11,000 pages about the rules and mechanisms of the multilateral trading system, legal texts, latest news on the WTO, schedules of meetings, the Document Dissemination Facility, and much other information. At present, there were over 100, 000 user visits on the Web Site per month, from about 140 countries, including an increasing number from LDCs. A second web site made available through the WTO reference centre was the Information Technologies for Development (ITD) website. The ITD was a joint initiative of the WTO and the Economic Development Institute of the World Bank which focused on the relationship of trade to social and economic development. Comments on issues were illustrated through case studies, inter-active guides, and on-line conference facilities. A third web-site available was the LDC web-site, established in the context of the Integrated Framework for Trade-related Technical Assistance to LDCs. The site was a management tool for the six International Agencies who were dealing with the Integrated Framework, and also served as a communications tool for stakeholders in the process. Finally, when the WTO Reference Centres were established, users were also provided with a number of electronic publications as CD ROM products. These included the results of the Uruguay Round, the Guide to GATT Law and Practice, the Analytical index, the GATT BISD, Trade Policy Review Collection, WTO Trade Statistics, and a CD representing the WTO Internet Site at a certain cut-off date.","WTCOMTDM24.pdf","Director, Technical, Cooperation, Division, Léger, WTO, WTO, WTO, WTO, WTO, WTO, WTO, Information, Technologies, for, Development, WTO, Economic, Development, Institute, of, the, World, Bank, Integrated, Framework, for, Trade-related, Technical, Assistance, Integrated, Framework, WTO, Uruguay, Round, GATT, GATT, WTO, Trade, Statistics, WTO"

The Chairman recalled that, at the 22nd Session of the CTD, the Egyptian delegation requested the Secretariat to prepare a Background Note on the use of Information Technology in the delivery of technical assistance. At that meeting, Members recognized the significant benefits that could accrue and the potentially vast improvements in access to beneficiaries that could be made through the use of Information Technology in the delivery of technical assistance. The Secretariat's background note has now been circulated in document WT/COMTD/W/59.

His delegation was particularly interested in work undertaken in the other subsidiary bodies and what consideration had been given to the definition of electronic commerce. For instance Council on Trade in Services provided a definition of electronic commerce which covered the delivery of goods, such as hardware, by non electronic means. He wished to know whether electronic commerce referred to transactions that would solely be dealt with by means of the internet. He said that recently undertaken research that concluded that duty free cyberspace transactions will not have serious fiscal WT/COMTD/M/24 Page 10 consequences should be considered jointly with research currently being conducted by UNCTAD and the OECD.","WTCOMTDM24.pdf","Mexico, Egypt, Council, on, Trade, in, Services, UNCTAD, OECD"

She also noted the comments from some of the Members which targeted issues raised since the launching of the programme. She pointed out that the paper circulated by her delegation contained a section on development which indicated current developments concerning the United States's new development assistance project. This project was conducted separately from the WTO through the United States' aid agencies.

He recalled that the deadline for WTO bodies to provide information to the General Council was 30 July 1999 and that the CTD therefore only had two meetings, including the present meeting, left at which it could decide on its final contribution. He proposed that the contribution could take the form of a letter from the Chair of the CTD, to the Chair of the General Council explaining, on the responsibility of the Chair of the CTD, the discussions held by the CTD.        1          WT/COMTD/W/38 of 3 March 1998.        2          WT/COMTD/W/51 of 23 November 1998.        3          WT/COMTD/17 of 12 February 1999.

She noted that representatives speaking at the meeting had presented conflicting understandings on the nature of the waiver, with on one hand some speakers asserting that the waiver was political and would not alter the balance of rights and obligations of Members, while her delegation, on the other, had been of the view that the waiver was of a juridical nature. This understanding was supported by the Director-General's explanation, and given that the waiver went beyond the provisions of the Enabling Clause, her delegation was willing to join the consensus in favour of adopting the draft Decision.","WTCOMTDM24.pdf","India, India, Members, Director-General"

The additions proposed by Uruguay and paragraph 6 of the waiver satisfied his delegation that the Enabling Clause would not be undermined, as did the Deputy Director-General's explanation. He therefore suggested that the Chairman, when presenting the draft Decision, make a statement under his own responsibility containing the thrust of the Deputy Director-General's explanation.

The Deputy Director-General said the draft Decision on the waiver was pursuant to footnote 2 of the Enabling Clause, which stated that if there was a particular action that members wished to take that was not covered by the Enabling Clause, an ad hoc decision could be taken. He said that the waiver was for ten years and not for perpetuity, and its was open to members to decide for themselves whether it constituted an ad hoc decision or not.

Footnote 2 of paragraph 2 of the Enabling Clause stated that ""it would be open to Contracting Parties to consider on an ad hoc basis under the GATT provisions for joint action any proposals for differential and more favourable treatment not falling within the scope of [paragraph 2]"". She said the footnote provided an important criterion for the consideration of ad hoc possibilities for developing countries to grant concessions to LDCs.

"1849",1849,"32","32.      The Deputy Director-General, Mr. Hoda, said that the question posed by the representative of India had previously been raised in the informal consultations, and that he would repeat the explanation he had provided on that occasion. He recalled that paragraphs 2(c) and 2(d) of the Enabling Clause together constituted the legal basis for the provision of unilateral preferential treatment regarding products of interest to LDCs. Paragraph 2(c) provided for developing countries to enter into global or regional trade arrangements to give preferences to each other on a mutual and reciprocal basis. Paragraph 2(d) provided for the special treatment of Least Developed Countries in the context of any general or specific measure in favour of developing countries. Thus, if a developing country wished to provide special treatment to LDCs in the context of the GSTP or regional arrangements, it could do so on the basis of the Enabling Clause, and this was reflected in paragraph 6 of the draft Decision. The additionality provided for by the waiver, covered the extension of preferential treatment by developing countries to LDCs outside any existing global arrangement and outside any regional arrangement. Mr. Hoda said that the waiver represented a juridical action since it added to the provisions of the Enabling Clause.","WTCOMTDM24.pdf","Director-General, Hoda, India, Hoda"

Korea was willing to provide preferential treatment to LDCs, but feared that this could lead to litigation before the DSB and, therefore, strongly supported establishing a firm legal basis for such treatment.","WTCOMTDM24.pdf","Republic, of, Korea, Members, Korea, Korea, DSB"

The draft Decision had been thoroughly reviewed, and at the last meeting everyone had been of the view that the draft Decision would gain the approval of the CTD at this meeting.

His delegation viewed with some scepticism the possibility that the waiver might result in a significant increase in exports by LDCs to emerging markets. Discussions in the Sub- Committee on Least Developed Countries suggested that supply side constraints were possibly more important than market access barrier; goods produced by LDCs often competed with products from developing countries, and it was necessary to take into account the financial crises experienced by many emerging markets. He said that the implementation of differential access measures by developed counties had been insufficient to enhance the integration of the LDCs into the global market. His delegation understood that the waiver did not alter the primary responsibility of developed countries, foreseen in the single undertaking of the Uruguay Round, in applying the provisions of special and differential treatment, and that it did not alter the basic balance of rights and obligations.","WTCOMTDM24.pdf","Brazil, Sub, -, Committee, on, Least, Developed, Countries, LDCs, LDCs, Uruguay, Round"

There was no link between exchange rate depreciations and exports by LDCs into Latin America, and Mexico had not imposed antidumping or safeguard measures on any LDC exports.

The representative of India said that his delegation had indicated to the Deputy Director-General, at the informal meeting of 25 January, that India was not in favour of the draft Decision. He reiterated India's commitment to LDCs, including the granting of market access measures through the GSTP and regional trade arrangements such as SAFTA, which India had expressed at the High Level Meeting on Integrated Initiatives for Least Developed Countries' Trade Development. He said that Paragraph 2(c) of the Enabling Clause provided for preferential tariff and non tariff treatment to be extended by WTO Members to LDCs, and that Uruguay's proposal for the inclusion of a disclaimer in the body of the draft Decision suggested that the Enabling Clause was juridically sufficient for developing countries to grant preferential treatment to LDCs. His delegation was therefore not convinced of the utility of the draft Decision, feeling it would undermine the Enabling Clause, and wanted to know what juridical additionality was sought through the waiver, over and above the provisions of the Enabling Clause.","WTCOMTDM24.pdf","India, Director-General, India, India, SAFTA, India, Integrated, Initiatives, for, Least, Developed, Countries, ', Trade, Development, WTO, Members, Uruguay"

Ambassador Diallo invited the CTD to reflect and initiate progress on the different items under its consideration, notably the following: an exchange of views on the elements of the development dimension; the integration of developing countries in the trading system in terms of market access, and in terms of the formulation and application of trade policy in the WTO; improvements in the quality and delivery of technical assistance geared to the needs identified by developing countries themselves; an analysis of difficulties in the application of provisions for special and differential treatment; and the contribution of the committee to the next Ministerial Conference. She proposed that this last issue be an agenda item at the June meeting of the CTD, adding that it would be the occasion to reflect on the next ministerial in an extensive, focussed and coherent way. She said that the list of issues she enumerated was not exhaustive, but exploratory and indicative of what the CTD could decide to cover.

She thanked the Chairman for his efforts throughout his tenure, and congratulated him for the results he had achieved. She stated that 1999 would be a year of many challenges. The High Level Symposium on Trade and Development was due to be held in Mid March. The Third Ministerial Conference could be the occasion to initiate a likely new round of multilateral trade negotiations on multilateral trade. The importance of the development dimension remained, for CTD members, the link between these different meetings. The most significant part of the CTD's mandate lay in it's role as central point for the review and coordination of the development work carried out by the WTO. She shared the point of view of developing countries who had emphasised that the development dimension should feature in the work of the Organisation, and said that this view was also shared by members of the CTD. She said trade liberalisation was good for all countries, and the goal of liberalisation should be the welfare of the population of Member countries. For this reason, she would devote all her energy in the pursuit of the objectives of the WTO and the fulfilment of the mandate of the CTD.","WTCOMTDM24.pdf","Ambassador, Diallo, chairman, CTD, Africa, Chairman, CTD, WTO, Organisation, CTD, Member, WTO, CTD"

He requested that the Secretariat take into account the various submissions made. He recognised that undertaking analytical work on the impact of S & D provisions, as proposed by Brazil, would add substantially to the work of the Secretariat and that his delegation would be satisfied, as an intermediate stage, with a simple compilation of responses to questionnaires.

He said that because the work of the Secretariat was limited to a mere objective compilation of Special and Differential provisions, it could imply that these provisions responded adequately to the needs of better integrating developing countries into the multilateral trading system. Such a perception did not enjoy consensus in this CTD, and Brazil believed that some of these provisions needed to be revisited if a reasonable balance of rights and obligations was to be achieved in the multilateral trading system. The representative of Brazil said that, in the light of these remarks and the possible launching of a new round of multilateral trade negotiations, his delegation proposed that the Secretariat undertake, on the basis of the questionnaire, analytical work on the participation of developing countries in the multilateral system.","WTCOMTDM24.pdf","Brazil, Brazil, WTO, Secretariat, Secretariat, Brazil, Brazil, Secretariat"

It was emphasised that without replies from a representative group of Members, work carried out on implementation would be incomplete, and appealed to members to submit responses. The collation of relevant information existing within the Secretariat had involved all relevant Divisions and Secretaries of Committees.

It was necessary to correct the lack of progress on rules of origin, in view of the fact that not all countries have equal privileges and rights in the determination of such rules, which was controlled by developed countries through a number of international institutions including international financial agencies. Furthermore, small states had been compelled to accept long term benefits of adjustments without measurement of the impact on social and WT/COMTD/M/24 Page 20 economic conditions. Her delegation supported the establishment of programmes of assistance in favour of small states and LDCs to support the cost of adjustment. The erosion of trade preferences through regional trade agreements had a particular impact on small countries, given their vulnerability and the fact that they could only function in the world market efficiently through the provision of preferences. The CTD should contribute to the understanding that the implementation of liberalisation policies in small states should respect the different levels of development prevailing in these countries and their susceptibility to natural disasters.","WTCOMTDM24.pdf","Cuba, Guatemala, Fiji, Mauritius, LDCs, CTD"

He said the aim of the meeting was to hold the widest possible consultations regarding the issue of vulnerability and appropriate policy responses. Taking its cue from Mr. J. Burki (Vice-President for Latin America and the Caribbean Region, the World Bank), the conference considered the following issues: the implications of high volatility in GDP; problems of economies of scale; advantages arising from trade openness; the role of trade preferences in growth; opportunities created by globalisation, and transitional cost of integrating small economies into the global economy; development of vulnerability index with widest acceptability; use of financial instruments in mitigating the adverse effects of disasters; the pursuit of sound domestic economic policies that encourage domestic savings to finance development; and support from donors to resolve transitional problems of ""graduation"". The representative of Mauritius pointed to the conclusions reached by the conference: there was consensus that the lending policies of multilateral agencies needed to be adjusted to meet the special needs of small states, including Bank willingness to structure it's policies of lending and assistance to small states; the inadequacy of the per capita income criterion in determining the eligibility of small states for [multilateral lending]; small states should take advantage of globalisation, and that substantial flows of external resources would be required to meet costs of transition. Following the conclusion of the meeting, the Advisory Board and the task force met, and it was agreed that the results of the conference and the report would be submitted to the Development Committee of the World Bank and the IMF. The representative of Mauritius said that it was his perception, on the basis of discussion which took place, that the joint members representatives would address the CTD at its meeting on 2 June.

The main focus of the conference had been the vulnerability of small island economies, resulting in part from external catastrophes and also from external shocks to income and exports. At the meeting, the World Bank and the Commonwealth Secretariat provided a revised draft of their Vulnerability Index. In relation to the trade aspect, the meeting focussed on the ways and means of strengthening the participation of small states in the WTO system. Emphasis was also placed on finding ways by which small states could cooperate with others on issues of concern, such as the building of technical capacity, or participation in WTO meetings in Geneva. Mr. Tulloch confirmed that the trade issue was being covered in a paper under preparation jointly by the World Bank and the Commonwealth Secretariat, and that this paper would be presented first to the IMF and World Bank Development Committee and that the authors of the paper would be willing and able to present the paper to the Committee on Trade and Development at it's next meeting.","WTCOMTDM24.pdf","Tulloch, Members, CTD, Small, Island, Economies, World, Bank, Commonwealth, Secretariat, St., Lucia, World, Bank, Commonwealth, Secretariat, WTO, WTO, Geneva, Tulloch, World, Bank, Commonwealth, Secretariat, IMF, World, Bank, Development, Committee, Committee, on, Trade, and, Development"

He agreed with the representative of the European Communities that an informal meeting should be held to discuss the paper circulated and review a number of proposals relating to trade facilitation. He proposed that a representative of the ACP be invited to the informal meeting in view of the suggestions made by the ACP at a previous meeting. He asked whether a letter from the CTD to the Council on Trade in Goods was the most efficient means by which the CTD could contribute to the discussion on trade facilitation, given that the issue was of major interest especially as technical cooperation and education were concerned.","WTCOMTDM24.pdf","Mexico, CTD, ACP, ACP, CTD, CTD"

The document entitled Trade Facilitation and Development aimed to show that the benefits of trade facilitation accrued to all Members and in particular developing countries. The second document entitled Trade Facilitation in Relation to Existing WTO Agreements highlighted the leading role of the WTO in furthering the objectives of trade facilitation, and identified the different ""hooks"" in existing WTO agreements which can be used to achieve the simplification of trade procedures.","WTCOMTDM24.pdf","European, Communities, Members, European, Commission, Trade, Facilitation, and, Development, Members, WTO, WTO, WTO"

He recalled that the Secretariat's Informal Note on Observer Status stated that non-attendance for a period of one year would cause Observer Status to lapse. He stated that the monitoring of attendance should be reactivated; and it would be necessary to consider rewriting the criteria for granting Observer Status, if the current criteria were not sufficiently clear to allow speedy decisions to made, and that this task should be undertaken through the General Council.","WTCOMTDM24.pdf","Republic, of, Korea, United, States, Secretariat, General, Council"

The Chairman informed the meeting that the Council for Trade in Goods would hold an informal meeting on 19 and 20 April at which it would discuss electronic facilities and their importance for facilitating international trade; technical cooperation and development issues relating to the simplification of trade procedures; and consider WTO Agreements relating to, or including provisions, on trade facilitation. It was foreseen that contributions by other WTO bodies, including the CTD, would be considered at that meeting. The Chairman said the CTD should use the current meeting to decide upon its contribution, and invited suggestions from delegations for a CTD contribution to the Work Programme of the Council for Trade in Goods. He suggested that the contribution take the form of a letter to the Chairman of the Committee on Trade in Goods in which the Chairman of the CTD would explain, on his own responsibility, the discussions held in the Committee on Trade and development.","WTCOMTDM24.pdf","Chairman, Council, for, Trade, in, Goods, WTO, WTO, CTD, Chairman, CTD, CTD, Council, for, Trade, in, Goods, Chairman, Committee, on, Trade, in, Goods, Chairman, CTD, Committee, on, Trade"

The Chairman said that in a letter addressed to him, dated 1 September 1998, Ambassador Saborío, Chairman of the Council for Trade in Goods, requested the Committee on Trade and Development to contribute to the Work Programme on Trade Facilitation of the Council for Trade in Goods. The CTD had since discussed trade facilitation at two of its meetings. However, very few concrete issues relating to development aspects of trade facilitation were identified by delegations. At its meeting of 7 December 1998, the Committee on Trade and Development asked the Secretariat to produce a draft document for its contribution. Secretariat note WT/COMTD/LDC/W/15 aimed at meeting that request. He added that the European Communities had recently submitted a paper on trade facilitation and development. The document would soon be circulated as a multi-symbol document.

Second, he indicated that feedback referred to the topics covered, and whether these had met the objectives of the event; the handling of logistics; the suitability and timely distribution of documentation; and the sequencing of the presentation.

He said that there was some discrepancy between the information required of applicant bodies, as detailed in the Note, and the actual letters of application that had been forwarded to the delegations. While his delegation did not have any substantive objection to any of the Members, it did consider that procedural and systemic issues were involved. It was difficult to formulate a judgement regarding the applications against the criteria set out in the Note, on the basis of the short letters sent.

The representative of the United States stated that his delegation supported the concept of introducing procedures to allow a better internal evaluation by the Secretariat of its technical assistance activities. Technical assistance was a partnership between the secretariat and the recipient, with an important role played by members. He said the delivery of technical assistance was one WT/COMTD/M/23 Page 22 component of a process that began with the identification of needs, continued with the development and delivery of the programme by the Secretariat, in combination with appropriate officials from the recipient country, and was supported by follow up. The identification of needs was one of the most important parts of the process, and was required for the effective evaluation of technical assistance. The beneficiary country had the main responsibility to ensure that requests for technical assistance were well focussed. While it is incumbent on the Secretariat to ensure follow up to their programmes, it was equally important for beneficiaries to provide on-going structures for those attending training and to ensure that information was used to achieve the goals of the training activity.

He pointed out that the cost of any technical assistance provided by the ICC needed to exceed a lower limit of 300,000 to 400,000 Swiss Francs before any evaluation took place. Therefore, the WTO should not be compared to the ITC or the UNCTAD, with respect to technical assistance activities.

He then recalled the concern, expressed at the time of writing of the Secretariat Note, regarding the availability of funds for technical assistance, and asked whether any developments in this respect had taken place since the distribution of the Note. He further recalled that his delegation had requested the preparation of a factual paper by the Secretariat, for the purpose of transparency, regarding conditions associated with the funds that had been provided to the WTO for technical assistance.

Current discussions centred around issues such as whether evaluation should be internal or external, determination of criteria and methodology, etc. These discussions risked indefinite continuation. Noting that no date had been set for informal consultations, the representative of Switzerland expressed dissatisfaction with the present state of affairs. His delegation was not opposed to external evaluation, adding that there was no contradiction between external evaluation and the internal evaluation which had already started. He added that external evaluation should not interfere with the procedures already set up by the Secretariat, and suggested that an expert from the International Trade Centre (ITC) could be invited to attend the consultations, to provide expertise and advice in devising criteria and methodology for the evaluation of WTO technical assistance.","WTCOMTDM23.pdf","Switzerland, Switzerland, Secretariat, International, Trade, Centre, ITC, WTO"

He stated that external evaluation should be a systematic complement to internal evaluation, and that the guidelines and modalities for implementation adopted by the Committee left the window open for external evaluation. The Secretariat Note (Job No. 4299) of 26 August 1998 mentioned this possibility and explained certain important aspects of external evaluation. He added that his delegation had on several occasions underlined the positive impact of external evaluation on technical assistance. The recourse to external evaluation ensured objectivity in addressing the concerns of all involved and in the measurement of the impact of technical assistance in enhancing capacity. External evaluation facilitated the implementation of technical cooperation programmes, ensured linkages between activities, allowed for increased transparency and quality control, and could facilitate the streamlining of the use of human resources in the WTO.","WTCOMTDM23.pdf","Morocco, Committee, Secretariat, WTO"

He noted that the Egyptian delegation to the Lyon Meeting consisted of 18 people, 14 of whom were from Cairo, and who were active in a number of fields, such as agriculture, micro-finance and the private sector. He expressed the view that, for the first time, real partnerships had been made, and that the choice of subjects covered in the summit was excellent. He noted that while some of the issues discussed were new, and others longstanding, they were all approached from a new perspective, and all required the arrangement of public - private partnerships. He hoped that similarly innovative events could be repeated in the future, and stated that his delegation would follow the matter up with UNCTAD. He proposed that the meeting be held every four years as a regular feature of UNCTAD's activities, adding that he hoped that others would support such a trend.","WTCOMTDM23.pdf","Egypt, Gurunlian, France, Lyon, Raymond, Barre, Cairo, UNCTAD, UNCTAD"

The subjects discussed in the first group were electronic commerce and transport, in view of the fact that e-commerce presented significant opportunities for developing countries, while high transport costs posed a significant problem for developing countries. Agreed partnerships included the provision of free services by four of the five major Information Technology consultancy firms to developing countries wishing to undertake a study of their legal framework for E-Commerce, and an arrangement between IRU and 80 countries to better manage transit traffic. The second group was given the title of ""Profits and Development"", reflecting the fact that there can be a convergence between the profit motive of private enterprise and development objectives. Areas covered included the following: (i) commodities, particularly the minimisation of risks resulting from price fluctuations, and the use of modern financial instruments to reduce transaction costs; (ii) micro- finance, were a notable achievement in convincing several large financial institutions to raise funds from international markets in order that these be lent by micro-finance institutions; (iii) investment, through the participation of the Association for the Promotion of Investment; and, (iv) the Bio-trade programme, based on the Convention on Bio-trade which seeks to strengthen the negotiating position of indigenous peoples, in order to allow them to benefit from the marketing gains on products based on indigenous resources.","WTCOMTDM23.pdf","Gurunlian, Information, Technology, IRU, Association, for, the, Promotion, of, Investment"

Mr. Gurunlian recalled that the Lyon Meeting was the outcome of the mandate given to the Secretary General to organise a single meeting to serve as an example of what UNCTAD might achieve in conjunction with civil society. The meeting could not be financed out of the regular                                                                                    WT/COMTD/M/23                                                                                           Page 19 budget, and the support of sponsors, and particularly the City of Lyon, was critical. The representatives of civil society attending the Meeting were invited on the basis of their capacity to participate in partnerships for development. There were 5000 participants at the summit and half were from the private sector. Fifty Ministers and six heads of states attended, as did numerous NGOs. Mr. Gurunlian stated that the organisers of the meeting had the courage to address a number of sensitive procedural issues. For instance, no speeches were given and there was no negotiated text to adopt which allowed participants to focus on discussing the main issues covered by the summit. Ministers and representatives of NGOs were placed on equal footing.","WTCOMTDM23.pdf","Gurunlian, UNCTAD, Lyon, Gurunlian"

"1725",1725,"72","72.      The representative of Canada was confident that the Seminar on Electronic Commerce and Development, scheduled for February 1999, would assist in achieving the objectives of the CTD Work Programme on Electronic Commerce. Her delegation underscored the importance of clear objectives for the February 1999 Seminar. This objective had to be linked to the overall objectives of the WTO Work Programme. She agreed with the proposal by the Secretariat to structure the Seminar on two themes, and also to include private sector participation. However, the first theme: the business use of electronic commerce, might be re-phrased to encompass private/public partnerships. In the case of the second theme: legal and regulatory issues at the governmental level, the focus could be on trade-related issues within the purview of the WTO Work Programme. Regarding substantive discussions at the February 1999 Seminar, her delegation hoped that discussions at other fora, such as at the UNCTAD ""Partners for Development"" Meeting at Lyon, France, 9-12 November 1998, although very useful, would not be duplicated. The CTD Seminar should focus on the development aspects of electronic commerce related to the WTO Work Programme. The CTD document provided a good starting-point for discussions on the development implications of e-commerce. Her delegation would comment more fully on the Secretariat document at a later stage.","WTCOMTDM23.pdf","Canada, Electronic, Commerce, and, Development, CTD, Work, Programme, Electronic, Commerce, WTO, Work, Programme, Secretariat, WTO, Work, Programme, UNCTAD, Lyon, France, WTO, Work, Programme, CTD, Secretariat"

The representative of the Secretariat stated that the Secretariat would take account of the issues raised in preparing for the Seminar on Electronic Commerce and Development, 19 February 1999. He reminded Members that the Secretariat outline for the Seminar had been earlier circulated informally. The outline had been focused on two themes namely on: (i) the business use of electronic commerce; and, (ii) the legal/regulatory issues at the level of government. He appealed to Members from developed and developing countries to forward to the Secretariat names of successful companies and of individuals or organizations in countries that could make useful contributions to the private sector and to the governmental legal and regulatory questions.","WTCOMTDM23.pdf","Secretariat, Secretariat, Electronic, Commerce, and, Development, Members, Secretariat, Members, Secretariat"

He also welcomed the Seminar to be organized by the United States private sector on 8 and 9 December 1998, which would be of tremendous assistance to developing country Members in their assessments of the potential benefits of e-commerce and information technology. He also agreed with the representative of the European Communities that many of the issues which had been raised in the course of the discussions under item on e-commerce in the CTD could be used in preparation for the Seminar in February 1999. It was also hoped that the concerns which had been raised should also be addressed in the course of the Seminar. There was an urgent need for more information on the issue of revenue loss. His delegation was not fearful of the overall benefits of e-commerce, but to the contrary was confident that the benefits of e-commerce would outweigh the losses. However, he simply desired a better understanding of the potential for and impact of possible revenue loss particularly in the light of the revenue situation of many developing countries. Finally, his delegation requested for informal consultations on the issues raised before the Seminar on Electronic Commerce and Development scheduled for February 1999.","WTCOMTDM23.pdf","Egypt, United, States, United, States, Members, CTD, Electronic, Commerce, and, Development"

"1719",1719,"67","67.      The Secretariat document was a good basis for discussions in the CTD. The document should become the basis for further evolution and improvements in the CTD's deeper evaluation of the subject. It was possible that relevant recommendations could be drawn from the document. The index of document could be improved and re-ordered on a practical basis to achieve the goals of the CTD in the light of the forthcoming Seminar on Electronic Commerce and Development, 19 February 1999.     His delegation suggested the re-ordering of the Secretariat document as follows: (a) introduction - ""potential benefits""; (b) problems of infrastructure; (c) transparency; (d) transfer of technology; (e) effects of e-commerce on employment and movements of physical persons, effects of e-commerce on small- or medium-size businesses; (f) financial implications; (g) legal issues; (h) control of internet contents; (i) technical cooperation; and, (j) conclusions and recommendations.","WTCOMTDM23.pdf","Secretariat, CTD, CTD, CTD, Electronic, Commerce, and, Development, Secretariat"
"1718",1718,"66","66.      Several relevant issues could be identified in the Secretariat document, the representative of Mexico had identified several salient and relevant issues including: infrastructure for e-commerce. Modern telecommunications network and electricity distribution facilities were beneficial for developing countries and LDCs which lagged behind on such basic services. The problems in this area of services were technical and required more resources for their resolution. An important aspect of the resolution of the problem depended on government participation combined with technical assistance from and cooperation with the WTO and other international organizations such as the ITU, UNCTAD, etc. Technology was a key factor in the promotion of electronic commerce. It was not simply a question of acquiring business know-how and resources, but also knowing how to apply this knowledge in a technical manner. In this regard, cooperation with international organizations competent in the area of e-commerce was fundamental. Regional bodies were also conducting analysis on electronic commerce. Access was also an important issue with three main elements - access to infrastructure (fax, telephones, computers, modems, software, hardware, etc.); access to internet connections which offered broader access to information services and possibilities for trade; and access to databases for business creation. Cost was also an important aspect. Currently, two trends were visible. First, a negative upward trend in cost where the infrastructure depended on the telecommunications rates and other computer installations. In this connection, the basic equipment costs for computers and telephones remained very high in developing countries and LDCs. Second, was the positive trend of falling costs for electronic use of documents or computerized information. Investment, education and training were also issues of cardinal importance.","WTCOMTDM23.pdf","Secretariat, Mexico, WTO, ITU, UNCTAD"
"1717",1717,"65","65.      The representative of Mexico welcomed the Secretariat paper on the development implications of electronic commerce and noted that in electronic commerce, it was obvious that assisting developing countries was also to assist oneself. The question, however, was how to conduct this assistance. It could be said that half of the problems were for governments to resolve, and the other half rested on global interdependence. In this regard, the developed countries had a lot to offer in international organizations. Promoting development to ensure that developing countries benefit from new technologies in electronic commerce should be the objective. The challenge was to ensure that technical assistance and the development dimension should be focused on productivity and trade                                                                                      WT/COMTD/M/23                                                                                             Page 17 viability of a country to ensure a more balanced development. Needs and the problems should be clearly defined, the extent of resources should be ascertained, and viable projects with productive possibilities for an open economy should be developed. New schemes in production for electronic commerce should be considered which promote competition and productivity, reduce transaction costs and promote employment as well as relations with external business partners, in particular with small and medium size enterprises.","WTCOMTDM23.pdf","Mexico, Secretariat"

In paragraph 51, the document highlighted the fact that computer software and services are now India's largest export earner. Against this background, India's interest in the subject of electronic commerce was evident. He associated his delegation with several points made by the representative of Egypt, and emphasised two points. First, India was interested in non-discriminatory access to and transfer of technology in this area. This objective was being separately pursued in discussions on electronic commerce in other fora. Second, in paragraph 39, the consequences for developments in this area in the field of movement of natural persons had been mentioned. He remarked that the problem of brain drain was not specific to the area of electronic commerce, but was a larger issue. Furthermore, the restrictions placed by some of the developed countries in the area of the movement of natural persons remained a strong barrier to international trade measures.","WTCOMTDM23.pdf","India, Secretariat, India, India, Egypt, India"
"1715",1715,"63","63.     The representative of Burundi welcomed the document by the Secretariat. Her delegation expressed appreciation for the views expressed by Egypt and Uganda on the subject. Although developing countries were forced to integrate into the multilateral trading system and had been ineluctably drawn into the globalization process, in electronic commerce these countries faced problems of infrastructure and other equipment problems. These problems were more acute in rural areas where the telecommunications network was not developed. The marginalization of developing countries could be further accentuated. Most of the developing countries did not have full control of the impact of electronic commerce. Regional and national seminars on the subject would be required. Considerable financial assistance would also be required.","WTCOMTDM23.pdf","Burundi, Secretariat, Egypt, Uganda"

It was felt that that several of the important issues raised in the course of the on-going debate could assist in structuring the debate at the Seminar in 1999. Furthermore, on-going parallel activities might be related and coordinated. For instance, the Council for Trade and Goods also had arranged discussions on the e-commerce.","WTCOMTDM23.pdf","Electronic, Commerce, and, Development, Council, for, Trade, and, Goods"

His delegation agreed that the paper emphasised the right aspects and highlights the salient issues to be examined by the CTD, such as the positive educational benefits. In this regard, human resource development was crucial even for the European Communities. The representative of Egypt had raised a vast set of questions, several of which were directed at the developed countries, seeking to learn from their experiences. All these questions could not be answered. However, his delegation would think about several of the questions raised. The European Communities would endeavour to present its experiences, for instance, with small and medium sized enterprises. Delegations had emphasized the vital importance of technical infrastructure. He agreed with the importance accorded to this issue. Further work was needed on this issue, including technical assistance aspects.","WTCOMTDM23.pdf","European, Communities, Secretariat, CTD, Egypt"
"1712",1712,"60","60.       The representative of Peru welcomed the Secretariat for the useful paper, which would ensure that the development dimension should be a positive contribution in the debate on e-commerce. The benefits obtained by developing countries from e-commerce would depend on how certain challenges are tackled, including access to computer infrastructure and training of human resources. Another important element was the development content, bearing in mind, cultural and linguistic diversity, referred to in paragraph 34 of the note. Efforts to face these challenges should be made by Governments which would also have to promote the active participation of the private sector. The note indicated how domestic policies could exert influence in creating an environment favourable to foreign investment, promoting private competition in domestic markets, and facilitating access to computer goods and services by means of tariff reductions. Domestic decisions which could result in specific commitments in the context of the GATS and the ITA could also facilitate this process. However, it could be questioned whether these efforts would be sufficient or whether they would need to be complemented by further efforts at the multilateral level. Having regard to the potential of e- commerce and its potential for the integration of the developing countries into the world economy, he felt that domestic policies should be integrated with international initiatives. If the WTO had a role to WT/COMTD/M/23 Page 16 play, then the document and the CTD debates could be a basis for considering the multilateral aspects of such efforts, including, inter alia, the identification of modalities for technical cooperation. Technical cooperation would be efficient in assisting developing countries to overcome access problems, problems with training, and initiating development content in e-commerce as well as financial resources that would be required for such efforts.","WTCOMTDM23.pdf","Peru, Secretariat, GATS, ITA, WTO"

The representative of Uruguay welcomed the Secretariat paper and expressed appreciation to the delegations of the United States, Uganda, Norway and Egypt, for their valuable comments. Paragraphs 29, 30 and 32 on physical infrastructures contained concrete Secretariat suggestions to developing countries as to how to improve access to telecommunications, through reduction or elimination of tariffs for hardware or software, and improving developing country commitments under the GATS and the ITA (a plurilateral Agreement). However, there was no clear identification of the type of contributions, inputs or experiences that developed countries would give to developing countries in e-commerce. Paragraph 43 of the Secretariat Paper, relating to the revenue implications for developing countries from the use of e-commerce, referred to recent WTO Secretariat research on which it would be useful to have further information. Paragraph 44 noted that taxation of electronic transmissions is not impossible and that different methods of doing so were being studied by governments. He asked what was included under the concept of electronic transmissions. Referring to paragraph 48 on legal matters, he agreed that there must be a legal framework because the growth and development of e-commerce were intimately linked with the need to ensure legal security and privacy. In this regard, it would be useful to cooperate with international organizations in this area such as UNCITRAL, UNCTAD and others.","WTCOMTDM23.pdf","Uruguay, Secretariat, United, States, Uganda, Norway, Egypt, Secretariat, GATS, Secretariat, WTO, Secretariat, UNCITRAL, UNCTAD"
"1709",1709,"58","58.      The representative of Uganda welcomed the Secretariat paper. His delegation recognized that e-commerce was a phenomenon that had come to stay and was irreversible. However, the pace of evolution of e-commerce was considerable, and beyond the level of development and the capacity of many developing countries, in particular the least-developed countries. This situation made it imperative to address the needs faced by developing countries and to address those problems which hampered their ability to take advantage of e-commerce. The biggest problem regarding e-commerce which developing countries had to grapple with in the short and medium-term was the problem of weak and poor physical infrastructure, notably in the areas of energy and telecommunications. As contained in the Secretariat paper, the availability of good infrastructure was a prerequisite for benefitting from e-commerce. Good infrastructure was lacking in many developing countries especially the LDCs. He stated that in Uganda, power supply, telephones, fax and internet facilities were scarce, concentrated in urban areas, unreliable and expensive. Recently, the Ugandan government had liberalized the telecommunications sector and the results were encouraging. This problem of poor infrastructure in developing countries had to be addressed in order to level the playing field. He called on the international community to assist developing countries in this area. Similar assistance was also required in the development and improvement of human infrastructure requirements for e-commerce, technology transfer, etc.","WTCOMTDM23.pdf","Uganda, Secretariat, Secretariat, Uganda"

EDI was a proprietary information system developed exclusively for the use of select users. To the contrary, the Internet was an open system which could be used by services- providers around the globe to share information. Some developing countries appeared to have specified in law that the only system that could be used for customs purposes was the UNCTAD developed EDI system. The United States believed that it was unwise to stipulate the sole use of any particular technology. It was better to permit the use of the best technology as determined by the market-place. In paragraph 21, the Secretariat provided statistics which give a snapshot of the Internet today, which revealed the United States in an overwhelmingly dominant position. However, future data should show a declining trend of U.S. dominance of the Internet, and show increasing use in the developing world. The data provided by the representative of Egypt assisted in indicating the direction of use. In 1995, the number of users in Africa was small but in just a few years, the number had increased significantly. The U.S. was keen to see a steady increase in Internet use in Africa. It was also interesting to note that several developing countries were increasing Internet use.","WTCOMTDM23.pdf","UNCTAD, United, States, Secretariat, United, States, U.S., Egypt, Africa, U.S., Africa"

She highlighted several issues; a defining feature of e-commerce was access to networks to provide the band-width needed to advance e-commerce services. Access included providing for competition and regulation in network services, including the terms and conditions for interconnection and in favour of new entrants. Investment was initially important, particularly in technical and human resources. Investment in infrastructure could be encouraged through regimes that guarantee non-discriminatory treatment for companies.","WTCOMTDM23.pdf","United, States, Secretariat"
"1702",1702,"51","51.     The representative of Egypt expressed appreciation to the Secretariat for the interesting paper. He drew attention to paragraph 2 of the Secretariat Note, which stated that it was a first step to address the issues in a preliminary manner. He raised a number of issues which he hoped that the Secretariat would address in future revisions or elaborations to the Note, which he hoped could be produced soon. He addressed a series of specific issues, as follows:         -       More attention needed to be accorded to the use of information technology to                 integrate developing countries in the multilateral trading system, contained in the                 third bullet point of the mandate from the General Council to the CTD. Not all trade                 problems of developing countries could be solved by e-commerce. However,                 attention should be given to how e-commerce in particular, and information                 technology in general, could be used to solve some of these problems, particularly at                 a time when the share of developing countries in global trade was declining.         -       Additional analysis was required from the Secretariat on investment requirements for                 e-commerce, and the costs faced by developing country firms in using e-commerce,                 as noted in paragraph 14 of the Note.         -       The relationship between rural and urban areas in developing countries and its effect                 on telecommunications density required further analysis.         -       Further work was required on the issue of revenue allocation and duties, which were                 briefly addressed in paragraphs 43 and 44. It would be desirable to determine how                 significant duties were in specific terms and in specific countries and to estimate how                 liberalization would affect revenues and their effects whether positive or otherwise.         -       Legal issues (paragraph 35) were also important and required further work,                 particularly questions relating to taxation in relation to e-commerce.         -       Issues regarding the substitution effect of e-commerce in trade of developing                 countries also required further study.         -       Further analysis should be made on the effects of e-commerce on inter-firm relations                 and how supply and demand would be affected on a disaggregated level. Related to                 this would be the possible effects of e-commerce on competition at the sectoral level.         -       The difficult issue of statistics should be incorporated into future discussions. It                 would be useful if an elaborated Secretariat Note would present how statistical issues                 are to be dealt with.

More detailed work was needed on the human resource needs of     developing countries in e-commerce. To this end, innovative solutions and success     stories should be emphasised. He called on the delegations of developed countries to     share their experiences in e-commerce with developing countries. Many of these     experiences could be shared because, for instance, small and medium size enterprises     in developing countries would have a lot in common with comparable enterprises in     developed countries. Another area where experiences could be shared because of the     cross-cutting character was in signatures where experience was illuminating and     innovative and could be shared with others. Yet another area was fraud on the     internet, and ancillary issues pertaining to jurisdictional questions. -   Further analysis was needed on the possibility of designing market solutions to policy     challenges, and the relationship between private sector development and     governmental regulation, particularly for development purposes. This was a     controversial area. His delegation should like to see these issues addressed. -   The Secretariat, in a future note might assist developing countries in weighing various     public policy options. Paragraph 29 of WT/COMTD/W/51 offered a good example     of the price of telecommunications. It indicated that developing countries should     strive to reduce the price of telecommunications, but to an extent might still provide     incentives to foreign investors to be attracted to these countries. A trade-off was,     therefore, apparent. The variables pertinent to such trade-offs required elaboration. -   The issue of intermediaries in e-commerce required further analysis in the light of     their potential effects on transactional costs. On this issue, various views existed.     Some have argued that these intermediaries may disappear, but that other forms of     intermediaries (cybermediaries) may appear. -   The degree of penetration of e-commerce in different sectors also required further     analysis. For example, it would be useful to know why some sectors, for example,     the services sector, had experienced deeper penetration by e-commerce than others.     The results of such analysis would have signficant policy implications for developing     countries. In the services sector, the effects of e-commerce on the movement of     natural persons would also require closer analysis. The larger issue would be to     understand how e-commerce would affect Members obligations and commitments in     the GATS. It was possible that commitments could be stretched because some of the     transactions undertaken by governments may not be detected even though the same     Members had undertaken specific commitments in this area. Concern had been     expressed as to the potential of e-commerce for undermining the protection that some     developing countries accord domestic producers in specific sectors. -   The issue of infrastructure: physical infrastructure, e-commerce infrastructure, and     the governance of the internet, was important and also required further analysis. -   E-commerce in the LDCs and in Africa required special attention. African     connectivity rates was one specific issue which could be further studied; for instance,     in 1995 only four African countries had full internet connectivity, while at present,     this had increased to about 47 countries. His delegation hoped that this progress     would continue, although telecommunications infrastructure in Africa was low and     weak. In recognition of the low levels of connectivity and low levels of     telecommunications infrastructure, the World Bank had recommended that Africa     should increase its connectivity levels from a rate of five lines per 1,000 to at least WT/COMTD/M/23 Page 14                 five lines per 100. This would require substantial investments by governments in                 developing countries before this recommended level can be achieved.","WTCOMTDM23.pdf","Egypt, Secretariat, Secretariat, Note, Secretariat, General, Council, CTD, Secretariat, Secretariat, Secretariat, Members, Members, Africa, Africa, World, Bank, Africa"
"1701",1701,"50","50.      His delegation concluded that to enhance the use of e-commerce, developing countries should focus on enhancing physical infrastructure;             proceed with regulatory      reform of the telecommunications sector; allow private competition in the telecommunications sector; develop supportive domestic legislation and regulations for the use of e-commerce; ensure low duty access for computer equipment; invest in education, including primary education. The private sector should be the driving force on how to utilise the potential presented by e-commerce.","WTCOMTDM23.pdf",""
"1700",1700,"5","5.      The Chairman of the SCLDC clarified that the two documents would be submitted to assist the discussions in the General Council. This did not imply that the SCLDC had completed the WT/COMTD/M/23 Page 2 consideration of the two documents. No further discussions of the issues were therefore precluded either in the SCLDC or in the CTD.","WTCOMTDM23.pdf","Chairman, General, Council, CTD"
"1699",1699,"49","49.     First, the availability of physical infrastructure should be enhanced for conducting e-commerce. The regulatory environment and the price of telecommunications services were import Widespread access to telecommunications was essential. In order to attain this objective, governments should focus on regulatory reforms and allow private competition in the telecommunications sector with the aim of reducing and keeping low the price of telecommunications. Governments should abstain from using the telecommunications as a major revenue earner for the government. Duty free or low duty access to computer equipment would also be important to ensure widespread access and use. Second, governments should invest in education, not just in higher education, but also in primary and secondary education. Widespread access to telecommunications could facilitate low-cost distance learning via the Internet. In this sense, access to education and access to telecommunications services interconnected. Third, developing countries or any other country, that wished to participate actively in e-commerce must ensure that domestic laws and regulations were conducive to the use of e-commerce for trade-related communications and delivery. According to the Secretariat's paper, developing countries have so far made few legislative reforms that would accommodate the requirements for e-commerce. Fourth, governments should avoid narrow sectoral approaches in choosing measures for building national capacity for e-commerce. Electronic commerce had the potential for system-wide and cross-sectoral benefits. Governments WT/COMTD/M/23 Page 12 should not attempt to pick ""winners"" (national champions), for instance, in trying to invest and develop particular sectors to facilitate e-commerce at the cost of others. An exception should be the educational sector where the return of earmarked investments in telecommunication access and computer equipment could be very high.","WTCOMTDM23.pdf","Secretariat"
"1698",1698,"48","48.     The representative of Norway regretted that it had not had the chance to comment on the Secretariat Paper at the Informal Consultations on 23 November 1998. He welcomed the paper for its usefulness. In the view of his delegation, the essential issue raised in the paper was the need to build up capacity in developing countries so that they could use the opportunities presented by e-commerce as a means of conducting and facilitating trade. It was evident that e-commerce offered potential benefits for developing countries. These potential benefits were well set out in the Paper. However, what his delegation found most important was the description of what governments in developing countries should do to enhance the use of the internet. In this regard, he highlighted some of the issues discussed in the paper.","WTCOMTDM23.pdf","Norway, Secretariat"
"1697",1697,"47","47.     The Chairman said that the main item for discussion was the Secretariat paper on the Development Implications of Electronic Commerce, contained in document WT/COMTD/W/51. He recalled that at the Informal Consultations of the CTD on 23 November, Members, in preliminary reactions, had welcomed the paper and expressed satisfaction with its scope and content. While expressing their wish to further analyze the paper, Members had emphasised, inter alia, the fine balance in the paper between the potential benefits of electronic commerce and the problems faced by developing countries.","WTCOMTDM23.pdf","Chairman, Secretariat, Development, Implications, of, Electronic, Commerce, CTD, Members, Members"

The representative of Mauritius expressed appreciation to all Members who had intervened, and particularly to those who had supported the concerns and problems of small economies. He joined the representative of Barbados in supporting the proposal by Egypt. Before the next meeting, his delegation, after consultations with other Members, intended to outline how they saw the process evolving. His delegation sought the assistance of the Secretariat in guiding the CTD on this item. Against the background of his experience as former Chairman of the CTD, the representative of Mauritius assured the representative of Switzerland that the evolution of work under the item on small economies was intended to benefit the CTD.","WTCOMTDM23.pdf","Mauritius, Members, Barbados, Egypt, Members, Secretariat, CTD, Chairman, CTD, Mauritius, Switzerland, CTD"
"1694",1694,"44","44.      The representative of Barbados, speaking a second time, supported the proposal by Egypt and others, to request the Secretariat to prepare an analytical paper on issues relevant to the impact on trade of smallness and vulnerability. She proposed that the Secretariat should conclude the analytical paper within a short time-frame so that it could be used in the preparatory process for both the 3rd WTO Ministerial Conference and the next Round of negotiations. While her delegation agreed that some further brainstorming was necessary to clarify the issues, it was certain that Members, including her delegation, would cooperate for any clarification that would be required.

Her delegation encouraged other Members to share their concerns, difficulties and problems with Members of the CTD. This was a very useful exercise. The proposals made in the course of the meeting were constructive. Proposals by Egypt, India and Brazil were all worth considering. Her delegation agreed that the consideration of the concerns and problems small economies should focus on the trade dimensions. Her delegation supported further work on the role of the CTD in addressing these problems.","WTCOMTDM23.pdf","Canada, Members, Members, CTD, Egypt, India, Brazil, CTD"
"1692",1692,"42","42.      The representative of Panama understood the concerns expressed by representatives who had spoken previously. She sought possible solutions, for instance, to ensure better and improved market access for small economies. She agreed with the representative of Morocco that special and differential treatment provisions should be used, and that the WTO should work with other international organizations on this objective. If a list of studies were drawn up on the concerns and problems of small economies, it would be obvious that the problems had been identified and actions/measures also proposed as solutions. It was now time for the CTD to find and agree to the appropriate mechanism to ensure that these actions are effectively applied. Countless documents and studies existed. Future WTO negotiations were approaching. Her delegation considered that the CTD should work together in partnership to ensure that solutions were found. There was a need to strengthen the resources and capacities of small economies so that they could participate more fully in the multilateral trading system.","WTCOMTDM23.pdf","Panama, Morocco, WTO, CTD, WTO, CTD"
"1691",1691,"41","41.      His delegation had noted the re-affirmation that technical cooperation had to be needs driven. Full implementation of this principle would provide an avenue to respond to some of the concerns raised in WT/COMTD/W/50 and Corr.1. Nonetheless, his delegation recognized that there were other broad policy issues and discussions that would be required. In thinking about further work, his delegation agreed with the positions taken by Brazil, the European Communities, Switzerland and Uruguay namely, that it would be useful to focus on the trade dimension of the subject, the concerns, problems and issues raised; and then determine what could be done within the existing rules-based system.","WTCOMTDM23.pdf","Corr, Brazil, Switzerland, Uruguay"
"1690",1690,"40","40.     The representative of Australia welcomed the papers and expressed appreciation to Mauritius, Guatemala, Fiji and others who had indicated that they would present papers on their specific national concerns and experiences. The papers so far were useful contributions that outlined specific concerns about their capacities to participate in and take advantage of trade liberalization and the multilateral framework of trade rules. His delegation agreed that the WTO should be sensitive to the individual development needs of its Members. This would require identifying particular problems faced by developing country WTO Members, and determining the scope for WTO action to respond to these problems. There was a role, therefore, for the CTD and the Sub-Committee on Least-Developed Countries in the discussions under this item. The papers currently before the CTD were timely reminders to focus the discussions on the specific concerns and circumstances of Members. Members needed to keep in mind the issues raised in the papers such as technical cooperation, trade facilitation, electronic commerce and the implementation of special and differential treatment provisions in WTO Agreements.","WTCOMTDM23.pdf","Australia, Mauritius, Guatemala, Fiji, WTO, Members, WTO, Members, WTO, CTD, CTD, Members, Members, WTO"

He wanted to know if the document would not first be discussed in the CTD. Furthermore, regarding the non- paper to be prepared by the Secretariat on observations made by Members in the course of the SCLDC exchange of views on the market access paper, he wondered how this document would be prepared and how it would be submitted to the General Council.","WTCOMTDM23.pdf","Mexico, CTD, Secretariat, Members, General, Council"
"1688",1688,"39","39.      The representative of Uruguay welcomed the paper on the concerns and problems of small economies. He encouraged others to detail their own national experiences. Following the suggestions by the representatives of the European Communities and India, his delegation would exclusively focus on trade issues. First, he recalled the Secretariat study on special and differential treatment in WTO Agreements. An important feature of special and differential treatment provisions was the longer transitional time-frames provided for small economies and for developing countries for them to adapt to or comply with the provisions of WTO Agreements. This provision was important. Market access was an equally important issue. In this connection, when ""special and differential"" provisions were introduced, the intention was to improve market access of developing countries in general. It was apparent to his delegation that market access was still incomplete. Market access was an important issue, and it would be a valuable contribution if the WTO could effectively improve market access conditions both for small economies and for developing countries in general.

"1687",1687,"38","38.      He noted several conceptual issues. First, he supported the approach for proceeding as suggested by the representative of Brazil and others. If there was to be a Secretariat paper on the subject of small economies, it should focus on the trade dimension and what was possible within the rules-based multilateral trading system to alleviate the problems. Second was the dynamic concept of development. In this regard, the representative of India had correctly noted that the size of any economy was not a dynamic concept which could be changed. Nonetheless, his delegation supported the initiative by the representative of Mauritius, and hoped that it would not have a negative effect on the other items on the agenda of the CTD.","WTCOMTDM23.pdf","Brazil, Secretariat, India, Mauritius, CTD"
"1686",1686,"37","37.     The representative of Switzerland shared the concerns of Members that had documented the vulnerability of the small economies to climatic and economic fluctuations. His delegation also understood the points made on the risks of marginalization which faced small countries other than the LDCs. His delegation was concerned about the marginalization of any country. It would be worthwhile to contribute to any effort in the WTO to reduce this risk. Recalling the views expressed by the European Communities, the CTD should focus on trade and development issues. In this regard, his delegation was uncertain as to the specific contributions the CTD could make on small economies. He was mindful of the possibility of the CTD dispersing its efforts in different directions which would ultimately reduce efforts that could be made in other areas such as in respect of LDCs, technical assistance reforms, etc. This did not imply that the concerns expressed by several small economies should not be taken seriously. On the contrary, the placement of the item on the agenda of the CTD showed that there was concern for, and accommodation of, their problems.","WTCOMTDM23.pdf","Switzerland, Members, WTO, CTD, CTD, CTD, CTD"
"1685",1685,"36","36.      He recalled that at the High-Level Meeting for LDCs in October 1997, there were 12 specific round-tables in which each country voluntarily presented its needs assessments. His delegation felt that this sort of self-focus in the determination of needs would be a good idea. In other words, small economies should produce their own needs assessments and identify in what areas these needs would be required. This model, used in the context of the HLM for LDCs, presented the possibility of a useful approach. In this regard, the paper by Mauritius was excellent. His delegation urged others to present their economic difficulties in a written form. These written needs analyses would assist the Secretariat in its own analysis. This approach would approximate the ""spirit of ownership"" which was indispensable for succeeding in development. He urged all small economies to develop this ""spirit of ownership"" of their development plans.","WTCOMTDM23.pdf","LDCs, LDCs, Mauritius, Secretariat"
"1684",1684,"35","35.     The representative of Japan considered it apparent that some concrete views were emerging in the discussions of the item. His delegation, similar to views expressed by previous delegations, understood, were sensitive to, and sympathised with, the condition of small economies.

At the same time, his delegation shared the view expressed by the European Communities that the WTO was a rule-based Organization, and therefore efforts in the item under consideration should be focused on relevant issues. Furthermore, the points made by the representative of India were worth considering.","WTCOMTDM23.pdf","Japan, Egypt, WTO, India"
"1683",1683,"34","34.     The representative of Nicaragua re-affirmed his delegation's support for, and commitment to, the multilateral trading system. Nicaragua was committed to the liberalization of its markets and to globalization. Serious commitments had been undertaken with expectations of obtaining benefits. These benefits were periodically or constantly threatened due to the size of Nicaragua's economy and the frequency of natural disasters. These factors further reduced the benefits that Nicaragua could draw from the multilateral trading system. This was why his delegation felt that the serious account should be taken of the needs that had been expressed by the small economies as the WTO began to prepare for the 3rd Ministerial Conference.","WTCOMTDM23.pdf","Nicaragua, Nicaragua, Nicaragua, Nicaragua, WTO"
"1682",1682,"33","33.      Geography could not be changed; for example, very little could be done about the fact that a country was land-locked. Thus, it would be useful for countries to focus on things that could be changed. In this regard, he would highlight four points which were pertinent for the next stage of the discussion of this item in the CTD. First was the pace of liberalization, where some Members had pointed that it would be unfair to expect LDCs and small economies to maintain the same pace of liberalization as others. The pace of liberalization would translate into commitments in a rule-based system such as the WTO. Second was the issue of market access. A paper had been submitted to the Committee and the General Council by the Sub-Committee on Least-Developed Countries. It would be useful to consider the refinement of this paper, and in doing so, to take account of the concerns of small economies. It should be recognised that market access concerns were of tremendous importance to small economies and needed to be addressed at some point in time. Third was the issue of technical assistance. Although some Members had argued that technical assistance was not the whole answer, this, however, was not equivalent to discounting technical assistance altogether. The CTD had to focus on technical assistance in order to determine whether the normal channels of technical assistance and its format were enough for small economies, and thereby determine whether a refinement was necessary. Finally, his delegation agreed with other representatives that coordination with other organizations was essential. It was evident that the concerns and problems of small economies were tackled by other organizations apart from the WTO. He supported the proposal by the representative of Egypt for a Secretariat paper on the subject.","WTCOMTDM23.pdf","CTD, Members, WTO, Committee, General, Council, Members, CTD, WTO, Egypt, Secretariat"
"1681",1681,"32","32.     The representative of India emphasised his delegation's sensitivity to, and sympathy for, the concerns and problems of small economies. He commended the initiative of the representative of Mauritius and others in circulating their papers. He agreed with the views of Egypt and Brazil that this was the time to go beyond the conceptual stage and attempt to address their concerns.","WTCOMTDM23.pdf","India, Mauritius, Egypt, Brazil"
"1680",1680,"31","31.      The representative emphasised the issue of the categories of countries. The High-Level Meeting for Least-Developed Countries (HLM) had taken place from 27 to 28 October 1997. The focus and emphasis of the HLM were still fresh in the minds of Members. Confusion should not be created by an over-emphasis on different categories of countries. It would be difficult to encompass all the criteria that had been identified under one common denominator. His delegation was open to this attempt, but doubted the possibility. It was important to bear in mind that initiatives already existed which needed follow-up and implementation. He also reminded Members that productive discussions on technical assistance were underway, and urged Members not to divert attention from these discussions, at a stage where discussions were also on-going on evaluation, and to venture into other new aspects of WTO technical assistance. He concluded that his delegation was fully aware of and sympathetic to, the issues but were unsure as to how they should be addressed in addition to the initiatives that were underway. However, his delegation was open to the maintenance of the item on the agenda and the continued discussion of the issues raised, including how initiatives or solutions which were proposed would fit into the rule-based multilateral trading system both in the CTD and in other Committees with related competencies.","WTCOMTDM23.pdf","Members, Members, Members, WTO, CTD"
"1679",1679,"30","30.      The representative of the European Communities congratulated Mauritius on its paper. His delegation attached great importance to the concerns and problems of small economies and would study the issues raised in the document very closely. The document showed that the concerned and affected economies deserved sympathy. Efforts should be made to enable these economies to fully participate in the multilateral trading system. His delegation believed that it was important to retain the item on the agenda and continue with the discussions not only in the CTD, but also in other Committees which might discuss some of the ideas generated in the discussions on the item in the CTD. Nonetheless, it was important to ensure that the discussions should stay focused on trade. In this connection, it seemed that some of the issues raised went beyond issues that could be addressed, or redressed, either in the CTD specifically or at the WTO generally. This did not imply foreclosing the debate on these issues that were not trade focused, but rather that all Members should not entertain too-high expectations given the vast spectrum of problems that had been raised. Against this background, he suggested that the first step should not be to request a note from the Secretariat on the issue, but rather for the delegations which had begun analytical work to be more precise as to what the consequences would be. For instance, precision was required as to the areas where technical assistance was required. Furthermore, the starting-point was and had to be the relationship to the rule-based multilateral trading system. In this connection, he agreed with the views expressed by the representative of Brazil. More discussions were required because he was not certain that the Secretariat could produce a background on the basis of the exchange of views so far.

Ambassador Bruun noted that the SCLDC had agreed to ask the Secretariat to prepare two non-papers, on the Secretariat's own responsibility, each containing a short structured list of the main points that emerged during the Sub-Committee's discussions of the two papers. Those lists would accompany the documents to assist further discussions under the aegis of the General Council. In accordance with of the terms of reference of the Sub-Committee, which required the Sub-Committee to report to the Committee on Trade and Development for consideration and appropriate action, the matter was being referred to the CTD for formal referral to the General Council.","WTCOMTDM23.pdf","Ambassador, Bruun, Secretariat, Secretariat, General, Council, Committee, on, Trade, and, Development, CTD, General, Council"
"1677",1677,"29","29.      The representative of Bolivia expressed satisfaction that this item was being addressed in the CTD. Its treatment demonstrated the concern of several Members for the problems of small economies. He recalled paragraph 2 of the preamble to the Marrakesh Agreement, which recognized that positive efforts should be made to ensure that developing countries, including the least-developed amongst them would secure a share in the growth of world trade commensurate with the needs of their economic development. He stressed some of the economic and trade difficulties faced by small economies like Bolivia. These included a non-diversified economic base, with considerable dependence on foreign trade; vulnerability to price fluctuations on international markets; effects of trade-dependency on domestic macroeconomic policies; major access problems in markets for their small- and medium-sized businesses; and, in Bolivia's case, serious economic consequences resulting from being land-locked. Recent studies had demonstrated that the present prejudice against Bolivia as a result of its lack of access to the sea totalled US$4 billion per decade, an amount equivalent to the total foreign debt. To improve the participation of small economies in international trade, a shared effort had to be made by all WTO Members. To this end, his delegation welcomed the proposals by the representative of Egypt that the item should be considered in the CTD on the basis of a Secretariat analysis. Technical assistance was an extremely important element, which was useful in capacity- building and in strengthening domestic trade policy institutions. Nevertheless, technical assistance was not a solution to all problems and the key matter to be addressed was improved market access for small economies.","WTCOMTDM23.pdf","Bolivia, CTD, Members, Bolivia, Bolivia, Bolivia, WTO, Members, Egypt, CTD, Secretariat"
"1676",1676,"28","28.      The representative of the United States stated its support for discussions in the CTD on the concerns and problems of small economies. Her delegation was sensitive to the problems of small economies and further recognized that every WTO Member had specific concerns related to its situation in size, income level, geographic location and other characteristics. The United States was mindful of the critical value that WTO-consistent preferences play for all developing countries, in particular LDCs, including small economies. In this regard, the United States had contributed enormously and would continue to do so in a WTO-consistent manner. In addition, the United States had also contributed to hurricane struck economies, such as the economies that had been devastated by Hurricane Mitch. However, she shared the position of Brazil regarding some of the proposals that had been made. Proposals for addressing the problems of small economies, including specific proposals for assistance had to be considered within the framework of the rule-based system and the balance of rights and obligations for Members. Proposals could also be considered within the framework of WTO technical assistance programmes.","WTCOMTDM23.pdf","United, States, CTD, WTO, Member, United, States, United, States, United, States, Mitch, Brazil, Members, WTO"
"1675",1675,"27","27.     The representative of Brazil stated its sensitivity to the problems of small economies. He welcomed the proposal to consider the item in the CTD. The difficulties raised should be addressed not only by the WTO but also by other international organizations which focused on development and financial matters. Within the framework of the CTD, his delegation considered that the examination of the item could follow a two-track approach, firstly, by further refining the concept of small economies in order to determine its conceptual fit with the rules-based system of the WTO, and secondly, as suggested by the Egyptian delegation, by discussing technical aspects of specific problems of the small economies and how these problems could be addressed by WTO technical cooperation and assistance.

The representative of Morocco recalled that one of the cardinal objectives of the WTO was to achieve the integration of all states into the multilateral trading system, in particular developing countries which were at risk of marginalization. He was aware of the problems raised for small economies largely because of the vicissitudes of climate, geography and economy. His delegation was prepared to address the problems raised by small economies within the CTD and in other bodies of the WTO. Small economies had specific problems to be addressed. It was evident that all developing countries encountered difficulties with respect to their integration into the multilateral trading system. He suggested that account could be taken of the proposals being made by sponsors of the item through special and differential treatment provisions, as suggested by Barbados. The problems could also be addressed through technical cooperation projects and other positive measures. For instance, the elimination of market access restrictions would be one of the positive measures that could be undertaken. It could also be possible to request the Secretariat to produce an analytical paper, as suggested by Egypt.","WTCOMTDM23.pdf","Morocco, WTO, CTD, WTO, Barbados, Secretariat, Egypt"

These problems had a negative impact on the trade viability of the economies in question. Natural and environmental disasters had catastrophic effects on these economies. However, he said that his delegation would have been more at ease if the document had been offered more clarity on the concept of small economies. The paper addressed the problems of small economies in a broad sense whereas paragraph 6 of the Declaration of the 2nd Ministerial Conference had only referred to ""certain small economies"". Nonetheless, the WTO should recognize the problems of small economies and address these problems. At the same time, certain issues in the paper were debatable. In this regard, his delegation cautioned on the criteria for measuring or assessing the level of development as suggested in paragraph 3 of the paper. He also hoped that small economies would support the initiative to establish an independent foundation to reduce the high costs in the use of the WTO dispute settlement system. Finally, he hoped that issues raised in the paper could be addressed within the framework of WTO provisions, as suggested in paragraph 23 of the paper.","WTCOMTDM23.pdf","Tanzania, WTO, WTO, WTO"

"1671",1671,"23","23.      The representative of Egypt supported the CTD addressing the difficulties of small economies. For his delegation, two points stood out. First, was the hope, initially raised by the representative of Tanzania in the previous meeting, that LDCs would exit the LDC category as quickly as possible. His delegation was fully associated with that hope. However, what was being noted in the statements being made on the current item were the specific difficulties that were being confronted by small economies. His delegation was convinced that more focus on the issues and difficulties facing both LDCs and small economies. Lesotho, both as an LDC and a small economy, reflected some problems common to both. The CTD should focus particularly on those trade-related problems and how they can be meaningfully addressed in the WTO. Second, a recurring issue in the discussions, so far, was the impact of the relationship between the smallness of the economies, their WT/COMTD/M/23 Page 6 vulnerability, and their competitiveness (or lack of it) in an international environment. His delegation considered that this could be an interesting and specific approach to further explore, and to study in greater detail, possibly on the basis of a paper to be prepared by the Secretariat. This approach could encompass the question of the impact of smallness, remoteness and the vulnerability of small economies on the competitiveness of the production of these economies and their trade situation. To conclude, his delegation re-emphasised the importance of addressing the difficulties of small economies, and re-expressed the hope that there would be specific and practical recommendations to address the problems raised.","WTCOMTDM23.pdf","Egypt, CTD, Tanzania, LDCs, Lesotho, CTD, WTO, Secretariat"
"1670",1670,"22","22.      In order to increase preparedness and the ability to share fully in the benefits offered by the multilateral trading system, it was clear that small developing economies must continue to apply sound macroeconomic policies, engage in efficient and rational resource allocation, and undertake appropriate institutional changes as well as improve the quality of education. This approach would enhance the opening-up of their trade, especially in the agricultural sector. The technological base had to be improved by obtaining more and newer forms of technology, and public management had to be improved. However, internal policies were insufficient to improve the level of international preparedness of small economies. International cooperation was vital and had to be enhanced. The effects of low investment due to geographical, social and economic drawbacks had to be offset. Incentives had to be provided for intra-regional investment in small economies. The development of processing industries required to be boosted. Transfer of technology was crucial. Effective and continuous market access for products of export interest for small economies was also important. In this regard, discriminatory rules of origin against products and exports from small economies had to be eliminated. The type of mechanisms that should be adopted for achieving globalization and assisting small developing economies, within the multilateral trading system, to raise their level of development, and share of the benefits from the trading system, was an open question. His country understood that continued development depended on solid and consistent policies, sustainable development and a dynamic private sector. However, the key to prosperity depended on a constant flow of productive capital, elimination of obstacles to trade in goods and services, integration into and presence in the multilateral trading system.","WTCOMTDM23.pdf",""
"1669",1669,"21","21.      Guatemala's low level of development was reflected in its low productive capacity, which limited Guatemala's capacity to achieve its objectives under the WTO. While a substantial agricultural sector existed, with adequate production commensurate to the country's manpower, there was a lower level of urbanization and insufficient development of the educational sector. Thus, the country was less prepared structurally for, and had a limited understanding of, the imperatives of the multilateral trading system. International trade was changing rapidly and small economies had difficulties in implementing and complying with commitments under WTO rules. This was further complicated by negotiation of new commitments. Internally, some were unprepared to face the challenges of the liberalization process. For instance, fiscal income in small economies depended more than in larger economies on external trade, and could only sustain a low level of external reserves. Weaknesses of small developing economies were intensified by heavy dependence on external funding, higher levels of trade openness, concentration and vulnerability in the export sector, lack of economies of scale, small internal consumption capacity, small markets, and limited influence on the structure of world prices.","WTCOMTDM23.pdf","Guatemala, Guatemala, WTO, WTO"

"1664",1664,"17","17.      She noted that the effect of small size was recognized in national economic policies. Most countries had policies specifically designed to promote the viability of small businesses or enterprises. It followed that this policy should also be applied to the global economic arena in the context of multilateral trade agreements. The multilateral trading system had to respond to the needs of all participating countries; the full participation of small states in the multilateral trading system was critical to their economic development. Different countries had different needs which had to be recognized and accommodated. Effective participation in the multilateral trading system was not a zero sum game for the world's trading partners. In this connection, her delegation welcomed and commended the measures by Mauritius, a small economy, to offer duty free access to a certain number of products originating from LDCs.","WTCOMTDM23.pdf","Mauritius"

Foreign exchange earning sectors were limited to tourism and international business services. The country's trade flows, were concentrated in two to three main markets. This market dependence was a source of vulnerability, since the growth of export trade was linked to the performance of the markets. Regarding transportation, Barbados had only one airport and 30 cargo ships which served its trading needs.","WTCOMTDM23.pdf","Barbados, Caribbean, Barbados"

Her delegation would also circulate a country paper on Barbados elaborating its characteristics as a small economy.

His delegation was not against globalization and liberalization, but against the pace with which the process was dictated by the developed economies, through the various multilateral institutions and instruments, including international financial institutions. In the view of his delegation, equity and justice were absent in the manner of application and the pace of trade liberalization. He strongly supported the debate within the WTO and its Member countries concerning the difficulties that vulnerable developing countries faced in the current pace of trade liberalization. He hoped that as a result of this awareness and debate, some positive action would ensue in the immediate future. To this end, his delegation requested that the CTD should, as a special and targeted effort, accord priority to the development of an acceptable framework within the jurisdiction of the WTO to address the concerns of least- developed and small vulnerable states with the objective of enabling them to to undertake and complete trade liberalization policies at a pace sensitive to their different stages of developments and susceptibility to climatic hazards.","WTCOMTDM23.pdf","Fiji, WTO, Member, CTD, WTO"
"1660",1660,"13","13.      The representative of Fiji, introducing the paper by his delegation (WT/COMTD/W/54) supported the statement by Mauritius on behalf of small economies. He highlighted the geographical features of Fiji; its commitment to the WTO agenda, principles and disciplines; vulnerability factors; the export sectors of sugar, canned tuna and garments; the importance of preferences; and the cost of adjustment to Fiji. He re-affirmed Fiji's commitment to the WTO agenda of trade liberalization and recognized the benefits that global economic integration could bring. However, there were specific difficulties particularly in small island economies which posed serious limitations on trade liberalization undertakings. He drew attention to several vulnerability factors that were unique to small island economies. These included: limited natural resources, small labour force, geographical fragmentation, remoteness from major markets and susceptibility to natural disasters, such as flooding and hurricanes, which were typical features of most islands in the South Pacific. He emphasized the importance of three product areas: sugar, canned tuna and garments, and stressed the importance of preferences as well as the elimination of trade restrictions for these products. The erosion of Fiji's trade preferences by the gradual dismantling of preferential trade agreements posed a real threat to its survival. Fiji was exploring alternative strategies to secure foreign exchange earnings with minimum social disruption, but this would take time. At this stage and given the peculiarities of a small island economy, Fiji could not efficiently trade on the global market without preferences, particularly those afforded under the Sugar Protocol of the Lomé Convention and with Australia under SPARTECA.

First, he noted that 1998 had been a good year in which the CTD had addressed a wide spectrum of issues, making significant progress on some issues and initiating substantive deliberations on others. If the CTD had not achieved the integration of all economies into the Multilateral Trading System in a way allowing them to derive maximal benefits, it had certainly contributed to the process. Second, the Sub-Committee on Least-Developed Countries, under the chairmanship of Ambassador Bruun, had complemented and facilitated the work of the CTD. Third, he noted that he viewed delegates attending the Sessions of the CTD as colleagues, who shared in a common responsibility of giving trade a development bias.

"1648",1648,"11","11.     The representative of Lesotho recalled that Lesotho was both an LDC and a small economy. Recalling the working paper WT/COMTD/W/50 and Corr.1 of which his delegation was a co- sponsor, he highlighted the following factors of vulnerability in Lesotho's economy.         (a)     a land-locked state: Lesotho was within the boundaries of South Africa, with                 transportation links that go through South Africa. For instance, the nearest port was                 600 kms away at Durban. This factor translated into high import costs and unit costs                 of production;         (b)     harsh climatic factors: the El Nino phenomenon had affected the pattern of rainfall,                 with adverse effects for agriculture. In a total land area of 30,350 square kilometers,                 only 9 per cent of the land was arable;                                                                                    WT/COMTD/M/23                                                                                            Page 3         (c)     crop failures: the South African Food Security Technical Assistance Unit had noted                 that Lesotho should import 301,000 tonnes of cereal to compensate for the shortfall                 in 1997-98. The Food and Agricultural Organization had also forecast a sharp                 increase in cereal imports from the 1997-98 level. As a result of crop failures, the                 Government had considered extraordinary support for farmers such as free or                 subsidized tractor services and provision of fertilizers;         (d)     limited options: Lesotho's natural resources were scarce. The principal natural                 resources of Lesotho were water and the people;         (e)     remittances from migrant workers: This was a strong link to the economy of South                 Africa. Migrant worker remittances accounted for about 40 per cent of GDP.                 However, these remittances had been declining from 1993 due to retrenchment of                 workers by South Africa. IMF data suggests a declining trend of such remittances to                 about 29 per cent in the period 1998-99. This was a further illustration of Lesotho's                 vulnerability to economic developments in South Africa;         (f)     small industrial base: Lesotho's potential was limited by various factors. The                 domestic market was small with a total population of approximately 2.1 million,                 widely dispersed in the rural areas; there was heavy reliance on imported raw                 materials and finished goods, hence a large import bill; and Lesotho could not secure                 a significant export market, resulting in more imports than exports. Economic                 difficulties were largely based on Lesotho's small industrial base, and limited product                 diversification;         (g)     Fluctuations of commodity prices: Lesotho exported mainly wool and mohair.                 However, export earnings from these were unpredictable because of frequent changes                 in commodity prices. Lesotho was a pricetaker on world markets, with adverse                 effects for FDI.","WTCOMTDM23.pdf","Lesotho, Lesotho, Corr, Lesotho, Lesotho, South, Africa, South, Africa, Durban, South, African, Food, Security, Technical, Assistance, Unit, Lesotho, Food, and, Agricultural, Organization, Lesotho, Lesotho, South, Africa, South, Africa, IMF, Lesotho, South, Africa, Lesotho, Lesotho, Lesotho, Lesotho, Lesotho"

He noted that several applicants had been awaiting a decision for a long time, and that it would be inappropriate to delay their application further by requesting additional information. He proposed that applicant organisations be invited to attend on an ad hoc basis, and that any requests for further information be made in the course of their ad hoc observer status. Noting that Observer Status was usually renewed on a meeting-by-meeting basis, any organisation that failed to meet the attendance obligation could have their status as Observer revoked.","WTCOMTDM23.pdf","Egypt, WTO, CTD, General, Council"

He highlighted possible areas of assistance to include improvements in their negotiating capacities, implementation of treaties and agreements, human capacity-building, transfer of technology, and support for SMEs, etc. He affirmed that his delegation would remain committed to the item.","WTCOMTDm22.pdf","Guatemala"
"1624",1624,"98","98.      The representative said that small economies had certain economic and structural characteristics which make them more vulnerable to external fluctuations in both production and demand. He re-iterated the point by earlier speakers that the trade of small economies depended on the exports of certain limited number of commodities. Their trade was non-diversified in structure, and did not represent a significant percentage of world trade. However, small economies were highly dependent on international trade. Furthermore, infrastructure was limited and the domestic markets were small. As widely known, many of the small economies were vulnerable to climatic disasters and hazards, such as recently tragically demonstrated by the hurricanes George and Mitch, as well as forest fires. Many of these small economies, therefore, had difficulties in drawing benefits from the multilateral trading system. As a consequence, the WTO had to be creative in evolving positive mechanisms which would assist small economies in fully participating and drawing benefits from the trading system; and also enable small economies to close the gap that separated them from other countries. Small economies must use their resources, their creativity and individual capacities, as well as those of the international community to enable them realize their development aims and potential.","WTCOMTDm22.pdf","George, Mitch, WTO"
"1623",1623,"97","97.      The representative of Guatemala said that he shared many of the points set out in the paper circulated on the Concerns and Problems of Small Economies. He felt it was justified that the Committee should keep the item on its agenda and consider it constantly because the Committee was charged with considering issues of trade and development in the multilateral trading system. His delegation recalled the concerns expressed by Trade Ministers in paragraph 6 of the 2nd WTO Ministerial Conference on the marginalization of certain small economies, and the urgency of addressing these concerns at the WTO. This was why his delegation felt it necessary to analyze the different aspects of the problems and the concerns expressed by the Ministers. In this connection, the                                                                                        WT/COMTD/M/22                                                                                               Page 21 representative of Guatemala said that his delegation would circulate a paper in the future. Nonetheless, it should be borne in mind that several organizations had already undertaken useful work on the subject of small economies. These organizations included Economic Commission for Latin America, the Organization of American States and the World Bank. In Latin America, work had also being undertaken on small economies within the purview of regionalization. Therefore, all the studies that had been carried out and which were still underway should be useful not only within the regional context, but also at the multilateral level to enable the WTO tackle this issue. Each small economy represented a series of different characteristics which pointed to the urgency of taking into account the needs of small developing economies within the WTO.","WTCOMTDm22.pdf","Guatemala, Committee, Committee, WTO, WTO, Guatemala, Economic, Commission, for, Latin, America, Organization, of, American, States, World, Bank, Latin, America, WTO, WTO"
"1622",1622,"96","96.      The representative of Cuba supported the joint paper on ""Concerns and Problems of Small Economies"". His delegation was familiar with the difficulties raised in the paper. It was necessary that the problems of the small economies should be accorded special consideration and treatment to enable them participate effectively in the multilateral trading system. The paper provided a good basis not only for the discussions in the Committee but also for the recommendations that would be evolved to meet the needs of these countries.","WTCOMTDm22.pdf","Cuba, Committee"
"1621",1621,"95","95.     She supported the position by several delegations that the jointly circulated paper was valuable. It had established a good basis for work on the item in the Committee. In conclusion, the wish of small economies was not to be marginalized; and to have an opportunity to allow their external trade function as the motor of their economies.","WTCOMTDm22.pdf","Committee"
"1620",1620,"94","94.      The representative of Bolivia acknowledged the commendation and tribute of the representatives of Jamaica and the Dominican Republic. In the real world of the multilateral trading system, small economies and other Members operated in a rule-based system. Small economies desired full participation in drawing up the rules which would govern commercial behaviour. Small economies were concerned that colleagues from LDCs had expressed so many fears. It appeared that small economies represented a danger that could arise from the diversion of attention away from LDCs. Her delegation considered that there was no competition for attention. A truly multilateral system should be able to respond to the interests of all the components of the system, particularly if such a system desired to be considered a credible system. Her delegation was deeply satisfied that this item was being addressed in the Committee. She requested that the item should be constantly retained on the agenda of the Committee. The item was not a new one. For instance, the problem had been very clearly referred to in the Committee on Subsidies and Countervailing Duties. Her delegation was convinced that a common denominator could be found to enable the Committee forge a definition which the small economies would feel correctly identified them. The aspirations of small economies should not only be concentrated on technical cooperation, which was important, but also focused on other factors which would assist the integration of small economies in the multilateral trading system. There were several examples such as the safeguarding of export opportunities, early detection of non-tariff barriers and market access for the limited exports of small economies.","WTCOMTDm22.pdf","Bolivia, Jamaica, Dominican, Republic, Members, LDCs, LDCs, Committee, Committee, Committee, Committee"
"1619",1619,"93","93.     The representative of Haiti associated his delegation with the joint paper by the six co-sponsors on ""Concerns and Problems of Small Economies"", for three reasons. First, Haiti became an LDC after having been a small island developing economy, structurally weak and WT/COMTD/M/22 Page 20 vulnerable. Second, Haiti did not want to see what happened to it, happen to other small island developing economies. Following the current trends of the world economy, these small island developing economies were potential LDCs. At the beginning of the 1980s there were only 26 LDCs, less than 20 years later, there were now 48 LDCs. This meant that with increasing globalization, the number of LDCs was increasing. If the WTO did not address the concerns of these small economies, these small economies would soon be listed as LDCs. WTO Trade Ministers at the 2nd Ministerial Conference had expressed their concern over the marginalization of LDCs and certain small economies. They recognized that this matter should be urgently addressed more so because the peculiar problems of these economies had been compounded by the problem of chronic debt. As a WTO Member and as an LDC, Haiti would like to ensure that the WTO should respond to the best of its ability to the concerns expressed by Ministers, as set out in the Declaration by the Ministers at the 2nd WTO Ministerial Conference. Irrespective of their scale of contributions, attention should be accorded to the problems of LDCs and small economies at all times.","WTCOMTDm22.pdf","Haiti, Haiti, Haiti, WTO, WTO, WTO, Member, LDC, Haiti, WTO, WTO, Ministerial, Conference"
"1618",1618,"92","92.      The representative of Tanzania suggested that either the Committee, a specialized committee or a working group should be established to work out a set of practical measures and steps for assisting small economies. His delegation believed that any supportive measure or set of measures taken to benefit any category of developing countries would in the long-run benefit all developing countries, including LDCs. His delegation reserved the right to return to the item at a later stage.","WTCOMTDm22.pdf","Tanzania, Committee"
"1617",1617,"91","91.     The representative of Tanzania stated that what was required was to identify practical ways in which these concerns could be incorporated into the WTO; and assess the impact of any practical measures of assistance on the development and the economies of these small economies. After such practical measures (action package) were undertaken, it would also be useful to know what extra impact such practical steps would have on some of the small economies that were already LDCs, such as Lesotho. In doing so, his delegation underscored the vital importance of taking account of the statements made by some of the delegations of the small economies themselves, particularly those by Jamaica and Barbados. These delegations had said that, whatever assistance sought by small economies should be without prejudice to the problems of or assistance to LDCs. On this point, the representative of Tanzania shared a common position with the representative of Bangladesh. This position was further recently affirmed by the distinguished Minister of Barbados, at the head of a delegation that was addressing the matter of the concerns and problems of small economies, and who had said: ""We pointed out that small states did not seek recognition of their special circumstances in ways which could prejudice assistance to the LDCs"". The representative of Tanzania said that whatever package of practical support the WTO put together for small economies, it would be necessary to take account of the position of non-prejudice to LDCs.","WTCOMTDm22.pdf","Tanzania, WTO, Lesotho, Jamaica, Barbados, Tanzania, Bangladesh, Barbados, Tanzania, WTO"
"1616",1616,"90","90.      He said that although LDCs also had difficulties, these were structural problems, problems related to infrastructure, under-utilisation of capacities, etc. However, the problem of LDCs were of a transitional nature. It was expected that over time, LDCs would surmount their difficulties. In contrast, the peculiarity of the problems of small economies lay in the fact of their location and their small size. The problems confronting the small economies appeared to be beyond their capacities. The case for the special consideration for small economies was, therefore, strong and Tanzania would support their case.","WTCOMTDm22.pdf","LDCs, LDCs, LDCs, Tanzania"
"1615",1615,"9","9.     The Chairman informed the            Committee     of   document WT/COMTD/W/48             dated 20 October 1998, and invited comments.","WTCOMTDm22.pdf","Chairman, Committee"
"1614",1614,"89","89.      The representative of Tanzania drew attention to the high importance to all Members of the item and commended the co-sponsors of the paper on ""Concerns and Problems of Small Economies"". The paper had just been received, therefore, his delegation's comments, at this time, would only be preliminary. Tanzania, as a Member of the Commonwealth, was participating in the Commonwealth discussions on the same item. The case for the small economies to be accorded special consideration was strong. The case had been well argued and deserved the sympathy of Members. While it was a fact that a number of these countries had higher GDP per capita than most of the LDCs, for instance Jamaica's whose GDP per capita and export earnings were twice plus that of Tanzania, yet the special nature of these countries had to be recognized. This special nature included their vulnerabilities, their remote location and smallness.","WTCOMTDm22.pdf","Tanzania, Members, Tanzania, Member, Commonwealth, Commonwealth, Members, LDCs, Jamaica, Tanzania"
"1613",1613,"88","88.     For the record, however, the representative of Bangladesh noted that the co-sponsors justified the rationale for the case for small economies from paragraph 6 of the 2nd WTO Ministerial Declaration. However, his delegation underlined the fact that the reference in the 2nd WTO                                                                                     WT/COMTD/M/22                                                                                            Page 19 Ministerial Declaration to small economies was exclusively in the context of the ""marginalization of least-developed countries"". In the absence of the context of LDCs, the concern for small economies ""lost most of its validity"". Furthermore, his delegation emphasised that the 2nd WTO Ministerial Declaration referred to ""certain small economies"" and not all small economies as had been presented by the paper in circulation. The circulated paper had severed its link to the contextual reference because it had omitted the word ""certain"". His delegation reserved its right to return to the item at a later stage.","WTCOMTDm22.pdf","Bangladesh, WTO, WTO, WTO"
"1612",1612,"87","87.      The representative of Bangladesh commended the co-sponsors for the paper circulated on ""Concerns and Problems of Small Economies"". The paper had just been received. Therefore, only general comments could be made at this time. First, the paper had introduced a new set of interesting indicators of underdevelopment, distinct from the usual and universally accepted indicator of per capita income. Second, the paper employed physical features and market characteristics in defence of its case for ""so called small economies"". The explicit attempt to re-define underdevelopment and marginalization in terms of these new indicators and features, opened the door for new interpretations which may shift the focus of the international community away from the effects of marginalization that already affected the 48 recognized LDCs. Further elaborate comments would be made after a closer examination of the paper.","WTCOMTDm22.pdf","Bangladesh"
"1611",1611,"86","86.     The representative of Egypt welcomed the paper circulated by six co-sponsors on ""Concerns and Problems of Small Economies"". His delegation took the view that difficulties presented by different developing countries should be recognized by the COMMITTEE and effectively addressed. The paper would be carefully studied. However, as a preliminary comment, the problems identified in the paper were similar to those faced by LDC's, also similar to general problems facing developing countries. However, it appeared that some of these problems were specific to small economies. His delegation was keen to further discussion of this item at a later stage.","WTCOMTDm22.pdf","Egypt, LDC"
"1610",1610,"85","85.      The representative of El Salvador joined other delegations in commending the co-sponsors of the paper on ""Concerns and Problems of Small Economies"". The paper was interesting and contained detailed contributions to a subject which was a source of concern to WTO Ministers at the 2nd Ministerial Conference. Paragraph 6 of the Declaration of the 2nd Ministerial Conference testified to the importance that the WTO Ministers attached to the subject. Her delegation felt that amongst developing countries there were characteristics that set apart small economies. Some were identifiable through their structural vulnerability to external fluctuations, and had a low share of world trade. There were those subject to frequent devastating natural disasters, climatic changes, hurricanes, such as those that had affected El Salvador. Her delegation felt that the item should remain on the agenda of the CTD so that discussions could continue and evolve at subsequent meetings.","WTCOMTDm22.pdf","El, Salvador, WTO, WTO, El, Salvador, CTD"
"1609",1609,"84","84.      The representative of Lesotho referred to the paper on ""Concerns and Problems of Small Economies"", of which Lesotho was a co-sponsor. He hoped that the document would provide a basis for constructive discussions. The issues in the paper were of crucial importance to Lesotho, and were directly linked to the efforts of his country to actively participate in the multilateral trading system. For instance, erratic and severe climatic conditions exerted considerable pressure on Lesotho's limited resources. With the limited support for small economies and LDCs, his delegation took the view that special consideration of these economies was necessary if they were to achieve full integration of their economies into the multilateral trading system. To conclude, his delegation welcomed earlier positive comments, under the preceding agenda item, for the increased and focused technical assistance for LDCs.","WTCOMTDm22.pdf","Lesotho, Lesotho, Lesotho, Lesotho, LDCs"
"1608",1608,"83","83.     Although Sri Lanka was founder Member of the GATT since 1947, the benefits that it had been able to derive from the trading system were questionable because of inherent problems confronted by Sri Lanka since the inception of the GATT. The recent financial crisis amply WT/COMTD/M/22 Page 18 demonstrated the limited extent to which countries could deal with external shocks even if they adopted ""correct"" macroeconomic policies. Many of the small economies were liberalizing their countries autonomously. They were also under tremendous pressure and burden to fulfill their obligations and commitments under various WTO Agreements. In spite of their peculiar and inherent weaknesses, small economies were required to proceed at the same speed as other developing countries. Her delegation was of the strong view that the problems of small economies needed special attention; and their unique problems required more practical solutions in order for them to able to reverse the current trends.","WTCOMTDm22.pdf","Sri, Lanka, Member, GATT, Sri, Lanka, GATT, WTO"
"1607",1607,"82","82.     The representative of Sri Lanka welcomed the placement on the Committee's agenda of the item on ""Concerns and Problems of Small Economies"", as timely and praiseworthy. Her delegation was deeply concerned with the marginalization of small economies. She urged Members of the Committee to urgently address the issue. Sri Lanka associated fully with the position expressed by Mauritius and other co-sponsors to the paper, and supported by many other speakers. The positions taken by these Members fully addressed the concerns of small economies under the current multilateral trading system. The situation of small economies was unique. They neither qualified for the special programmes for LDCs nor were they fully representative and covered in the situation that prevailed in other developing countries. For instance, FDI in these countries were at low levels because of the small size of their domestic markets and absence of well-developed infrastructures. Furthermore, these countries were heavily dependent on few primary exports for their foreign exchange earnings. Small economies had several specific problems which impeded their meaningful participation in the multilateral trading system.","WTCOMTDm22.pdf","Sri, Lanka, Committee, Members, Committee, Sri, Lanka, Mauritius, Members, LDCs"
"1606",1606,"81","81.     She also drew attention to the fact that the joint paper listed organizations and institutions which had undertaken studies on small economies and small island states. In this regard, her delegation highlighted the on-going work at UNCTAD in support of the Programme of Action adopted at the Global Conference for the Sustainable Development of Small Island Developing States. Her delegation strongly welcomed UNCTAD's cooperation with the alliance of Small Island States – a group of about 40 small island and low-lying coastal developing countries. Her delegation requested that the conclusions of UNCTAD in this area should be fed into the deliberations and work of the WTO. Trinidad and Tobago would participate in the preparation of additional papers on this item for submission to the Committee. Her delegation hoped that the concerns expressed would be taken into account in the future work of the WTO in this area.","WTCOMTDm22.pdf","UNCTAD, Small, Island, Developing, States, UNCTAD, Small, Island, States, UNCTAD, WTO, Trinidad, and, Tobago, Committee, WTO"
"1605",1605,"80","80.      The representative of Trinidad and Tobago recalled that her delegation was a co-sponsor to the circulated paper. She fully agreed with the statement made by Mauritius, Jamaica and Barbados. Her delegation was aware of the diversity that existed amongst the small island states, which were similarly affected by the same factors i.e., small size, small domestic markets, dependence on imports, heavy reliance on a few commodities and a few markets, vulnerability to natural disasters, fragility of eco-systems, constraints on transport and communications and a high level of migration of their skilled nationals. It was vital to stress that per capita income was not an adequate measure of the level of development of a country. Furthermore, it was necessary for the WTO to take account of handicaps faced by small economies to prevent the marginalization of these economies in the globalizing economy.","WTCOMTDm22.pdf","Trinidad, Tobago, Mauritius, Jamaica, Barbados, WTO"
"1604",1604,"8","8.

"1603",1603,"79","79.     The representative of Malta congratulated Mauritius and other co-sponsors for the paper on the ""Concerns and Problems of Small Economies"" and was in favour of action which took into consideration the specific needs and concerns of small economies. She referred to Maltese academic studies and the specific contributions by the University of Malta on the vulnerability indices of small economies. Her delegation was still awaiting specific instructions on the joint paper, and would make a more detailed intervention at a future meeting.","WTCOMTDm22.pdf","Malta, Mauritius, University, of, Malta"
"1602",1602,"78","78.     She noted that small economies constituted over half of the WTO membership. Therefore, her delegation believed that the WTO should, as decided at the 2nd Ministerial Meeting, initiate work to ensure that the problems and concerns specific to small economies could be recognized.","WTCOMTDm22.pdf","WTO, WTO"
"1601",1601,"77","77.     The representative of the Dominican Republic expressed gratitude to the six co-sponsors for having circulated the paper. Her delegation acknowledged the contributions of the representative of Bolivia for her important role in developing the concept of small economies. Her delegation fully supported the concept of small economies, as her country was also a small island economy subject to climate hazards such as Hurricane George which had, about a month ago, devastated Haiti, Cuba and the Dominican Republic. Conditions adding to the vulnerability of small economies included: high                                                                                     WT/COMTD/M/22                                                                                            Page 17 dependence on a few markets and few commodities, difficulties in developing the export sector, high cost of transport because of remoteness and heavy reliance on agricultural product commodities.","WTCOMTDm22.pdf","Dominican, Republic, Bolivia, Haiti, Cuba, Dominican, Republic"
"1600",1600,"76","76.     His delegation, in conclusion, emphasised that small states and their populations should not be sacrificed for doctrinal purity. Preferences were an integral part of the international trading system. They were contained in GSP and GSTP schemes operated by various countries and groupings such as the EC, NAFTA, ASEAN, CARICOM, and elsewhere. Small states, such as Dominica required preferences, over a reasonable period, to assist adjustment and facilitate the application of measures which would produce a strong economy.","WTCOMTDm22.pdf","GSP, EC, NAFTA, ASEAN, CARICOM, Dominica"
"1599",1599,"75","75.      Dominica was a small country with a population of 100,000. Half of the population were of school age or below, senior citizens or a further quarter were not gainfully employed. It was difficult to conceive what a workforce of 25,000 could competitively produce and trade in vis-à-vis other larger economies in the trading system. Nonetheless, Dominica would not despair as it was taking action to put in place measures prescribed by the WTO, the World Bank, the IMF, and others, with a view to re-structuring the domestic economy so that, in time, Dominica would be able to take its place with the rest of the world. However, a sufficient period of adjustment and transition were required, as well as, technical, financial and other forms of assistance were also required to put in place prescribed measures.","WTCOMTDm22.pdf","Dominica, Dominica, WTO, World, Bank, IMF, Dominica"
"1598",1598,"74","74.     The representative of Dominica said that if preferences were ""insensitively removed"", then these small states would be condemned to poverty, destitution and hopelessness. This was beginning to happen in Dominica as a result of its experience in banana exports in recent months and due to young farmers leaving the industry. However, these farmers were not entering into any other productive sectors or occupation – ""they were standing at street corners"". Actions being taken at the WTO were undermining the basis for peace, security, democracy and human rights in small states. Dominica could not compete on equal terms with other economies in the global system, which was evident from this statement.","WTCOMTDm22.pdf","Dominica, Dominica, WTO, Dominica"
"1597",1597,"73","73.      He noted that notions of per capita income could be misleading. Although most small states, including Dominica, had relatively statistically high per capita incomes, there were other factors beyond them. First, were remittances from migrants. These remittances were not sustainable in the long-run. A characteristic of small economies was that they spent a high proportion of their income on the provision of education, but their incomes were neither large enough nor growing at sufficiently rapid rates to absorb the products of the educational system. As a consequence, the products of these educational systems travelled abroad. However, because of reduced immigration opportunities, ""external financing"" from immigrant remittances, was decreasing. Second, were preferences, as the key factor for a relatively statistically high per capita incomes. Most small states, including Dominica, depended on preferences for entering into the world economy with a limited number of agricultural exports.","WTCOMTDm22.pdf","Dominica, Dominica"
"1596",1596,"72","72.     The representative of Dominica associated his delegation with the co-sponsors of the paper. It was not necessary to re-state the self-evident arguments for a special consideration of small states which was recognized by Ministers at the 2nd Ministerial Conference. What was now required was for the Committee to advance the process and indicate how mechanisms could be established that would WT/COMTD/M/22 Page 16 give effect to the decision of the 2nd Ministerial Conference. Action was urgent because small states were [""hurting"". This term was emotive, but indeed small states were] ""hurting"" because they were not yet in a position to take advantage of all the possibilities that they understood globalization and liberalization offered. If these trends continued and if small states remained unable to take advantage of these trends, then they would add to the list of ""failed states"". Members needed to be reminded that these states, at great sacrifice to themselves and their populations, had undertaken far-reaching reform measures. In spite of these measures, these states had not yet been able to participate in or benefit from the flows of international finance, investments and trade.","WTCOMTDm22.pdf","Dominica, Committee, Members"
"1595",1595,"71","71.      The representative of Barbados stated that the alleviation of vulnerability was possible. If the international community assisted, including the WTO, it would be possible for small economies to mitigate the constraints and the problems that confront them. Most WTO Members had already subscribed to the concept of the special vulnerability of small states in one forum or another. It was now time, therefore, for the WTO itself to become an arbiter of fairness on this matter. The rules governing the multilateral trading system must not be insensitive to the imperatives of equitable international development. A need existed for the adoption of enlightened policies which would prevent the further economic marginalization of small economies.","WTCOMTDm22.pdf","Barbados, WTO, WTO, Members, WTO"
"1594",1594,"70","70.      She further emphasised that the special circumstances of small states and the concepts of smallness and vulnerability had been accepted and were pivotal to work in various fora such as at the ACP, the EC, UNCTAD, the Commonwealth Secretariat, the FTAA, the United Nations, IMF and the Inter-American Development Bank. These organizations had incorporated into their analytical work processes the concept that small states have special vulnerabilities. In July 1998, a Commonwealth Ministerial Mission on Small States led by the Prime Minister of Barbados undertook a series of visits to major multilateral agencies in order to place the concerns of small states on the multilateral agenda. The Mission had fruitful discussions with the U.S. State Department, the IMF, the World Bank, the WTO, UNCTAD, and the European Commission. A result of the Ministerial Mission was the establishment of a World Bank/Commonwealth Task Force which was given the mandate to undertake a detailed examination of the special circumstances facing small economies with a view to devising a universally acceptable vulnerability index, and to designing more appropriate assistance programmes to meet the particular concerns of small states. The IMF, UNCTAD, the European Commission, and the WTO had all indicated their wish to contribute to the work of the Task Force. The Task Force would hold its first substantive meeting in London on 7 December 1998. The Task Force would meet in conjunction with an Advisory Group which would include representatives of governments and the private sector, regional organizations and financial institutions. It was envisaged that this Task Force and Advisory Group would hold three substantive meetings before submitting a report to the Development Committee meeting of the World Bank and the IMF which would be held in Spring 1999.","WTCOMTDm22.pdf","ACP, EC, Commonwealth, Secretariat, FTAA, United, Nations, IMF, Inter-American, Development, Bank, Barbados, U.S., State, Department, IMF, World, Bank, WTO, UNCTAD, European, Commission, IMF, UNCTAD, European, Commission, WTO, Task, Force, London, Task, Force, Advisory, Group, Task, Force, and, Advisory, Group, Development, Committee, World, Bank, IMF"

The fact had been demonstrated most recently in the global and systemic effects of the Asian financial and monetary crisis. In order to ensure the strength of the global system, the stability of the separate components should be assured. Against this background, therefore, the unique vulnerabilities of small economies should be addressed. Small economies were marginalized in the globalizing world economy because full account had not been taken of the full extent of their vulnerabilities. For instance, the use of the GDP per capita income as a benchmark for differentiation was a blunt instrument. Her delegation welcomed recent indications that international financial institutions would be reviewing this criterion. New criteria and measures must be devised that could be effectively used to meaningfully differentiate amongst countries in the allocation of resources. To this end, work should be accelerated in different fora to develop vulnerability indices designed to provide a broader measure of development for small states.","WTCOMTDm22.pdf",""
"1591",1591,"68","68.     Recognition of the circumstances of small economies should not be judged at the expense of other developing countries. The special vulnerability of some small states was a matter of enduring                                                                                     WT/COMTD/M/22                                                                                            Page 15 financial and economic distress for these countries. The recent damage by Hurricanes George and Mitch had served to underline the vulnerability occasioned by geographical location. The devastation caused by these hurricanes and other natural disasters had wiped out, in hours, economic growth achieved over many years. There would be lasting effects on the countries affected, some of whom were still re-building from the damages caused by earlier hurricanes.","WTCOMTDm22.pdf","George, Mitch"

Her delegation agreed with the specific problems of small economies as highlighted by the representative of Mauritius, and as outlined in the paper by six co-sponsors before the Committee. These problems and constraints included, but were not limited to: (a) physical and geographical attributes; extreme vulnerability to natural disasters; (b) heavy reliance on the sustained good economic performance of the rest of the world, because of the open nature and fragility of small economies; and the smallness of their domestic markets; (c) restrictions faced in the pursuit of economic diversification; (d) high dependence on international trade and foreign investments; and (e) barriers to access of official and private capital flows.","WTCOMTDm22.pdf","Barbados, Mauritius, Committee"

"1588",1588,"65","65.     The representative of Jamaica recognized the efforts of the representatives of Bolivia, Guatemala, El Salvador, Dominican Republic, Cuba and others in ensuring that attention was accorded to small economies. For several reasons, his delegation believed that small economies at the WTO required close and special attention. First, the criteria for ""graduation"" as applied at the World Bank were neither on efficient nor equitable. Consequently, measures which bound small economies to standards of obligations without recognizing their particular characteristics were deleterious to the efficiency and equity of their participation in the multilateral trading system. The valuable papers that had been circulated on special and differential treatment and the paper on small economies circulated by six co-sponsors represented initial efforts to integrate the concerns and problems of small economies as part of the Member-specific special and differential treatment provisions of the WTO Agreements. His delegation believed that all developing countries should seek to become mature economies, but to do so in a way that was consistent with their possibilities.","WTCOMTDm22.pdf","Jamaica, Bolivia, Guatemala, El, Salvador, Dominican, Republic, Cuba, WTO, World, Bank, WTO"
"1587",1587,"64","64.      His delegation recognized the work being undertaken by the Commonwealth, the IMF and the World Bank on the issue of small economies. The World Bank deserved special mention because the Prime Minister of Barbados had led a special delegation to several intergovernmental organizations including the WTO to state the concerns of small economies. These small economies made up more than half of the WTO. Small economies understood that a common set of rules and disciplines were required at the WTO, they did not desire a ""second eleven playing field"". They believed that integration in the global economy required that their economies had a place on the same playing field. Small economies were convinced that special attention was necessary to address their problems and vulnerabilities considering that it had become necessary for systemic measures to be taken even for large economies given the recognition in the international monetary system that large economies required special attention given their structural characteristics and their failure to adjust to external financial crisis. Consequently, small economies should not be ignored simply because individually they did not have the same or equivalent systemic effects. The systemic effects of trade distortions and external shocks across the length and breadth of small economies should not be ignored.","WTCOMTDm22.pdf","Commonwealth, IMF, World, Bank, World, Bank, Barbados, WTO, WTO, WTO"
"1586",1586,"63","63.      The representative of Jamaica began by according full recognition to the special position of least-developed countries (LDCs) among the developing countries, and the priority attention to be accorded to LDCs. His delegation was deeply saddened by the tragic consequences and after effects of Hurricane Mitch and the havoc it had wreaked on the region of Latin America and the Caribbean: whole crops had been wiped out which would have been harvested for exports. Recovery would take time and would be difficult. This situation was a familiar one for the Caribbean region. Based on this situation of vulnerability to external shocks, his delegation was hopeful that WTO Members would show sympathy and understanding. His delegation expressed full solidarity with affected countries and hoped that the effects of the natural disasters of hurricane and flooding would be overcome in the WT/COMTD/M/22 Page 14 region, and that any special measures required would be taken. The connection between trade and development was evident from the situation prevalent in the Caribbean and for small economies. Small economies had made enormous efforts in the past few years to bring their economies into conformity with WTO obligations. The Caribbean countries and banana exporting countries, just like other small economies, wanted to ensure a degree of certainty for and value from their exports. However, these objectives had now been disrupted because of the consequences of the hurricane and other natural disasters.","WTCOMTDm22.pdf","Jamaica, Mitch, Latin, America, Caribbean, Caribbean, WTO, Members, Caribbean, WTO, Caribbean"
"1585",1585,"62","62.      The representative of Mauritius emphasised additional points. Most Members of the WTO were also Members of the United Nations (UN); and this issue of small economies had been addressed over a long period at the UN. Furthermore, some WTO Members were also Members of the Commonwealth; and the Commonwealth similarly was in forefront in addressing this issue. Many studies had been carried out on small economies, particularly on small island economies, by organizations such as UNCTAD and others. It was, therefore, important for the Committee to take up this issue and the challenge that it posed in keeping with the decision by Trade Ministers at the 2nd Ministerial Conference; and, in doing so, to enable the General Council to submit appropriate recommendations to WTO Ministers at the 3rd Ministerial Conference, on how to address the problems of small economies.","WTCOMTDm22.pdf","Mauritius, Members, WTO, Members, United, Nations, UN, UN, WTO, Members, Members, Commonwealth, UNCTAD, Committee, General, Council, WTO"
"1584",1584,"61","61.      He underscored the concern of the paper's co-sponsors for the erosion of the competitiveness of small economies due to the absence of Foreign Direct Investment (FDI). Current uncertainty of the scope of market access for the small economies had made FDI elusive and uncertain. Small economies had undertaken obligations at Marrakesh, which were neither questioned nor reneged on. However, in the short term, the fulfilment of WTO obligations was hampered by financial, human and institutional resource limitations. In signing the Marrakesh Agreement, small economies were not aware of these resource limitations vis-à-vis their obligations. They had hoped that the benefits accruing from the multilateral trading system and the provisions on special and differential treatment in WTO Agreements would assist small economies in overcoming these constraints and limitations. The multilateral trading system had produced overall results, but it was felt by small economies that their marginalization was caused by their inability to secure a share in the growth of international trade commensurate with the needs of their economic development. Having regard to the foregoing, the Committee was confronted with a major task. Economic growth needed to be accelerated. The acceleration of economic growth would facilitate small economies' integration into the multilateral trading system on a sustainable basis.","WTCOMTDm22.pdf","Marrakesh, WTO, WTO, Committee"
"1583",1583,"60","60.     The international system was undergoing dynamic which had entailed incessant changes. Only a few countries could keep pace with these changes; many countries had limited capacity for adjustment to changes. The challenges of adjustment to these changes were more problematic for small economies because of their smallness and limited capacity, geographical situation, vulnerability to external shocks and the vagaries of nature. The vulnerability of these small economies to exogenous factors was exacerbated by their high degree of openness which compounded their economic fragility.","WTCOMTDm22.pdf",""
"1582",1582,"6","6.       The Chairman said that the Secretariat had made good progress on the paper, but required more time because of the need for further internal consultations and coordination which were required. He reminded the Committee that two useful documents on electronic commerce were already available namely, the Working Paper submitted by Egypt, and the Special Study by the Secretariat on Electronic Commerce. The Chairman urged the Secretariat to circulate the paper by mid-November. This would make it possible for the Committee to have substantial discussions on the issue at its next meeting.","WTCOMTDm22.pdf","Chairman, Secretariat, Committee, Egypt, Secretariat, on, Electronic, Commerce, Chairman, Secretariat, Committee"
"1581",1581,"59","59.     The representative of Mauritius, referring to the joint paper, recalled that Trade Ministers, at the 2nd Ministerial Conference of the WTO, had expressed deep concern on the marginalization of small economies and had recognized the need for the issue to be urgently addressed. To this end, and                                                                                   WT/COMTD/M/22                                                                                          Page 13 pursuant to paragraph 9 of the Geneva Ministerial Declaration, Mauritius had raised this issue at the second Informal Intersessional Meeting of the General Council, with a view to examining this issue and forwarding recommendations to the 3rd Ministerial Conference. Having tabled the issue before the General Council, the co-sponsors considered it a duty to place the issue on the agenda of the Committee because suggestions had been made that some of the issues should be delegated to subsidiary bodies without, however, disputing the primacy of the General Council. His delegation recognized that Committee Members required more time to study the paper, since it had only been circulated just before the meeting.","WTCOMTDm22.pdf","Mauritius, WTO, Mauritius, General, Council, General, Council, Committee, General, Council, Committee, Members"

Second, stress should be placed on disseminating information to countries because public opinion in various countries needed information on the WTO. Third, internal coordination and inter-Ministerial coordination should be a key aspect of the questionnaires to be forwarded to countries. This coordination should focus on information-sharing amongst various ministries and sectors.","WTCOMTDm22.pdf","Senegal, WTO"
"1577",1577,"55","55.       Criteria for evaluation should be simple, objective, transparent and practical. In the course of the evaluation, account should be taken of qualitative and quantitative criteria. However, quantitative criteria, such as the number of activities could be misleading. For instance, some seminars had low participation rates. However, an indicator such as respect for notification obligations was a good indicator that measured the degree of a country's awareness of such obligations as well as the absorption of assistance received.","WTCOMTDm22.pdf",""
"1576",1576,"54","54.     He also said that further consideration should be accorded to the proposal that former staff Members could be used as evaluators because of their familiarity with the WTO. While advantages were evident, disadvantages could also arise as evaluation by these former staff Members could be ""in-house"" evaluation. This proposal had to be further examined.","WTCOMTDm22.pdf","Members, WTO, Members"
"1575",1575,"53","53.      He said that external expertise would be required in the evaluation of technical cooperation programmes in the beneficiary countries, since this would relate to a judgement on concrete elements. The example of customs services was a specific area where external evaluation would determine whether the implementation of a technical assistance programme had improved the customs service in a country. The scope of evaluation should be comprehensive to cover all technical cooperation activities whether financed through the regular budget or through Trust Funds. A formula should be found to satisfy donors whose main concern was that there should be an objective evaluation. For evaluation involving joint technical assistance between the WTO and other organizations, there should be a specially adapted evaluation to the original aspects of the programme in question.","WTCOMTDm22.pdf","WTO"
"1574",1574,"52","52.      On the evaluation of training programmes, he noted that the Secretariat had faced a number of difficulties. An example, was the difficulty faced in the choice of candidates for the training courses, which was in the hands of beneficiary countries. Some of the difficulties turned on the fact that sometimes beneficiary countries sent the same officials to the various training courses, and sometimes lacked various elements for measuring the impact of the assistance programmes on recipient countries. In this regard, some of the problems which were rooted in the exercise of state sovereignty were difficult to solve. Training was important. In the evaluation of WTO training programmes, he WT/COMTD/M/22 Page 12 considered that it would be up to the Secretariat, Member States and the trainees, to consider the objectives that had been set and to regularly assess the content of the training courses, the quality of the support materials used, and the educational approach. In this regard, he felt that the number of Trade Policy training courses, particularly those in French, were insufficient. External evaluation of training programmes would be difficult; evaluation would be better conducted by the Secretariat, the trainees and the recipients. To assist recipients and beneficiary countries undertake the evaluation, questionnaires from the Secretariat would be helpful. Furthermore, contacts between the WTO and former trainees should be maintained. To this end, the website for former trainees was useful in the maintenance of these contacts. Electronic training activities were to be stressed and supported.","WTCOMTDm22.pdf","Secretariat, WTO, Secretariat, Member, Secretariat, Secretariat, WTO"
"1573",1573,"51","51.     The representative of Senegal expressed satisfaction with the constant evolution in the quantity and quality of WTO's technical cooperation activities. The prospect of cooperation between the WTO and other international organizations should be welcomed. Complementarity should be promoted to the benefit of recipient countries. His delegation welcomed the Secretariat document, which was intended to manage the present while preparing for the future. The evaluation of technical cooperation and training was not a simple matter. Consequently, his delegation supported those who had proposed the holding of informal consultations to address the issue of evaluation.","WTCOMTDm22.pdf","Senegal, WTO, WTO, Secretariat"
"1572",1572,"50","50.      Fourth, referring to the last sentence of paragraph 12, in document WT/COMTD/W/48, on the subject of ""financial considerations"", he disagreed with the sentence which read as follows: ""In the absence of additional Trust Funds, current conditions would force the WTO to scale down technical cooperation activities by about 3 million Swiss francs or by some 20 regional seminars or 150 national missions based on the average cost for 1998"". If this occurred, it would mean the scaling-down of the opportunity for the integration of developing countries in the multilateral trading system. This was the reason he had underscored the point that technical assistance was not an adjunct or supplementary to the implementation of WTO Agreements. In the same paragraph, he had noted the distribution of contributions by Members to Trust Funds. However, he had not seen the quantum of funds available in the regular budget for technical cooperation activities, but felt that it would be less than the 3 million Swiss francs projected as shortfall. Consequently, in the evaluation of technical cooperation and in the review of future activities, the WTO should be prepared to use the regular budget and to ensure that a proportionate amount of resources are available to meet the objectives of integration. He also said that an idea suggested by his delegation, following its Trade Policy Review the previous week, was that the range of trade policy reviews of developing countries could be considered and assessed over time with a view to usefully identifying and indicating the lacunae in their notifications and in the implementation of their obligations. As a result, technical cooperation should not be general but focus on the specifics. It was a systemic part of implementation; and should, therefore, fit all the WTO Agreements together to ensure that small economies and developing countries were integrated.","WTCOMTDm22.pdf","WTO, WTO, Members, WTO, WTO"
"1571",1571,"5","5.      The Chairman recalled that the delegation of Egypt had submitted a Working Paper on ""Electronic Commerce in Goods and Services"" circulated as WT/COMTD/W/38 in March 1998. The Working Paper included several proposals, inter alia, the proposal that the Secretariat should be requested to prepare an analytical paper on enhancing the participation of developing countries in electronic commerce and the use of information technology in the integration of developing countries in the multilateral trading system. He further recalled that at the informal consultations on 16 September 1998, the Secretariat informed the Committee that it was preparing a document on the WT/COMTD/M/22 Page 2 development dimension of electronic commerce. Furthermore, on 25 September, the General Council adopted a comprehensive Work Programme on Electronic Commerce. In the Work Programme, terms of reference were allocated to four WTO bodies. In this regard, the Committee had been asked to examine and report on the development implications of electronic commerce, taking into account the economic, financial and development needs of developing countries. The issues to be examined included:         -       Effects of electronic commerce on the trade and economic prospects of developing                 countries, notably of their small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), and means of                 maximizing possible benefits accruing to them;         -       Challenges to and ways of enhancing the participation of developing countries in                 electronic commerce, in particular as exporters of electronically delivered products:                 role of improved access to infrastructure and transfer of technology, and of movement                 of natural persons;         -       Use of information technology in the integration of developing countries in the                 multilateral trading system;         -       Implications for developing countries of the possible impact of electronic commerce                 on the traditional means of distribution of physical goods;         -       Financial implications of electronic commerce for developing countries.","WTCOMTDm22.pdf","Chairman, Egypt, Electronic, Commerce, in, Goods, Secretariat, Secretariat, Committee, General, Council, Work, Programme, Electronic, Commerce, Work, Programme, WTO, Committee"

The representative of Jamaica commended the Secretariat for the high quality documentation; evidence that the concerns and interests of developing countries for integration and full participation in the multilateral trading system were being advanced. He emphasised several key issues. First, in evaluation it was important to strengthen and enhance human and institutional capacities in the public and private sector. Second, the key test of the effectiveness of technical assistance was how well it assisted Jamaica to fulfill its obligations and to enforce its rights, if the rights needed enforcement. Third, technical assistance was not an adjunct to the implementation of the Agreements, but a systemic matter. Technical assistance was not a set of discrete and separate activities, but a systemic and integral part of the fulfilment and implementation of WTO Agreements. Jamaica judged technical assistance as effective, if it enabled it to secure the balance of its benefits from its participation in the multilateral trading system. He believed that this position was held, not only by Jamaica, but also by other trading partners, to the extent that it made the trading regimes of these countries more transparent and open, and allowed the expansion of trading opportunities in domestic economies and in the economies of the trading partners. Technical assistance was therefore not simply a project or a supplement to implementation. Technical cooperation was also not a charitable contribution by some Members to others.","WTCOMTDm22.pdf","Jamaica, Secretariat, Jamaica, WTO, Jamaica, Jamaica, Members"

The representative of El Salvador stated that trade policy courses, referred to in the document, were of immense value and importance for the training of her country's trade policy officials.

It was not possible to address evaluation, including the substantive aspects, until procedures exist. These procedures would guide the WTO in the evaluation of technical cooperation and assistance activities. Constant internal evaluation was necessary. Such internal evaluation should be structured and institutionalized in the form of an internal evaluation unit. Nonetheless, external evaluation must also take place. To ensure complementarity between external and internal evaluation and the independence of the evaluation exercise which should aim at transparency and impartiality and, as a consequence, assess the impact of WTO technical assistance activities. A methodological framework needed to be established to serve as a basis for subsequent evaluation. This framework could include several elements to cover implementation and impact. Within this framework several criteria would be useful. These criteria would relate to the general objectives of the WTO and the more specific aims of particular technical assistance programmes. His delegation stated that the scope of evaluation should not only include the assessment of the impact of technical assistance, but should also consider the implementation of technical assistance programmes. This form of assessment should be part of both assessment and implementation of technical cooperation programmes. In this way, corrections can be made to technical assistance and cooperation programmes, if necessary, as those programmes were underway. There should also be mid-term evaluation of programmes which would make it possible to improve on implementation of programmes.","WTCOMTDm22.pdf","Morocco, WTO, WTO, WTO"

Due to budgetary constraints, cost effectiveness and the quality of technical assistance were very important. In this regard, evaluation was a necessary exercise. Considering the three dimensions of evaluation namely, internal Secretariat evaluation, external evaluation and beneficiary evaluation, his delegation believed that these three methodologies were complementary and could be used simultaneously to maximise the advantage of each system. His delegation shared the view of the European Communities that the evaluation methodology used by other international organizations could be useful, even though WTO technical assistance was specific in nature. He supported the Norwegian and Swiss proposals for informal consultations.","WTCOMTDm22.pdf","Japan, Secretariat, Secretariat, WTO"
"1565",1565,"44","44.     Norway agreed with the view expressed in the Secretariat paper that it would be a challenge to establish a system of evaluation because the results of the activities would often be difficult to measure. Nonetheless, donors still expected some form of evaluation in order to establish a causal link between technical assistance and results or lack of results. Therefore, an effort at evaluation WT/COMTD/M/22 Page 10 should be made; in its absence, it would be difficult to defend the expenses. His delegation agreed with the Secretariat observation that requests for technical assistance were often very general. To this end, his delegation joined with the Secretariat in encouraging Members to be more specific in their formulation of requests for technical assistance, such as the specific objectives they would like to achieve through the technical assistance. Finally, in establishing a system of evaluation for the system, account must be taken of the need to evaluate joint activities with other agencies and to avoid evaluation of overlapping programmes. His delegation supported the position of Switzerland to hold informal consultations on the issue of evaluation.","WTCOMTDm22.pdf","Norway, Secretariat, Secretariat, Secretariat, Members, Switzerland"
"1564",1564,"43","43.      The representative of Norway welcomed the useful Secretariat paper. His delegation considered that there were core principles that should constitute guiding principles for evaluation. First, was the establishment of relevant criteria for evaluation, which could be quantitative or qualitative. These should include cost efficiency and the impact of technical assistance on the beneficiaries. Such criteria should be simple, practical, objective and transparent. Second, evaluation should be continuous and an integral part of WTO technical assistance activities. Third, external evaluation should be conducted regularly with a view to assessing whether technical assistance had the anticipated impact on the beneficiaries. Fourth, as a rule, the costs of technical assistance should be covered by core funding. Fifth, the use of questionnaires for participants in trade policy courses and seminars was a useful instrument and could be further developed. His delegation supported the idea of regularly circulating questionnaires to beneficiary countries. This procedure would offer a beneficiary an opportunity to provide details of assistance received and how such assistance, including skills acquired, had been used.","WTCOMTDm22.pdf","Norway, Secretariat, WTO"
"1563",1563,"42","42.      The representative of the United States underscored the importance of introducing procedures and criteria for evaluating the effectiveness of technical cooperation and assistance. She recalled the position by Egypt stressing the utility of targeting specific and demand-driven approaches rather than raising issues in the abstract. She emphasised the importance of taking advantage of available technical assistance, whatever the means for delivery. The United States had mentioned initiatives for enhanced technical assistance, for example, through out-sourcing as in the WIPO/WTO initiative. In the light of the interest by delegations, her delegation wondered how Members would avail themselves of the technical assistance opportunities present in that joint initiative. Follow-up to programmes, raised in the Secretariat report, was another important issue. To this end, it was necessary that beneficiary governments should provide on-going substantive support for those undergoing training, and to ensure that information acquired was used to achieve the goals of the training activity.","WTCOMTDm22.pdf","United, States, Egypt, United, States, Members, Secretariat"
"1562",1562,"41","41.      The representative of the European Communities (EC) noted that the Secretariat paper raised the right questions. Technical assistance activities were difficult to qualify and measure. Two reasons were central in the evaluation of any activity: one was to measure the degree of success in achieving the objectives, and the other was to learn lessons and to increase the effectiveness of future activities. In this regard, it was necessary to establish criteria for success. Preferably, it was best to establish these criteria in the planning stage, and also to involve the recipients in the establishment of criteria. The EC believed that several questions were relevant such as: (a) at what levels of activity should evaluation be undertaken bearing in mind different levels, for example, sectors, seminars, countries and regions; (b) what criteria should be used; and, (c) how will be the lessons of the past and the present be integrated into future policies and practices? In the view of her delegation, the basic objective and criteria of WTO technical assistance was to increase the knowledge of WTO rules and regulations, and to enhance the ability of developing countries to take advantage of the system. These were the basic objectives and criteria against which WTO technical cooperation and assistance had to be evaluated.","WTCOMTDm22.pdf","EC, Secretariat, EC, WTO, WTO, WTO"
"1561",1561,"40","40.      The representative of Switzerland welcomed the Secretariat paper, which offered many issues for reflection. He requested the Secretariat to undertake with the Committee an internal evaluation of WTO technical cooperation activities, based on document Job No.4299, which could provide the basis for developing a methodology for internal evaluation. In this connection, an informal process could be established comprising interested delegations and the Secretariat for implementing internal evaluation.","WTCOMTDm22.pdf","Switzerland, Secretariat, Secretariat, Committee, WTO, Secretariat"

"1559",1559,"39","39.     The Chairman recalled that at the last meeting of the Committee, the Secretariat had been requested to prepare a document for further reflection on the evaluation of technical assistance. The document had now been circulated with reference Job No. 4299. The document referred to the Guidelines for Technical Cooperation and Training and the Implementation Modalities; examined the manner of assessing technical cooperation and training, made a distinction between internal and external evaluation; and addressed the issue of evaluation criteria. The document contained an annex with a questionnaire used by participants for assessing technical cooperation activity, and for discussing training activities conducted in the WTO Trade Policy Courses.

The representative of Japan briefed the Committee on a seminar in Singapore entitled: WTO Regional Seminar on Dispute Settlement Procedures and Practices for Asia and Pacific Countries, which had taken place from 29 to 30 October 1998. The seminar had been made possible with financial contributions by the Government of Japan. The purpose of the Seminar was three-fold namely: first, to disseminate comprehensive information on the dispute settlement mechanism in the past three and half-years; second, to hear the assessments of academics on the performance of the mechanism and suggestions for improvement; and third, to undertake an informal exchange of views amongst the participants, which included representatives of 11 Member Governments, academics from four Member Governments, and WTO Secretariat officials.","WTCOMTDm22.pdf","Japan, Committee, Singapore, WTO, Asia, Pacific, Countries, Japan, Member, Member, WTO, Secretariat"

"1556",1556,"36","36.      The representative of Egypt saw no a contradiction between the statement by the representative of Switzerland and the preliminary descriptions by the Secretariat. The use of information technology for the delivery of technical cooperation and assistance was a new area. As a result, more information was required for a proper understanding of its use. In addition, this was a cross-cutting issue because different kinds of technical assistance could be delivered through the means of information technology. It was not simply a question of a specific area where information was required on a sectoral basis. The whole purpose was to better understand the use of information technology as a means for delivering technical cooperation and assistance. This was an important question for the development, dissemination and improvement of the quality of technical assistance.","WTCOMTDm22.pdf","Egypt, Switzerland, Secretariat"
"1555",1555,"35","35.      The representative of Switzerland agreed that the use of information technology was important for technical cooperation. However, he wondered if separate papers should be requested for on each area of technical cooperation. Regular separate reporting on technical cooperation activities should cover every area, including the use of information technology means. His delegation was not certain as to the need for the paper requested by Egypt. His delegation had understood the question by Egypt and the consequent request to the Secretariat to ask the Secretariat to describe the possible ways for using information technology to deliver technical cooperation and assistance, and hence improve the cost efficiency and operation of technical cooperation and assistance. If this was the understanding, Switzerland would not oppose the request by Egypt.","WTCOMTDm22.pdf","Switzerland, Egypt, Egypt, Secretariat, Secretariat, Switzerland, Egypt"
"1554",1554,"34","34.      Mr. Léger clarified the second issue raised by the representative of Switzerland. He recalled that since last year, there had been several WTO Secretariat initiatives on information technology. These included making available to Members through the Document Dissemination Facility (DDF), the previous day's documents in all official languages together with a search capability; and installation in LDC Members, WTO Reference Centres with connection to the Internet, access to the WTO website, and access to the Information Development website which is a joint undertaking with WT/COMTD/M/22 Page 8 the World Bank.       This year, the WTO Secretariat had used, at least on two occasions, video-conferencing means for training purposes, and it intended to place more emphasis on this vehicle in the near future. Technical cooperation training courses would be available on the WTO internet website, by 15 November 1998. Videos are being developed on WTO Agreements, for example, one is currently being developed on the Agreement on Textiles and Clothing. These videos would explain the agreements with their rights and obligations.","WTCOMTDm22.pdf","Léger, Switzerland, WTO, Secretariat, Members, Members, WTO, WTO, Information, Development, World, Bank, WTO, Secretariat, WTO, WTO"
"1553",1553,"33","33.      In response, Mr. Hoda, Deputy Director-General, recalled that technical cooperation activities are Member-driven. To the extent that Members could state early in the year what activities they foresee, and to the extent that information existed on the activities of other organizations, improvements could be made. However, current experience showed that Members' requests do not arrive at the beginning of the year but as time goes on. The situation was very similar with international organizations. Some could give early notice of the activities that they would like the Secretariat to participate in, while others could not. The Secretariat could correctly anticipate the numbers if it the entire planning was within its complete control. Inputs from other Members requesting technical assistance and from other international organizations desirous of collaboration with the WTO could not be fully anticipated.","WTCOMTDm22.pdf","Hoda, Director-General, Members, Members, Secretariat, Secretariat, Members, WTO"
"1552",1552,"32","32.      The representative of Switzerland requested clarification on two issues: first, on the definition of the background note request by Egypt; and, second, on the reasons for the divergence in the Secretariat's Plan figures for technical cooperation activities envisaged at the beginning of 1998 and the final actual figures for the same year. On the latter, he noted that although discrepancies could arise, the doubling of figures between Plan figures and actual figures was significant, and the Secretariat should try to improve on the system to ensure more predictability.","WTCOMTDm22.pdf","Switzerland, Egypt, Secretariat, Secretariat"
"1551",1551,"31","31.     Responding to the observation by Switzerland that comparison of the planned activities for 1998 relative to those that actually took place showed an approximate doubling of the numbers, Mr. Legér said that based on the Secretariat's short experience since 1995, this was not unusual. Most missions that took place could not be foreseen at the time when the Secretariat requested developing countries to provide indications of technical assistance needs for the following year. In addition, many actors were involved in each mission such as the Secretariat, the hosting country, account had to be taken of funding resources as well as coverage, participation and documentation; and all of these had an impact on the exact dates and coverage of these actual missions.","WTCOMTDm22.pdf","Switzerland, Legér, Secretariat, Secretariat, Secretariat"
"1550",1550,"30","30.      In response to the representative of the Philippines, the Director confirmed that the Division was still responsible for training; and explained that the change in the name of the Division took place was based on the fact that training could be delivered in different ways such as through video-conferencing, cassettes, and other means that were not available in the past. Furthermore, training could suggest to some delegations that only a one-way communication was envisaged. This was not the case. Training was a two-way communication, and the Division had as much to learn from delegations with regard to culture and approaches to training, as delegations had to learn from the experts either from the WTO or from experts in other international organizations assisting the WTO in the training courses. For these reasons, it was felt proper to assume the title of Technical Cooperation Division.","WTCOMTDm22.pdf","Philippines, Director, WTO, WTO"

The representative of Egypt sought confirmation of his delegation's understanding that the Secretariat, while awaiting responses, would commence work based on information currently available in the Secretariat, such as from trade policy review reports, reports from technical missions by the Technical Cooperation Division, statements made by delegations, and other sources.","WTCOMTDm22.pdf","Egypt, Secretariat, Secretariat, Technical, Cooperation, Division"
"1548",1548,"29","29.     In response to the request from the Egyptian delegation, he noted that the Secretariat would prepare a background note on information technology. This was a new field, holding a lot of promise for technical cooperation and training. As suggested by Egypt, the Secretariat would revise paragraph 18 of its paper, taking into consideration the issue of full integration, and the strengthening of human and institutional capacity.","WTCOMTDm22.pdf","Secretariat, Egypt, Secretariat"
"1547",1547,"28","28.     Regarding the method of reporting technical cooperation activities, the Secretariat was willing to consult with interested delegations to determine how best to improve on reporting of activities, for                                                                                     WT/COMTD/M/22                                                                                             Page 7 example, either with regard to number of staff hours, or in the number of days, or whether such activities were at the national or regional level.","WTCOMTDm22.pdf","Secretariat"
"1546",1546,"27","27.     On the specific matter of financing, Mr. Léger stated that the Secretariat currently expected a considerable shortfall in resources for 1999. He indicated that in 1998, the Secretariat would have spent approximately Sfr5 million in connection with Technical Cooperation activities of which the regular budget is Sfr741,000 only. Currently, a shortfall existed of Sfr3 million, representing, according to average cost calculations for 1998, 20 regional seminars or 150 technical cooperation missions.","WTCOMTDm22.pdf","Léger, Secretariat, Secretariat"
"1545",1545,"26","26.     Mr. Léger began by saying that technical cooperation was not the exclusive responsibility of the Technical Cooperation Division, but was the responsibility of all Divisions in the Secretariat. More than 50 per cent of technical cooperation activities in 1998 were undertaken by other divisions in the Secretariat. Second, human resources in these divisions might, in future, be diverted to other processes and issues, such as those leading to the 3rd Ministerial Conference, to the mandated negotiations, and to the increased recourse by developing countries to dispute settlement procedures.","WTCOMTDm22.pdf","Léger, Technical, Cooperation, Division, Secretariat, Secretariat"

"1543",1543,"24","24.      The representative of Australia commended the Secretariat for an interesting and thorough paper that provided the basis for transparency in the area of technical cooperation. She expressed satisfaction for the attention given to issues of increased productivity and out-sourcing especially in regional areas where there would be greater expertise and familiarity with problems to be addressed. Australia was also satisfied with the follow-up to the High-Level Meeting. Her delegation was encouraged by the cooperation between the Secretariat and other international organizations, particularly in areas where there was complementarity, such as WIPO. The Secretariat Paper showed that there was growing demand for technical cooperation in areas that were comparatively new for the WTO. The WTO would be under pressure to respond, and there was much to be learnt in the future. Financing issues needed to be explored. Greater focus would be required on the value-added aspects in the best roles of the WTO such as noted by Egypt with regard to implementation and the mandated future negotiations. While noting and agreeing to the links between broader development aims, infrastructure, human resource development, and an ability to implement WTO commitments, her delegation emphasised the importance of the need for a careful examination of the Secretariat's expertise, capacities, and how best to work with other organizations to fulfill the needs of this Organization. The WTO had an important role to play in trade and development for developing countries, but it was only one aspect, and there were many other organizations that could contribute. Finally, her delegation welcomed the transparency which brought out the important linkages in the area of technical cooperation.","WTCOMTDm22.pdf","Australia, Secretariat, Australia, Secretariat, WIPO, Secretariat, WTO, WTO, WTO, Egypt, WTO, Secretariat, WTO"
"1542",1542,"23","23.      The representative of Canada commended the Secretariat for an excellent paper. Her delegation emphasised the importance and the desirability of the regional approach, the link-up with regional institutions and funding institutions. The regional approach was particularly important in the light of upcoming negotiations. Her delegation supported the Secretariat approach to reach-out to other organizations and the emphasis placed on the training of trainers. She considered that a main issue in technical assistance arena was the lack of coherence at the regional level. Coherence could be improved both improved both horizontally with better coordination amongst donors, and vertically by ensuring a proper sequence in the delivery process. The Three-Year Plan and the follow-up to the HLM and the Integrated Framework were steps in the right direction. Her delegation shared expressed concerns on ensuring appropriate funding for technical cooperation and assistance.","WTCOMTDm22.pdf","Canada, Secretariat, Secretariat, Integrated, Framework"
"1541",1541,"22","22.      Responding to the views expressed by Egypt on dispute settlement, the representative of Switzerland stated that this was a core activity of the Secretariat, and should not be reduced. By contrast, technical cooperation was not a core WTO activity, and was not an area of comparative advantage for the WTO relative to other organizations. Accordingly, out-sourcing should be pursued, and more thinking was required on activities which should be out-sourced. Before a final position was taken, detailed evaluation was required to determine, for instance, which activities should be out- sourced and which retained for execution by the Secretariat. Regarding measures for the evaluation of technical cooperation and training activities, his delegation agreed with the representative of Egypt that the number of activities was not a good measure. However, in the absence of any other measure, Members had to work on this quantitative basis with its limitations. For instance while 141 activities had been planned for 1998, according to the Secretariat document, the actual number of activities was 277, almost double the number planned. This highlighted several problems, including those of predictability for planning purposes and the divergence between plans and reality. Closer examination showed that the variance in the figures was accounted for by external invitations to the Secretariat, together with the follow-up to the HLM for LDCs, which was expressed separately as an WT/COMTD/M/22 Page 6 additional category. His delegation was firmly of the view that a detailed analysis of technical cooperation and training activities was only possible after a detailed evaluation.","WTCOMTDm22.pdf","Egypt, Switzerland, Secretariat, WTO, WTO, Secretariat, Egypt, Members, Secretariat, Secretariat"
"1540",1540,"21","21.      The representative of Switzerland welcomed the Secretariat paper. His delegation attached importance to several issues under this agenda item. These included the discussion of the Secretariat Three-Year Plan for technical cooperation and training activities, transparency in funding and execution of such activities, critical evaluation of technical cooperation activities, and lessons to be learned from such activities. He posed several questions on the Three-Year Plan; for instance, his delegation felt that more detailed description of projects would assist in better judgement of the projects. The financing of technical cooperation and training activities presented a problem to be solved. The large number of Trust Funds and their operation were non-transparent, confusing, impractical for both donors and the Secretariat, and placed a management burden on the Secretariat. Switzerland believed there should be multilateral trade-related technical cooperation, managed in detail and evaluated by the Secretariat, which would limit the detailed involvement and evaluation of donors. In this regard, more had to be done.","WTCOMTDm22.pdf","Switzerland, Secretariat, Secretariat, Secretariat, Secretariat, Switzerland, Secretariat"

She noted the increase in the request for technical cooperation and assistance activities by developing countries. This thrust should be encouraged. ASEAN attached importance to the trade policy courses, and to this end commended the Secretariat for arranging, at least, two trade policy courses annually in English. These courses were widely sought after. Finally, her delegation sought clarification, following the re-structuring of the Secretariat, on the nomenclature of the Technical Cooperation Division, which now no longer had the ""Training"" component in the title. Her delegation sought assurance that training courses would continue undiminished.","WTCOMTDm22.pdf","Philippines, ASEAN, Secretariat, ASEAN, Secretariat, Secretariat, Technical, Cooperation, Division"

The Chairman recalled that since the last meeting, the Moroccan delegation had submitted a paper entitled: ""Review of the Application of Special Provisions in the Multilateral Trade Agreements and Related Ministerial Decisions in Favour of Developing Country Members (WT/COMTD/W/46). Following open-ended informal consultations, consensus had emerged that the Secretariat should prepare a letter to Members containing a questionnaire regarding any difficulties being experienced by Members in the implementation of special and differential provisions in the WTO Agreements. The Chairman emphasized that the Secretariat would compile and analyze any replies, but make no judgements. This letter and questionnaire had now been circulated to Members.","WTCOMTDm22.pdf","Chairman, Members, Secretariat, Members, Members, WTO, Chairman, Secretariat, Members"
"1537",1537,"19","19.      Finally, on the activities per se, his delegation, in addition to the position stated by the United States, felt that it was important that technical assistance and cooperation should aim at assisting developing countries after the transitional period and assist developing countries in the preparation of future negotiations.","WTCOMTDm22.pdf","United, States"
"1536",1536,"18","18.      Fourth, his delegation supported the idea of out-sourcing of technical assistance, such as the sub-contracting of technical assistance, mentioned in paragraph 8 of the document, because of the limited resources available to the Secretariat. However, this idea might need examination by the Committee on Budget, Finance and Administration. His delegation hoped that this could be done in order to allow out-sourcing to experts outside the Organization. Fifth, while cooperation between the WTO and other organizations was important, Egypt was concerned with the imbalance between the need for observance of obligations within the WTO and the relegation of technical assistance to other organizations. This had been observed, by his delegation, with regard to the joint initiatives with WIPO on the TRIPS Agreement and with the ITU and telecommunications. This issue required further examination. The problem was that the objective of the WTO was to have different Members implement their commitments, whereas the objective of some other international organizations included such things as issues relating to long-term human resource development, and not necessarily the implementation of commitments in the WTO. Sixth, Egypt welcomed the trend towards regional cooperation. However, it had to be borne in mind that in some cases, national requirements were specific and different from regional needs, therefore, a balance needed to be struck. Next, his delegation shared the concern expressed on funding, and supported the position emphasized by Tanzania on the need for predictability in funding. Additional information and greater transparency                                                                                      WT/COMTD/M/22                                                                                              Page 5 were required on conditions attached by donors on their contributions to the Trust Funds as well as their stated priorities for technical assistance. Delegations had a right to know of conditions attached by donors to contributions and to their technical assistance offers. Lastly, the representative of Egypt noted that in paragraph 18, the Secretariat stated that the global objectives of its technical cooperation objectives, as summarized in a previous document, continued to be valid. However, his delegation was concerned that some of the objectives incorporated in the WTO guidelines had not been explicitly included in the overall objectives, including the full integration of beneficiaries into the multilateral trading system and strengthening human capacity-building in developing countries.","WTCOMTDm22.pdf","Secretariat, Committee, on, Budget, ,, Finance, and, Administration, WTO, Egypt, WTO, WIPO, ITU, WTO, Members, WTO, Egypt, Tanzania, Egypt, Secretariat, WTO"
"1535",1535,"17","17.      The representative of Egypt, while welcoming the Secretariat document, raised several issues and concerns. First, the way in which activities were counted was sometimes misleading. For instance, an activity involving a large amount of resources and many man hours by a large Secretariat delegation could not be compared to another activity over a day or two and involving only one Secretariat official. He hoped that more accurate measures would be devised for monitoring and evaluating technical cooperation and assistance activities, rather than using the number of activities which were not always indicative of size, scope and the nature of the activities. Second, as was evident in paragraph 6 of the document, his delegation was concerned with the fact that much of the Secretariat's activities was tied up with dispute settlement; when assistance was requested, his delegation and several others were often confronted by the fact that Secretariat officials were occupied with dispute settlement procedures that require their full attention. This problem required further attention. Third, his delegation attached importance to the use of information technology in the delivery of technical assistance, mentioned in paragraph 7 of the report. Egypt felt that the use of information technology could assist developing countries in addressing some of the difficulties associated with the implementation of WTO Agreements. His delegation requested the Secretariat to prepare a background note on activities taking place in relation to the use of information technology for the delivery of technical assistance, the Secretariat's thinking on the nature, and the scope for development of information technology in this regard.","WTCOMTDm22.pdf","Egypt, Secretariat, Secretariat, Secretariat, Secretariat, Secretariat, Egypt, WTO, Secretariat, Secretariat"

"1533",1533,"16","16.      The representative of Bangladesh commended the Secretariat for its valuable document. As an LDC, his delegation attached importance to technical cooperation and training activities and was benefitting immensely from such activities. His delegation appreciated the current focus on the regional spread of the activities, and would like to see it expanded. Like Tanzania and Norway, Bangladesh was also concerned with the funding of technical cooperation and training activities. While expressing gratitude to the generous contributions from donors, his delegation was concerned that funding was uncertain, irregular and ad hoc. His delegation would recommend that funding for technical cooperation activities should become part of the regular budget; the General Council should work to this end. His delegation also wondered how technical cooperation and assistance programmes could be critically evaluated, as if they were being financed from the regular budget, whereas the funding was from individual donors. His delegation would welcome the views of other Members on this observation. If the activities surrounding the LDC programme were not funded from the regular budget, it would be difficult to imagine a predictable programme for LDCs. His delegation supported the proposal by the representative of Norway to accord priority to LDCs in the event of budgetary short-falls, he was confident that developing country delegations would not object to the Norwegian proposal.","WTCOMTDm22.pdf","Bangladesh, Secretariat, Tanzania, Norway, Bangladesh, General, Council, Members, Norway"
"1532",1532,"159","159.  The Secretariat thanked delegations for their proposals and said that it would be useful to have more informal consultations on the contents of the paper requested by delegations from the                                                                                  WT/COMTD/M/22                                                                                         Page 31 Secretariat on trade facilitation. There had been a major symposium in March 1998 on the subject with major contributions from governments and the private sector, but more clarification was needed to provide the Secretariat with more focus. Furthermore, contributions from delegations on this issue would be very welcome even on an informal basis.

The representative of the United States expressed appreciation for the Secretariat document which highlighted issues of importance that the Committee will face in the coming years, particularly questions relating to implementation of the various agreements, and awareness and consciousness-raising requirements in order for Members to fully understand their rights and obligation in the WTO. She expressed appreciation of the joint initiative by the WTO and the WIPO on the TRIPS Agreement to provide enhanced technical assistance for countries requesting assistance on implementation. The need for countries to meet their obligation by the year 2000 would place more emphasis on technical cooperation and assistance in 1999.

There had been a rapid increase in technical cooperation and training activities since 1995. His delegation was encouraged by the improvements in these activities as shown by the use of new technologies and the organization of regional seminars, which were cost efficient and effective and should be increased. His delegation had noted from the Secretariat document, the possibility of a funding shortfall for future demand technical cooperation and training activities. This situation could force difficult choices and prioritization. He underscored the principle that technical cooperation and assistance should be demand-driven, but if available funds are limited, LDCs should be given priority. Furthermore, constraints on funding for technical cooperation should lead to increased cooperation amongst WTO, ITC and UNCTAD and increased out-sourcing of parts of WTO's technical cooperation and assistance activities to ITC, UNCTAD, and possibly also to other organizations. On the concerns expressed by the representative of Tanzania on the financing of technical cooperation, his delegation's position was that the only viable solution was to increase the core fund.","WTCOMTDm22.pdf","Norway, Secretariat, Secretariat, LDCs, WTO, ITC, UNCTAD, WTO, ITC, UNCTAD, Tanzania"

In this regard, he invited Committee Members to participate in the Partners for Development Meeting in Lyon from 9 to 12 November 1998. At this meeting, electronic commerce would be one of the subjects to be discussed, as would be other subjects such as transport, trade facilitation, trade points, micro-financing, bio-trade, etc. Several pre-occupations raised at this meeting would be discussed at the Lyon meeting which would engage the private sector and civil society.","WTCOMTDm22.pdf","Committee, Members, Partners, for, Development, Meeting, Lyon, Lyon"
"1506",1506,"135","135.    The representative of UNCTAD responded to the comments made and questions raised. First, the trade points were based on the rationale of assisting traders within a country to enter into negotiations with other traders to buy and to sell goods and services. It was geared to address the problems faced by small and medium-sized exporters and importers. It was intended to be a private sector oriented system. However, UNCTAD had noticed that some trade points were based in ministries. This was not an efficient use of the system. In countries where the trade points had been located within chambers of commerce they had usually turned out to be more effective. However, there was not a single recipe for the success of trade points. In some places, the trade points had been more successful than others.","WTCOMTDm22.pdf","UNCTAD, UNCTAD"

She said that the representative of Mexico had usefully highlighted the importance of small and medium enterprises as the principal entities in developing countries. Against this background, her delegation was therefore of the view that the Committee should discuss the role of trade facilitation in furthering the trade prospects of developing countries particularly in the conduct of trade through electronic means. She also referred to the statement by the representative of the European Communities which had highlighted the indispensable nature of trade facilitation for development activities. All these dimensions, in the view of her delegation, should be discussed in the Committee within the framework of the Work Programme on Trade Facilitation of the CTG. The representative of India, in addition, requested for clarity on the nature of the reservations by some countries on various elements of the Kyoto Convention. Such a discussion in the Committee would make it possible to understand the diversity of administrative and facilitation practices across the world and in particular the problems that were endemic to developing countries.","WTCOMTDm22.pdf","India, UNCTAD, Mexico, Committee, Committee, Work, Programme, CTG, India, Committee"

In a number of countries in Central and South America, there were several projects in this regard. His delegation requested UNCTAD's impressions/assessments as to how these Trade Points had contributed to trade facilitation, for instance in Central and South America? Furthermore, what type of follow-up had been accorded to these projects?","WTCOMTDm22.pdf","Panama, UNCTAD, South, America, UNCTAD, South, America"
"1503",1503,"132","132.   He remarked that the work of the UNECE focused on Electronic Data Interchange which was a backbone of most electronic commerce and trade facilitation. This should be further considered at the Committee. To this end, he suggested that a complementary view would be helpful from the Centre for the Facilitation of Procedures and Practices in Administration and Commerce and WT/COMTD/M/22 Page 28 Transport (CEFACT). Such a view would offer ideas as to the major issues in the linkage between the multilateral trading system and the electronic trading system. He said that over 40 years of GATT/WTO work had been focused on market access and market presence issues, however, the UNECE envisioned a new area of market communication issues. He, therefore, proposed that the Committee should invite at its next meeting the representative of CEFACT to address the Committee on the major issues before it and the UNECE regarding the linkages between trade facilitation and electronic commerce within the multilateral trading system.","WTCOMTDm22.pdf","Electronic, Data, Interchange, Committee, Facilitation, of, Procedures, and, Practices, in, Administration, and, Commerce, GATT/WTO, UNECE, Committee, Committee"
"1502",1502,"131","131.      The representative of the UNECE said that the organization had undertaken important work in this area in the past 30 years. Bearing in mind the discussions underway, he noted that some delegations had highlighted the interoperability issues between electronic commerce and trade facilitation. Indeed, the subject of trade facilitation was amenable to analysis from different perspectives. In his view, if the 21st Century global trading system would be composed of two major components namely, (i) the multilateral trading system, based on MFN treatment, and (ii) an electronic trading system, based on most favoured network treatment, it would then be easy to identify a linkage between trade facilitation and electronic commerce.","WTCOMTDm22.pdf","UNECE, MFN"

The representative of the European Communities on the basis of the Report of the March 1998 WTO Symposium on Trade Facilitation, and having regard to the presentations referred to by his delegation, including the presentation by the European Communities, invited the Secretariat to prepare a summary of the elements of interest to Committee Members namely on trade facilitation as a driving force in development policy. This would be a useful approach. His delegation was uncertain as to whether this would duplicate the request by the representative of Egypt, but was certain that this was a proposal that had the merit for further examination.","WTCOMTDm22.pdf","WTO, European, Communities, Secretariat, Committee, Members, Egypt"

The representative of the United Kingdom responded to the questions by the representative of Tanzania on the announced contribution of US$10 million for trade-related technical cooperation over the period April 1998 to March 2000. The money was to be spent not only at the WTO, but also at UNCTAD, at the International Trade Centre (ITC), and conceivably also on bilateral projects. Some projects had already been set up at the ITC and UNCTAD, but not yet at the WTO, although his delegation was in the process of finalizing an offer to the WTO; a pledge would be made to the WTO, possibly before the end of the year.","WTCOMTDm22.pdf","United, Kingdom, Tanzania, WTO, UNCTAD, International, Trade, Centre, ITC, ITC, UNCTAD, WTO, WTO, WTO"
"1499",1499,"129","129.      The representative of the European Communities expressed its conviction that the continued and vigorous promotion of trade facilitation, in all its aspect, was an indispensable element for any development policy. Indeed, trade facilitation and the establishment of rational procedures would lead to the reduction of excessive costs, rational allocation of resources and encouragement of trade and investment. These were tangible advantages for countries that followed the path of trade facilitation. Several speakers had expressed these advantages. These speakers included the Chambers of Commerce of Peru, Zimbabwe and the Customs Department of Chile. The latter had shown that through the re-organization of its services and techniques, it had obtained spectacular results in cost reduction and in the efficiency of its services. On this basis and on the basis of experience in this area, his delegation concluded that trade facilitation was a win-win situation. Furthermore, his delegation stressed that this win-win aspect should be reflected in the possible contributions by the Committee to the Work Programme of the CTG in advance of the latter's March 1999 meeting.","WTCOMTDm22.pdf","European, Communities, Chambers, of, Commerce, of, Peru, Zimbabwe, Customs, Department, Chile, Committee, Work, Programme, CTG"
"1498",1498,"128","128.    The representative of Egypt agreed that the presentation by UNCTAD was valuable. The area of trade facilitation was complex and multi-dimensional. The difficulty seen by his delegation in the consideration of this subject at the WTO was the fragmentation of the subject into different committees. This created difficulties for the Committee in playing a coherent role on the item although important development aspects existed on the subject of trade facilitation. What, therefore, was required was a Secretariat Note that would assist the Members in structuring their discussions on the subject. His delegation acknowledged that several delegations had presented papers such as the European Communities, Switzerland, Korea, Hong Kong, China, as well as the Secretariat. The problem, however, was one of fragmentation across several WTO bodies. The objective of his delegation was not to duplicate the discussions taking place in other WTO bodies, but for a Secretariat Note to assist Members in rationalizing and structuring their discussions, and hence in contributing to the Work Programme of the CTG.","WTCOMTDm22.pdf","Egypt, UNCTAD, WTO, Committee, Secretariat, Members, Switzerland, Korea, Hong, Kong, China, Secretariat, WTO, WTO, Secretariat, Members, Work, Programme, CTG"

"1496",1496,"126","126.    He then focused on the central issue of the ways in which the Committee could contribute to the Work Programme of the CTG on Trade Facilitation. In this connection, his delegation felt that electronic commerce was important and strongly connected and complementary to trade facilitation. Furthermore, an important aspect was the impact of electronic trade on SMEs in developing countries,                                                                                     WT/COMTD/M/22                                                                                            Page 27 as well as the effects of trade facilitation on the trade and economic prospects of developing countries.

The question, however, was the extent to which governments could become involved in this specific aspect of INCOTERMS. Normally, it was the International Chambers of Commerce (ICC) or the International Trade Center (ITC) which updated INCOTERMS in order to make them consistent with the current situation in international trade.","WTCOMTDm22.pdf","International, Chambers, of, Commerce, ICC, International, Trade, Center, ITC"
"1494",1494,"124","124.      The representative of Mexico considered the presentation by UNCTAD valuable. UNCTAD had worked on this area of trade facilitation since 1994. It had evolved a serious programme on trade facilitation. Nonetheless, acute problems were present in the area of trade facilitation. In the view of his delegation there were two major aspects to trade facilitation namely, the simplification of documentation and procedures involving foreign trade particularly as regards exports. He referred to the UNISTE recommendation No. 16 (government as a business), in the presentation by UNCTAD, and wanted to know whether it was appropriate to refer to the government as a business or rather as a trade facilitator of international business and trade. He also wanted to know whether the recommendations adopted in 1994 remained relevant in the light of rapid changes in the international trading environment.","WTCOMTDm22.pdf","Mexico, UNCTAD, UNCTAD, UNISTE, UNCTAD"

"1492",1492,"122","122.      To conclude his presentation, the representative of UNCTAD argued that due to the diversity amongst countries, it was necessary in each country to begin by identifying the key issues in trade facilitation. In this connection, the NFCs were important as a fora for identifying issues, exchanging views and searching for solutions, as well as for raising awareness on trade facilitation-related issues. On the latter, UNCTAD was regularly organizing workshops and seminars on international trade and transport. These seminars provided an opportunity to exchange views with representatives of the public and private sectors. They also served to draw attention to the value of all interested parties meeting at a common forum such as the NFCs and exchanging views. Sometimes, it was difficult for some governments to understand the rationale for the establishment of an NFC, a forum where the government would sit around the same table with the private sector. In the transport sector, for example, several key issues had arisen at NFCs. These issues were grouped into three. First, legal issues under which sub-sets of other issues arose such as transport, banking and insurance. Second, the issue of commercial practice. Under this issue, other sub-issues arose namely INCOTERMS, the use of documentary credits, the problems of foreign exchange, the non-recognition of EDI in some countries as a tool of international trade, and the issue of professional associations which were not well structured and organized and not recognized as partners in international trade. Third, were the operational issues. These included the problem of how to properly operate different transport modes, terminals, preparation and training of road transport operators. There were also problems in the area of border crossing, problems with documentation, issues arising from the automatization of customs information, and the physical problems at customs, points of entry, and transit issues which block or impede the flow of goods. The latter was especially problematic for land-locked countries.","WTCOMTDm22.pdf","UNCTAD, NFCs, UNCTAD, NFCs, NFC, NFCs"
"1491",1491,"121","121.      The representative of UNCTAD selected the transport sector as an example of how trade facilitation operated and could be promoted. In Chapter II of the UNISTE Recommendations, there were four sets of specific recommendations to: (i) commercial parties; (ii) government departments; (iii) intergovernmental organizations; and, (iv) on the implementation of suggested recommendations.         (i)      Recommendations to commercial parties: It was recommended that commercial                  parties should eliminate non-productive areas; improve managerial skills through                  training and career development; implement Trade Points; implement EDI-based                  modern practices, switch to new commercial practices, for example, INCOTERMS,1                  UCP 500 (documentary credit practices); increase capital base; and use NTTFCs;         (ii)     Recommendations to government departments:             It was recommended that                  government departments should modernize laws and regulations; promote National                  Facilitation Committees (NFCs), implement specific operational issues such as block                  trains, updating of banking and insurance practices; stimulate training; harmonize                  sub-regional regulatory policies; create sub-regional databases such as ACIS; and                  hold sub-regional NTTFC meetings;         (iii)    Recommendations to intergovernmental organizations: Intergovernmental                  organizations should offer advice to governments and commercial parties on such                  issues as measures to facilitate the introduction of multimodal transport – door to                  door transportation – modifications of organizational structures, creation of NFCs,                  and organization of awareness campaigns on the value of trade facilitation;         1           INCOTERMS are a set of internationally standardized contractual terms which were devised by the International Chamber of Commerce to allow seller and buyer in a transaction to share responsibilities as deemed appropriate. There are approximately 13 of these different terms that exist, for example, FOB, CIF, etc. These contractual terms need to be incorporated in each contract by means of reference. WT/COMTD/M/22 Page 26         (iv)    Implementation of suggested recommendations: To implement the recommendations,                 technical assistance had to be provided and monitored, awareness had to be created                 on multimodal transport issues; and cooperation had to be ensured amongst interested                 parties.","WTCOMTDm22.pdf","UNCTAD, National, Facilitation, Committees, NFCs, INCOTERMS, International, Chamber, of, Commerce"
"1490",1490,"120","120.     UNCTAD suggested three areas of possible WTO action. First, the WTO could recommend that its Members apply the UNISTE recommendations in general or in particular recommendations 14 to 16. Second, the WTO could require that its Members apply recommendations 14 to 16. Third, the WTO could establish the application of recommendations 14 to 16 as ""an entry requirement"". If this were so, the WTO Secretariat could take initial action to prepare action by Members. Member countries would then decide which action to take; and in this regard, UNCTAD could offer technical assistance to developing countries.","WTCOMTDm22.pdf","UNCTAD, WTO, WTO, Members, WTO, Members, WTO, WTO, Secretariat, Members, Member, UNCTAD"
"1489",1489,"12","12.      The representative of the European Communities commended the Secretariat for a very good and innovative document on triennial planning for technical cooperation and training activities, particularly in paragraph 8 and other paragraphs. The Secretariat was encouraged to pursue the paths it had suggested such as with regard to the use and ""empowerment"" of local and regional institutions, and the use of new technologies to increase productivity. However, the European Communities hoped that technical assistance would not suffer from increased demands made on the Secretariat to support other activities in the future. Her delegation did not see any conflicts in the activities in the Secretariat that would lead to a reduction of technical cooperation activities.","WTCOMTDm22.pdf","Secretariat, Secretariat, European, Communities, Secretariat, Secretariat"
"1488",1488,"119","119.      UNCTAD had reached several conclusions. First, there was a need for WTO rules on trade facilitation. These rules could be either through the ""introduction of conditionalities"" or through the                                                                                          WT/COMTD/M/22                                                                                                 Page 25 recognition that there were new players in international trade who needed a new commercial environment favourable to trade. Second, cooperation was needed. UNCTAD was ready and willing to cooperate with WTO in the field of technical cooperation for the implementation of any new rule on trade facilitation, particularly in those areas where rules had been recommended by the UNECE, UNCTAD, and in the area of the set of rules recommended by the UNISTE – United Nations International Symposium on Trade Efficiency at Columbus, Ohio, in 1994. He elaborated on some of the recommendations, from the meeting in Columbus which, in the view of UNCTAD, could be the basis for further discussion for rules in trade facilitation.           These were:   (a) UNISTE Recommendation 14, dealing with facilitation at the national level; (b) UNISTE Recommendation 15, addressing administrative procedures and operations in various areas; and (c) UNISTE Recommendation 16, emphasising the desirability for governments acting commercially, meeting user needs, using standard commercial documents, using Electronic Data Interchange (EDI), and employing commercial best practices.","WTCOMTDm22.pdf","UNCTAD, WTO, UNCTAD, WTO, UNCTAD, UNISTE, United, Nations, Columbus, Ohio, Columbus, UNCTAD, Electronic, Data, Interchange"
"1487",1487,"118","118.     The representative of UNCTAD emphasised the importance of trade facilitation in one country. In this regard, the mechanism of a National Trade Facilitation Committee or sometimes referred to as the National Trade Facilitation and Transport Committee (NTTFC) was of indispensable value. Within this mechanism, all the key parties and interests in international trade were brought together. These included the public and private sector, as well as users and providers of services. Some of the specific interests, agencies, government departments and ministries which had tended to participate in this forum in some countries were the ministries of trade, finance, transport, national planning, transport operators, banks, insurance companies, customs, etc. At this forum, these interests examined proposals and searched for consensus between commercial parties and governmental authorities on facilitation measures to improve international trade and transport.","WTCOMTDm22.pdf","UNCTAD, National, Trade, Facilitation, Committee, National, Trade, Facilitation, and, Transport, Committee"
"1486",1486,"117","117.     UNCTAD had a long experience in assisting countries with trade facilitation. In this connection, it had developed various systems and programmes with real and positive impacts for countries over the years. These programmes were as follows: (a) Facilitation Programme (FALPRO): This was jointly developed between UNCTAD and the UNECE. This programme had recommendations currently in application in several countries; (b) TrainforTrade and TrainMar: These were both training programmes. The former focused on training for trade negotiations, and the latter focused on the maritime transport industry; (c) Automated System for Customs Data Entry and Management (ASYCUDA): This was software package to assist Customs administrations in countries. It was a part of a wider programme on Customs Reform and Modernization, developed within the World Customs Organization (WCO), and was supported by a number of international organizations such as the World Bank, the IMF, and the European Commission. ASYCUDA had been implemented in more than 70 countries; (d) Advance Cargo Information System (ACIS): This was logistic and a cargo tracking system, composed of several modules on ports, railways, roads, and a backbone that linked these modules. ACIS had been implemented in 15 countries, and was supported by several railway administrations, ports authorities and international donor institutions; (e) Global Trade Point Network (GTPnet): This system was developed within UNCTAD. Trade Points are focal points for practical trade transactions. They are points within a country where traders, both importers and exporters, can find commercial information. Trade Points are currently operational in 44 countries, and more are in the process of joining the system. These Trade Points had the opportunity to connect to Electronic Trade Opportunities (ETO). ETOs allow traders access to global information on potential trade opportunities. Currently, there are about 10,000 subscribers to this system which, at present, offered approximately 1,000 ETOs every week; and, (f) Transit Agreements: UNCTAD had concluded such Transit Agreements with several countries.","WTCOMTDm22.pdf","UNCTAD, UNCTAD, Customs, Data, Entry, and, Management, Customs, Customs, Reform, World, Customs, Organization, WCO, World, Bank, IMF, European, Commission, ASYCUDA, Global, Trade, Point, Network, UNCTAD, UNCTAD"
"1485",1485,"116","116.     The representative of UNCTAD stated the Organization's views of how progress could be made on trade facilitation. First, trade facilitation required synergies between the public and the private sectors, particularly in the fields of transport, trade and finance (customs). Second, trade needed to take advantage of new technologies to achieve simplification, standardization, and harmonization of operations, documentation and practices. Third, trade facilitation needed to support private initiatives. Conversely, the private sector needed to support trade facilitation.","WTCOMTDm22.pdf","UNCTAD, Organization"
"1484",1484,"115","115.     Several bureaucratic problems had been identified which impeded trade efficiency.

The delegation of Tanzania was concerned with how the funding mechanism could be improved for greater efficiency and predictability, determining the possibility for any increase in funding; and was also interested in the views of other Members. Views were being expressed that perhaps funding for technical cooperation and training activities would be better made through the regular budget, rather than the continuation with the current system of ad hoc Trust Funds. His delegation commended the developed country Members who were contributing to the various Trust Funds. On the specific Trust Funds and the contributions to these Trust Funds, his delegation expressed an interest to know the status of the pledge of US$10 million announced by the Prime-Minister of the United Kingdom at the 50th Anniversary Meeting.","WTCOMTDm22.pdf","Secretariat, Tanzania, Members, Members, United, Kingdom"

First, he assuaged the concerns raised by several delegations that had expressed anxiety that attention to small economies would divert attention away from and prejudice LDCs. In this context, he commended the representative of Tanzania for his statement. The representatives of Jamaica and Barbados had made similarly useful and constructive comments. Second, concerns had been raised about the use of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) as a measure of the development of economies. His delegation noted that the Commonwealth and the World Bank had agreed to examine any difficulties that may arise for small economies in accessing funding for development, based on the use of the GDP as a measure for development. Third, his delegation expressed its gratitude to Members of the Committee for the interest they had demonstrated in their interventions on this item. Fourth, his delegation and other co-sponsors intended to submit further ideas to reinforce the jointly circulated paper. This position had been underscored by Jamaica and Guatemala. His delegation was convinced that further ideas would assist constructive discussions at the next meeting of the Committee. Finally, the representative of Mauritius referred to the suggestion raised by the representative of Tanzania on how to give effect to the decision by WTO Ministers. His delegation agreed that practical solutions were required. In this connection, he requested Members to consider what practical solutions and steps could be taken to address the problems and concerns of small economies. These practical solutions and steps would have to be presented to the 3rd Ministerial Conference through the General Council.","WTCOMTDm22.pdf","Mauritius, LDCs, Tanzania, Jamaica, Barbados, World, Bank, Members, Committee, Jamaica, Guatemala, Committee, Mauritius, Tanzania, WTO, Members, General, Council"

New Zealand was a close neighbour to many small island, developing countries and LDCs and, therefore, was both aware and sympathetic to the concerns of these states. His delegation had participated in discussions at various fora and supported on-going work at the World Bank and other organizations, particularly on the specific issue of the vulnerability index.

His delegation would require time to study these suggestions and indicators. However, it was necessary to highlight the acute problem of increased vulnerability of small economies to the vagaries of global financial and economic conditions. This had acquired greater seriousness in the light of problems being faced by certain economies which were not necessarily ""small"". It was, therefore, necessary to recognize the seriousness of the problem of vulnerability, to address the problem and examine how it could be reduced or solved. In this context, it would also be necessary to study and find solutions to how those specific problems and characteristics that limit development could be overcome. His delegation looked forward to further in-depth discussions in the Committee on the issues raised in the jointly circulated paper.","WTCOMTDm22.pdf","India, Committee"

He agreed with previous speakers that small economies faced certain characteristic problems, and had particular concerns, all of which needed to be addressed. In fact, these concerns were specifically recognized in the Marrakesh Declaration which embodied the special and differential treatment provisions, and also recognized the importance of the implementation of these provisions for least-developed countries. His delegation recalled that three and a half years later, the 2nd WTO Ministerial Conference in paragraph 6 of its Declaration recognized the importance of addressing the problem of marginalization of certain small economies, in the context of increasing globalization.","WTCOMTDm22.pdf","India, WTO"

Comments would be preliminary since his delegation WT/COMTD/M/22 Page 22 had just received the paper. He emphasised several key points. First, Switzerland had always been concerned with the marginalization of countries and economies irrespective of size. His delegation believed that every effort should be made to avoid marginalization of countries. Addressing the problems of marginalization was a big challenge for the WTO and for trade-related technical cooperation. There was a problem with the definition of the group of small vulnerable economies, which was not self-evident. Furthermore, it was the firm belief of his delegation that the main elements of successful development lay in stable political and legal systems, within the framework of sound macro-and microeconomic policies. The experience of Switzerland itself was instructive. Switzerland was a small land-locked, net food importing country which had achieved positive results and considerable economic progress in 150 years of liberal industrial trade regime based on legal and political stability.","WTCOMTDm22.pdf","Switzerland, Switzerland, WTO, Switzerland, Switzerland"

Some of the views already expressed, in particular those of Bangladesh and Tanzania, also reflected the views of his delegation. In addition, his delegation was interested in the theme of the paper for several reasons. First, the theme of the paper was welcome per se. The Agreement establishing the WTO was a major event in international economic relations. The increasing participation of a growing number of countries, including Nepal which was a least- developed country or small economy, and a land-locked country in the WTO, reflected the current geo-centric nature of international economic relations, but also a growing faith in the WTO and in its ability to ensure that even the small and the weak can secure a share in the benefits of the system and of the growth in international trade. Second, the factor of vulnerability was important . Vulnerability emanated from a number of factors, which were sufficiently important to deserve deeper study by the Committee and the WTO. The vulnerabilities arising either from internal structural weaknesses or from external factors, needed to be studied in depth. This was necessary to ensure that participants in the multilateral trading system should not be marginalized. For these reasons, it was necessary to consider practical steps that would ensure reversal of marginalization.","WTCOMTDm22.pdf","Nepal, Bangladesh, Tanzania, WTO, Nepal, WTO, WTO, Committee, WTO"

The Secretariat's approach for the future was similarly commendable, for instance, having regard to paragraph 7 of the document which referred to ""improved productivity rate programmes"". This was important.

His delegation drew attention to paragraph 5 of the Ministerial Declaration which referred to the work of the Committee, and the agreement of the Ministers on the need for effective implementation of S&D provisions. In this context, the proposal by Morocco was relevant and urgent. The Committee should move beyond factual studies as provided in WT/COMTD/W/35. To a large extent, it should be noted, that the S&D provisions built-in to WTO Agreements had not been implemented. His delegation felt that an analytic study prepared by the Secretariat with inputs from UNCTAD would assist the Committee on Trade and Development in responding to the concern in paragraph 2 of WT/COMTD/W/35 which stated that, "" .. the Secretariat has not found it possible to insert meaningful information on the implementation of the provisions: that is the case most particularly for provisions of a preambular nature, and for provisions that call on Members autonomously to take account of the trade interests of developing country Members in the course of implementing the WTO Agreements"". Against this background, his delegation proposed, as part of the exercise to be undertaken by the Secretariat, that developed country Members should provide the Committee with information on measures that they had taken autonomously to take account of the trade interests of developing country exports. His delegation also referred to the paper on tariff peaks and tariff escalation, prepared by the WTO and UNCTAD, as providing a good example of the kind of analytical paper that was needed. His delegation was of the view that the preambular language in WTO Agreements, including the preambular language from the WTO Agreement, were integral parts of the balance of rights and obligations of WTO Members, and his delegation supported the proposal         1           The Post-Uruguay Round Tariff Environment for Developing Country exports, UNCTAD/WTO Joint Study, (TDB/B/COM.1/14).

She informed delegations that at informal consultations, her delegation had expressed its position that the matter of evaluation was an integral aspect of technical assistance.

Since this was the first time that the WTO was introducing a Trainee programme, the Secretariat and Netherlands had agreed to start with a modest number of 3 trainees per year, in order to keep things manageable and to learn from experience. After an initial period of 2 years the programme would be evaluated. In the coming weeks, the WTO Secretariat would establish the implementation modalities, in particular in the area of selection and recruitment, the development of tailor-made programmes and the supervision of the trainees.

The evaluation should aim at three objectives. First, the Committee, with the assistance of the Secretariat, should assess the difficulties encountered by developing, least-developed and developed countries in the implementation of the S&D provisions. Second, the real impact and the real implications of these provisions on the trade and economies of developing countries should be evaluated to determine whether the expectations held at the time the provisions had been adopted had been met. Third, there should be an assessment of the concept of S&D, the extent to which the concept had been well established, its relevance, and any scope for improvement in the light of rapid changes in the structure of international trade relations. If the concept was no longer relevant, then the initial expectations would not be met and the risk of marginalization would increase. Evaluation was essential. Such evaluation could be conducted with Secretariat proposals and with the assistance of other international organizations such as UNCTAD.

Apart from UNCTAD and ITC, there were other relevant organizations which were engaged, including the ITU, United Nations Commission on International Trade Law (UNCITRAL), WIPO, etc. Egypt's main concern was the position taken by those who wanted to await the results of the General Council in establishing an overall work programme before work began in the Committee. If this was the case, it meant that the Committee would have to wait until September. Thereafter, the Committee could only begin work later on in the year to request the Secretariat to produce a paper, and UNCTAD to make its contributions. This, inevitably, would shift the process to 1999. This shift would not only slow down the process, but could also not be reconciled with the position of those delegations who were urging quick movement on this and other issues. His delegation emphasised, for the record, that the development perspective was a fundamental prerequisite to any discussion on the subject of electronic commerce. If electronic commerce was not addressed in a comprehensive WT/COMTD/M/21 Page 12 and balanced manner, that satisfied Egypt's concerns, then Egypt should not be blamed if it was unable to join in any conclusions on this important issue for the Third Ministerial Conference.

In doing so, the economic, financial and the development needs of developing countries should also be taken into account which further highlighted the important role to be played by the Committee on Trade and Development. Nonetheless, Members should ensure that the General Council identified the overall work programme in September. Elsewhere, such as in UNCTAD, the subject was gaining momentum. For instance, in UNCTAD consideration was being accorded to obstacles confronted by developing countries in electronic commerce. Other Organizations could also make useful inputs such as in the ITU and the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO). His delegation considered that it would be possible for the Committee to suggest to the General Council that certain parameters for examining the subject be set-out. This approach could assist the General Council in establishing an overall work programme in September. While noting that Mexico had suggested an informal meeting to consider all aspects of the work, Uruguay took the view that it was up to the General Council to determine the final work programme.","WTCOMTDM21.pdf","Uruguay, Committee, Committee, on, Trade, and, Development, Committee, on, Trade, and, Development, Members, General, Council, UNCTAD, UNCTAD, ITU, World, Intellectual, Property, Organization, WIPO, Committee, General, Council, General, Council, Mexico, Uruguay, General, Council"
"1437",1437,"50","50.     The representative of Ecuador stated that the Committee should accord due consideration to the points raised by the Tanzanian Ambassador. His delegation noted that some Members had counselled caution. However, to maintain the momentum of work in this area and to strengthen the overall process, the Committee should not become immobilised. Drive and impetus in the consideration of the subject of electronic commerce needed to be maintained. To this need, his delegation gave support to the proposals by Egypt.","WTCOMTDM21.pdf","Ecuador, Committee, Ambassador, Members, Committee, Egypt"
"1436",1436,"5","5.      The representative of Morocco said his delegation attached importance to the implementation of S&D provisions in the WTO agreements and in special Ministerial Decisions in favour of developing countries, in particular the least-developed. These provisions were integral parts of the Agreements and Decisions and were intended to strike a balance between countries at different levels of development. His delegation welcomed the Secretariat document, and had observed from it that a large part of these provisions had not been implemented, and in fact could not be implemented.","WTCOMTDM21.pdf","Morocco, WTO, Secretariat"
"1435",1435,"49","49.     The representative of Mexico underscored three points. First, electronic commerce was an important subject in international markets. All countries, including the developed countries, needed to subject it to careful examination in order to assess its impact, particularly on development. Second, the Egyptian paper was extremely useful, as was the WTO Secretariat study. Since the Committee on Trade and Development had already initiated work and made some progress, particularly on the development aspects, it should continue.            Account needed to be taken of whatever the General Council proposed. Third, the Secretariat should produce a factual paper on the lines suggested by the Egyptian delegation. His delegation considered that the Chairman should convene an informal meeting, after the regular meeting of the General Council to examine the factual paper by the WTO and also the Egyptian paper. There should also be inputs from Members and from the UNCTAD. The results of this informal meeting could then be conveyed to the General Council in                                                                                   WT/COMTD/M/21                                                                                          Page 11 September, by the Chairman. The discussions at the informal meeting would bring more focus to the work of the Committee on Trade and Development and the General Council itself.","WTCOMTDM21.pdf","Mexico, WTO, Secretariat, Committee, on, Trade, and, Development, General, Council, Secretariat, Chairman, General, Council, WTO, Members, UNCTAD, General, Council, Chairman, Committee, on, Trade, and, Development, General, Council"
"1434",1434,"48","48.      The representative of Canada noted that the points raised by Egypt would be worth pursuing. Timing was essential. Canada's preference was that work in the Committee should be postponed until after the Special Session of the General Council in September. Members should make sure that the work programme reflected development concerns as outlined in the Ministerial Declaration. The Committee on Trade and Development would have an important role to play in the implementation of the work programme.","WTCOMTDM21.pdf","Canada, Egypt, Canada, Committee, General, Council, Members, Committee, on, Trade, and, Development"
"1433",1433,"47","47.      The representative of Australia appealed for coherence in the work of the different WTO bodies on electronic commerce. Work in the Committee on Trade and Development was not parallel to or an annex to work in the General Council, but an integral part of the work of the General Council. Members should not be concerned about what the General Council would do because Members of the Committee were also the Members of the General Council. Her delegation observed that the Egyptian paper contained key elements that could form part of the Committee's work programme. Morocco's intervention had also highlighted some other issues in electronic commerce. Australia would urge Members to make inputs into the General Council's work programme. Her delegation was concerned that some thought that a vacuum existed. Australia considered that no such vacuum existed. The Committee on Trade and Development could begin to examine indent three of the Egyptian proposal, and also begin to consider the dimension of technical cooperation. Her delegation agreed with Hong Kong, China, on approaches. Her delegation agreed that the proposed seminar and special session on electronic commerce were good ideas, but it would be essential to first have the picture of an overall integral work programme.","WTCOMTDM21.pdf","Australia, WTO, Committee, on, Trade, and, Development, General, Council, General, Council, Members, General, Council, Members, Committee, Members, General, Council, Committee, Morocco, Australia, Members, General, Council, Australia, Committee, on, Trade, and, Development, Hong, Kong, China"
"1432",1432,"46","46.      The representative of India welcomed the Egyptian proposals. His delegation emphasised four points. First, it noted that the proposals by Egypt had been properly inscribed on the Committee's agenda four months previously, and were therefore consistent with the procedures of the Committee. The intention of the paper to focus on the development dimension of electronic commerce was very important. The Egyptian paper was entirely consistent with both the procedures of the Committee and with the mandate of the Ministerial Declaration. Second, the proposals contained in paragraph 49 of the Egyptian paper were all extremely important. India considered that the factual paper, as requested in the first indent of the Egyptian paper, should be prepared by the Secretariat. His delegation noted that reference had been made to the study produced by the Secretariat, but it had expressed its view at an earlier meeting that the development dimension had not been adequately addressed in that paper. He felt that the second and fifth indents in the Egyptian paper could be combined. Third, his delegation supported the idea of a seminar, and this idea did not have to wait for the Special Session of the General Council. His delegation was also interested in a special session of the Committee on Trade and Development because it would assist Members in focusing on the development dimension of the issue. His delegation requested the Chairman to consult on the special session. Fourth, the representative of India noted that the functioning of the General Council should not restrict the Committee on Trade and Development. If any difficulties arose, India felt that the Chairman of the Committee on Trade and Development could take the floor to inform the General Council of the work being done in the Committee.","WTCOMTDM21.pdf","India, Egypt, Committee, Committee, Committee, India, Secretariat, Secretariat, General, Council, Committee, on, Trade, and, Development, Members, Chairman, India, General, Council, Committee, on, Trade, and, Development, India, Chairman, Committee, on, Trade, and, Development, General, Council, Committee"
"1431",1431,"45","45.      The representative of Japan welcomed the paper by Egypt. Electronic commerce was important for the further development of developing countries. The issues raised by the representative of Switzerland on the need for being methodical and for coherence in the work of the WTO were important. His delegation emphasised the importance of an overall work programme as contained in the Ministerial Declaration. Duplication must be avoided both in the WTO and with other international fora. Work and experience elsewhere could be usefully tapped, for instance, at UNCTAD. His delegation suggested that a contribution should be received from UNCTAD before work commenced. He referred to the meeting being organized by UNCTAD in the autumn, a ""Partnership for Development Summit"" meeting in Glion. His delegation understood that substantial attention, at this meeting, would be devoted to electronic commerce. UNCTAD had worked extensively in this area, and its experience would be useful. This was particularly relevant with regard to indent two in paragraph 49 of the Egyptian paper. His delegation considered that a special meeting of the Committee on Trade and Development dedicated to electronic commerce was a good one. However, such a meeting should take place after the Special Session of the General Council. Duplication must be avoided in the work of WTO bodies. To this end, work in the Committee must be complementary to work in the General Council.

"1430",1430,"44","44.     The representative of Hong Kong, China welcomed the paper by Egypt. He said that electronic commerce potentially covered a wide area of WTO activity, and also covered a wide area of activity by other organizations and national governments. The Special Session of the General Council in September would need to consider how best to handle WTO work. His delegation would not rule out any of the options that had been suggested on how work would proceed. However, given that the subject was complex and wide-ranging, some caution was merited. Hong Kong, China, expressed satisfaction on the Secretariat paper that had been presented, and wondered if the Secretariat could actually do more, in the light of the fact that Members needed to further consider the item and take some policy decisions. His delegation suggested that bullet points two and three of paragraph 49 of the WT/COMTD/W/35 could be started immediately. The last two bullets could require a special seminar and therefore could wait until after the Special Session of the General Council.","WTCOMTDM21.pdf","Hong, Kong, China, Egypt, WTO, General, Council, WTO, Hong, Kong, China, Secretariat, Secretariat, Members, General, Council"
"1429",1429,"43","43.     The Communities also re-iterated several areas of importance contained in the presentation by Egypt, including the importance of having correct and proper infrastructure and increasing the participation of developing countries in line with various WTO provisions, such as Article 4 of the GATS. The period between now and the Special Session in September was very short. Although her delegation believed that holding a special session of the Committee on Trade and Development at this time was premature, work on other aspects could start immediately. The Secretariat could begin the preparation of factual and analytical papers, tapping on the resources and contributions of other organizations such as UNCTAD. The proposals by Egypt were necessary and useful, but needed proper timing to ensure work efficiency. The Communities reminded Members that they had also put forward several proposals in their paper on which they desired the view of Members. In this regard, her delegation informed Members that they were available for informal discussions on any ideas by Members on the proposals presented by the European Communities.","WTCOMTDM21.pdf","Egypt, WTO, GATS, Committee, on, Trade, and, Development, Secretariat, UNCTAD, Egypt, Members, Members, Members, Members, European, Communities"
"1428",1428,"42","42.     The representative of the European Communities stated that her delegation had now had the time to consider the Egyptian proposals and saw merit in the suggestions. The Communities would accord varying emphasis on different aspects, for instance on mode of delivery, the impact of                                                                                    WT/COMTD/M/21                                                                                            Page 9 electronic commerce on trade, the role of government, and what space there would be for regulation. All these issues had to be addressed, and the outcome was still far away. Her delegation believed that the Ministerial Declaration was useful in the sense that it provided an indicative deadline for the consideration of electronic commerce. This indication would assist in focusing the mind of delegations on the work programme. Her delegation considered that the Committee should contribute to the decision to be adopted by the General Council in September. The Declaration did not restrict work to a particular body, but mentioned bodies of the WTO. The Egyptian paper covered many points which the work programme could take into account. A role existed for the Committee. For example, the second bullet of paragraph 8 of the Egyptian paper pointed to an important angle of consideration by the Committee.","WTCOMTDM21.pdf","Committee, General, Council, WTO, Committee, Committee"
"1427",1427,"41","41.      The representative of Switzerland noted that although new interests tended to excite, nonetheless, there was a need to proceed methodically. Ministers had mandated the General Council to prepare a work programme. Therefore, the Committee should wait for the General Council to draw up a work programme before it began work on electronic commerce or requested the Secretariat to prepare studies. It was likely that the work programme to be drawn up by the General Council would include a large part if not all of the Egyptian proposals. Switzerland would like to avoid the situation in which different WTO bodies decided their own work programmes, and requested the Secretariat to prepare studies which may overlap.","WTCOMTDM21.pdf","Switzerland, General, Council, Committee, General, Council, Secretariat, General, Council, Switzerland, WTO, Secretariat"
"1426",1426,"40","40.      The representative of Morocco welcomed the Egyptian paper and expressed support for the efforts of Egypt to conduct an educational exercise on the issue for Members in the Committee before decisions were taken on the subject. It supported the Egyptian proposals. To a considerable degree, the paper covered developing country concerns, although there were some issues and difficulties not reflected in the document. First, there was the difficulty that several countries did not yet have competition law or policy. The debate proposed by Egypt and the analysis requested would have a positive effect because it would assist competent authorities to adapt their legislation to trends in electronic commerce. Second, it was still unclear how fiscal and taxation policies would be managed in electronic commerce. His delegation had taken note of the proposal by the U.S. Third, there was the difficulty of correctly managing the infrastructure in order to make it possible for developing countries to integrate into this infrastructure, and thus forestall any further marginalization of developing countries. His delegation had more concerns. These would be raised and coordinated with Egypt. Morocco supported the Egyptian proposal for a special session of the Committee on Trade and Development to address the subject of the electronic commerce. Finally, his delegation emphasised the importance of inter-organizational cooperation and the mobilization of synergies in order to avoid overlap and duplication. The organizations that could usefully cooperate on this subject included UNCTAD, WTO and International Telecommunications Union (ITU).","WTCOMTDM21.pdf","Morocco, Egypt, Members, Committee, Egypt, U.S., Egypt, Morocco, Committee, on, Trade, and, Development, UNCTAD, WTO, International, Telecommunications, Union, ITU"
"1425",1425,"4","4.      Second, informal consultations showed that some delegations believed it would be useful for the Committee to discuss the issue of ""special and differential"" treatment (S&D) not only in the context of the implementation of various provisions in individual WTO Agreements, but also at a broad, conceptual level.

"1424",1424,"39","39.      The representative of Brazil noted the caution hinted at by the United States, and agreed this was necessary. However, the Committee should not be idle on the subject while waiting for the General Council, nor feel hindered by the fact that the General Council had not yet decided on the structure and scope of the work programme. It was useful to know that there was a lot of informal activity that was already taking place. His delegation was not aware of these informal activities and consultations. He believed that Members had to discuss the subjects fully, and acquire a knowledge of what they were negotiating and what the stakes were. He recalled that one of the reasons for the difficulty in negotiating the draft Ministerial Declaration was the fact that in many instances, delegations did not know what the implications were and also, in several instances, did not know what the proposals were. Members of the Committee should be fully involved, and the development needs of the developing countries should be fully taken into account. Brazil regretted that there had been no response yet to the requests made by the Egyptian delegation four months ago. It was further regrettable that the Committee was still at the stage of discussing ""starting work"". Brazil, therefore, supported the Egyptian proposal that work should begin immediately.","WTCOMTDM21.pdf","Brazil, United, States, Committee, General, Council, General, Council, Members, Members, Committee, Brazil, Committee, Brazil"
"1423",1423,"38","38.    The representative of the United States agreed that the Committee on Trade and Development had a clear role and responsibility in the work programme decided by Ministers on electronic commerce. Egypt's paper was constructive. Evidently, the issues raised by Egypt would be part of the work programme. At the same time, Members must be deferential to the process in the General Council, and allow the Council to determine the specific responsibilities of different bodies. However, his delegation believed that some activity could go on in the interim. First, the Committee could begin immediately to consider the role of electronic commerce in technical cooperation. Second, it would be useful to be informed of work by UNCTAD. UNCTAD could be asked to WT/COMTD/M/21 Page 8 provide a paper for the information of the Committee on its activity, in order to avoid duplication and overlap. Third, the United States would support the proposal for a special Committee meeting or seminar on electronic commerce as part of the work programme of the Committee on Trade and Development. Fourth, it was early to respond to Tanzania's question as to whether there will be a special body to address the subject of electronic commerce, but even informally his delegation had not understood that there would be any proposals to that effect. However, his delegation would counsel patience until the General Council had taken a decision apportioning responsibilities.","WTCOMTDM21.pdf","United, States, Committee, on, Trade, and, Development, Egypt, Egypt, Members, General, Council, Council, Committee, UNCTAD, UNCTAD, Committee, United, States, Committee, Committee, on, Trade, and, Development, Tanzania, General, Council"
"1422",1422,"37","37.      He emphasised the importance of addressing the issue of the enhanced participation of developing countries in electronic commerce. He provided information to the Committee on the meeting that was hosted by the Economic Commission for Africa (ECA), on the essential issues relating to the provision of cost-effective global connectivity, and computer/internet access to the poor, in particular women. At this Conference, the World Bank estimated that the challenge of providing the poor with information technology involved raising connectivity rates from 5 lines per 1,000 to 5 lines per 100. It was observed that China had been able to accomplish this target. China had a penetration of 8 lines per 100. Initially, when Africa was connected to the internet, only the educated and the wealthy had access to information technology. This pattern had not significantly changed. The urgent objective was to connect the poor. A 1995 African regional symposium on telecommunications and development had stressed the importance of building Africa's information infrastructure. At that time, only four African countries had full internet connectivity; in 1997, 47 countries achieved full internet connectivity. Experts had proposed that the profile of Africa's internet and information technology connectivity needed to be changed through better infrastructures, more effective government policies, innovative educational programmes to access the majority of people, and ensuring that the poor and the young could also benefit from this technology. This was a crucial and dynamic area. Much had been accomplished in various international organizations. The WTO had a role to play, in particular in relation to internet trade-related issues.","WTCOMTDM21.pdf","Committee, Economic, Commission, Africa, ECA, World, Bank, China, China, Africa, Africa, Africa, WTO"
"1421",1421,"36","36.     The representative of Egypt recognised the importance of the point raised by Tanzania. Nonetheless, he recalled that there were five requests in paragraph 49 of the Egyptian paper – WT/COMTD/W/38. Some of these could overlap with the process that might take place in the General Council. In spite of this possibility, Egypt believed that work could begin in the Committee since the subject had been discussed in the Committee on Trade and Development, and their paper had been presented months previously, and that the process should start with the Secretariat preparing the analytical paper which his delegation had requested. The Ministerial Declaration stated that work could begin in the relevant WTO bodies taking into account the development needs of the developing countries.","WTCOMTDM21.pdf","Egypt, Tanzania, General, Council, Egypt, Committee, Committee, on, Trade, and, Development, Secretariat, WTO"
"1420",1420,"35","35.      The Chairman noted that the Ministerial Council was the highest WTO body; accordingly, its decision was final. However, he also noted that the text of the Ministerial Declaration on electronic commerce included the phrase that, ""The work programme will involve the relevant World Trade Organization (""WTO"") bodies"". The Chairman assumed that this phrase very clearly encompassed the Committee on Trade and Development.

"1419",1419,"34","34.      The representative of Tanzania requested clarification on how to proceed with the discussions on electronic commerce in the light of the language by Ministers in the Ministerial Declaration instructing the General Council to: ""establish a comprehensive work programme to examine all trade- related issues relating to global electronic commerce"". His delegation requested a clarification as to whether this instruction implied that a special working group would be established, or that the Committee Trade and Development should proceed without further delay? His delegation understood paragraph 7 of the Egyptian paper to suggest that it was within the mandate of the Committee to discuss electronic commerce.","WTCOMTDM21.pdf","Tanzania, General, Council, Committee, Trade, and, Development, Committee"
"1418",1418,"33","33.     The Chairman called for comments focusing mainly on how work could be usefully done on this subject in the Committee on Trade and Development, bearing in mind the need to avoid overlap with other WTO bodies and to avoid duplication of work with other organisations.

"1417",1417,"32","32.     Finally, the Chairman recalled his informal consultations on 24 April, 1998, at which he sought the views of delegations on how he might best proceed with the subject. At the informal consultations he had drawn two conclusions. First, there was a widely-shared need for an educational process on electronic commerce; to this end, account should be taken of work in other organizations, notably UNCTAD. Second, Members needed to avoid unnecessary overlap amongst different WTO bodies in discussing electronic commerce.","WTCOMTDM21.pdf","Chairman, UNCTAD, Members, WTO"
"1416",1416,"31","31.      At the time the Committee had last discussed the subject of electronic commerce formally, it had anticipated a study by the WTO Secretariat on the subject.

First, there was concern, among developing and developed country Members alike, about problems that the developing countries, in particular the least-developed among them, may have encountered in implementing their Uruguay Round obligations within the special transition periods that had been provided. The Chairman reminded delegations that problems encountered in the course of implementation was an issue to which individual Ministers, at the recent WTO Ministerial Conference had referred. In addition, paragraph 8 of the Ministerial Declaration stated: ""When we meet at the Third Session we shall further pursue our evaluation of the implementation of individual agreements and the realization of their objectives. Such evaluation would cover, inter alia, the problems encountered in implementation and the consequent impact on the trade and development prospects of Members"". Also, the Director-General made reference to this issue in his Report to Ministers on the High-Level Meeting for the Least-Developed Countries: ""Without a strong commitment by WTO Members to finance in the budget the growing needs of technical assistance in an appropriate way, the essential objective of implementation of commitments made in the Uruguay Round, especially by the developing and least-developed countries, could be in serious jeopardy"".","WTCOMTDM21.pdf","Members, Uruguay, Round, Chairman, WTO, Ministerial, Conference, Members, Director-General, WTO, Members, Uruguay, Round"

The Chairman agreed to undertake informal consultations in respect of the three proposals by Morocco on S&D, and on why, and in what areas, the developed countries had encountered difficulties in implementing the special provisions in favour of developing countries. He invited the Secretariat to conduct informal consultations with all interested delegations on the issue of an appropriate accommodation under WTO provisions for autonomous improvements in market access in favour of least-developed countries, and to keep him abreast of the consultations.","WTCOMTDM21.pdf","Chairman, Morocco, S&D, Secretariat, WTO"

Second, the statement by the United States was positive and constructive. His delegation wanted to avoid North-South confrontation, which was not the objective of their proposal. Morocco simply sought a functional, positive and constructive dialogue. Third, several international organizations such as the IMF, the World Bank, UNDP and WT/COMTD/M/21 Page 6 UNCTAD regularly conducted assessments of the impact of their decisions on the trade of developing countries. The WTO could also do the same. Finally, his delegation requested the Secretariat to assist the Committee in the evaluation exercise by providing a structure and framework for the discussions, in the absence of which the discussions in the Committee could be disorganized.","WTCOMTDM21.pdf","Morocco, United, States, Morocco, IMF, World, Bank, UNDP, UNCTAD, WTO, Secretariat, Committee, Committee"
"1409",1409,"25","25.      The representative of the Republic of Korea narrated his delegation's experience as a guide on how best to proceed. Members should focus on specific problems and difficulties of implementation. At the High-Level Meeting his delegation had announced commitments to provide special treatment to least-developed countries. However, implementing the commitments presented difficulties similar to those experienced by other developing countries. The problem was that there appeared to be no firm legal basis in WTO rules for accommodating commitments for autonomous market access improvements, including under the so called Enabling Clause. Existing provisions appeared insufficient. There was a strong will on the part of various developed and developing countries, like Korea, to implement the measures, but in a rule-based organization, such as the WTO, Korea wanted to act in accordance with the rules. This was the reason that Korea had not yet finalized its implementation of its commitments. Therefore, rather than waste time by requesting the Secretariat to provide assessment papers, countries that encountered difficulties should clearly state the difficulties, just as Korea had done. To this end, frank informal consultations would be more fruitful than formal meetings in addressing problems encountered in the application of the special provisions.","WTCOMTDM21.pdf","Republic, of, Korea, Members, WTO, Korea, WTO, Korea, Korea, Secretariat, Korea"
"1408",1408,"24","24.      The representative of Australia iterated two specific principles underpinning its position. First, the work of the WTO should be Member-driven. To this end, contributions by Members should identify issues and focus on particular problems given the large scope of issues in the area under consideration. Second, the Committee should proceed cautiously, sensibly and with perspective. The work of the Committee should be anchored on concrete experiences, practical issues, and clear questions. This would ensure the most constructive and productive discussions possible and yield real results.

The Committee needed to understand the different approaches and gain from the experiences of other, for instance UNCTAD. UNCTAD had considerable experience in development, and could make useful contributions to the analysis envisaged. It was also necessary to consider the development impact of the S&D provisions. The Committee was now moving to a new stage of its work, and needed to take a broader view.","WTCOMTDM21.pdf","Mexico, Committee, UNCTAD, UNCTAD, Committee"

The concerns of developing countries should not be ruled out. If developing countries wanted a broader debate, their preference for this approach should be accommodated. Brazil had noted that several countries wanted an ambitious agenda for the next trade round. These countries should note that others wanted a proper assessment of the status of implementation before proceeding further. His delegation was convinced that the informal consultations by the Chairman would be productive, and Brazil desired to participate.","WTCOMTDM21.pdf","Brazil, Uruguay, Uruguay, Brazil, Chairman, Brazil"

The representative of Norway emphasised that although his delegation did not disagree with the Moroccan proposals to evaluate the impact of the special provisions, nonetheless it preferred a modified approach in which concerned countries, particularly developing countries, outlined their concrete experiences.

The representative of Mauritius underlined the vital importance of implementation particularly the provisions in favour of developing countries, and to this end welcomed the proposals by Morocco. He favoured the caveat by the United States and Tanzania on the need to proceed with caution. His delegation had noted that in all declarations and Ministerial statements, developing countries had stated that they were encountering problems with regard to implementation. However, it was the duty of developing countries to identify concrete areas and submit proposals where they were having problems. Thereupon, consideration would be given to possible solutions, improvements and adjustments.

The representative of Japan stressed the importance which his delegation attached to the special provisions, and to the implementation of WTO Agreements in the era of globalization. While a basis was required for further work, the Secretariat could not be expected to prepare every sort of analysis. Some types of analysis needed to be Member-driven. To this end, his delegation would like to determine from developing countries and least-developed countries what particular issues they would like to study.

The representative of Tanzania supported the Moroccan proposal that the Committee should go beyond factual reporting of the implementation of special provisions and evaluating their impact, and also supported Bangladesh, on behalf of the least-developed countries for a mechanism to evaluate implementation. The Secretariat needed to take note of this concern. He supported the position of the United States that the Committee should not rush into an overall evaluation of the special provisions, but proceed cautiously. Fundamental questions could arise, such as who qualifies for S&D, which could be counterproductive. Tanzania emphasised that while the current discussions focused on implementation with regard to S&D, there was a need to focus on the overall problems regarding implementation, and thereupon search for solutions. This approach had been mandated by the Ministerial Conference. Problems and difficulties should be identified and collated by the Secretariat, and then discussed at the level of the General Council.","WTCOMTDM21.pdf","Tanzania, Committee, Bangladesh, Secretariat, United, States, Committee, Tanzania, Secretariat, General, Council"

The problems addressed should be brought to the Committee by the affected countries. In response, therefore, to Morocco's proposal for a more analytical and conceptual exercise, her delegation preferred avoiding an abstract exercise and also avoiding a confrontational exchange of views. The Moroccan proposals required further reflection, and her delegation supported informal consultations to further address the proposals.","WTCOMTDM21.pdf","Switzerland, Committee, Morocco"

The representative of Canada underscored the importance of implementation, including the implementation of S&D provisions to ensure that the benefits of the multilateral trading system were WT/COMTD/M/21 Page 4 widely shared. Her delegation noted that the importance of implementation had been underscored at the First Meeting of African Trade Ministers, as contained in the Report of that meeting, circulated by the Permanent Mission of Zimbabwe in WT/COMTD/W/43. Her delegation urged other developing countries to follow the example of African countries in conducting national assessments of the implementation of the Uruguay Round Agreements.

However, her delegation welcomed the proposal in relation to its intention to focus on the issue of implementation.          The European Communities were committed to implementation, which was an essential part of WTO operations. To this end, difficulties that arose should be addressed. In order to be effective, her delegation was in favour of focusing on specific issues and identifying particular problem areas as opposed to open-ended general discussions.

There could be counterproductive implications to such broad, generic discussions, as in the 1980s. They could produce a North-South divide, and inhibit progress by both developed and developing countries. He considered that the S&D discussion could be more productive if focused on specific issues and situations. The parameters of the discussions would be to determine if the S&D provisions in the WTO Agreements were workable, and, if they were not, how they could be improved. The Committee should avoid controversy, and understand that there were limitations on tasks for the Secretariat as opposed to what Members could do.","WTCOMTDM21.pdf","WTO, Committee, Secretariat, Members"

The proposals were useful because they helped to focus on further work. On the first issue, it was clear that all countries faced challenges in implementing the special provisions. In this connection, further discussions would be fruitful because it would identify the difficulties, highlight the concerns and frustrations of both developed and developing countries in failing to implement certain provisions. His delegation considered that it was not the job of the Secretariat to collate such matters. Members should state their specific concerns.

Bangladesh believed that there was a legal and practical necessity to undertake the evaluation and analysis that had been requested because full implementation of the special provisions was essential to the integration of the least-developed countries into the multilateral trading system. Although the Secretariat Note WT/COMTD/W/35 had pointed out that preambular language could not be meaningfully applied, yet they constituted integral parts of the WTO Agreements. The implementation of the special provisions was a matter of vital interest for Bangladesh.

The representative of the Philippines drew the attention of delegates to the discussions being held at the meeting of Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC) on coordination and cooperation between the various intergovernmental organizations. She stated that with respect to technical cooperation, closer relationship between the United Nations, its specialized agencies and functional commissions, and the WTO was feasible, and that the relationship between the WTO and the UN, as agreed to by WTO Members, did allow for such closer collaboration. She was of the view that more work could be done on how to coordinate technical cooperation activities, so as to avoid overlapping in some areas and lack of assistance in other areas. With respect to the objectives of technical assistance and its programming in a given year, she pointed out that while reports on technical assistance were submitted to ECOSOC, this happened only once a year during meetings of ECOSOC. She cautioned that unless the WTO was able to plan its technical assistance activities for the entire year in advance, effective coordination of activities with other organizations would be quite difficult, unless a formal understanding was reached with them to meet at least on a quarterly basis. Coordination could help to solve some of the WTO constraints relating to funding, as some of the UN organizations had the necessary funds at their disposal. She stressed the importance of technical assistance in providing meaningful training to officials from developing countries and helping them in the formulation of policies. She also stated that long-term planning of technical cooperation activities was necessary, especially where a seminar was jointly being planned and organized by two or more institutions. Developing countries needed more than ever technical assistance directed towards enhancing their competitiveness after the implementation of the Uruguay Round Agreements.

A number of representatives stated that the seminar on notification requirements was helpful and encouraged similar workshops to be held from time to time.

The representative of the United States expressed his delegation's disappointment with the cancellation of the scheduled 12-13 June meeting of the Working Party on MERCOSUR, particularly since the Parties to the Agreement cancelled it with only two days notice. Considerable time and effort had been put into the preparation of the meeting by the Secretariat, participating delegations, and the Parties themselves. Further, cancellation on such short notice required the Secretariat to pay the interpreters for the meeting. The United States had a strong interest in MERCOSUR and would like to begin reviewing the Agreement as soon as possible. To that end, his delegation hoped that a date in early September could be secured for such a meeting and asked that MERCOSUR members confirm a time when they would be ready to respond to the questions of the Working Party. He indicated that in the process of preparing for the scheduled June Working Party meeting, his government noted that the Parties to the Agreement had failed to provide certain pertinent information. Specifically, information necessary to evaluate MERCOSUR tariff commitments against the WTO obligations of the four MERCOSUR members was being sought. This information would have to include three years of trade data by 8-digit tariff line, specifying individual partner trade, bound, applied and preferential duty rates for each country, as well as concordance between the nomenclature of each country's Uruguay Round tariff schedule and the MERCOSUR common external tariff nomenclature. His delegation would ask the MERCOSUR parties to provide that data to members of the Working Party and to the Secretariat as soon as possible. Finally, his delegation would also ask the Secretariat to begin the tariff analysis for customs unions required in paragraph 5 of the WTO Understanding on Article XXIV. He stressed the importance of the analysis for the work of the Working Party.

Surveying the world scene, he was struck by the paradox that has taken root in the developing world. For the past ten to fifteen years or even longer, most developing countries have been involved in reforming and restructuring programmes - under the aegis of the World Bank or the IMF, or independently - with the view to integrating themselves more fully into world trade. Developed countries restructured when it was politically and economically expedient. The WTO needed a machinery, which would be parallel to Article XXVIII, for dealing with tariffs independently reduced by Members. There was no logical explanation why a Member would be obliged to offer compensation anytime it increased its tariffs, but would not get compensation when it reduced its tariffs. The current situation could not be justified, especially considering that the benefits would mainly accrue to the trading partners, and in certain instances the main supplier. Compensation would have to be provided by the main beneficiaries of the liberalization measures undertaken. WT/COMTD/M/2 Page 8","WTCOMTDM2.pdf","Morocco, World, Bank, IMF, WTO, Members, Member"

The representative of the European Communities stated that the EC considered that the question of credit had been dealt with in the Uruguay Round negotiations, and that the results took due account of the request for credit. Furthermore, the Agreements contained many other provisions which provided for differential treatment in favour of developing countries. The EC appreciated autonomous liberalization efforts, but it thought that, in the first place, liberalization benefitted the liberalizing country itself. It would be difficult to see how the Committee could discuss further an issue that was largely dealt with in the Uruguay Round.","WTCOMTDM2.pdf","European, Communities, EC, Uruguay, EC, Committee, Uruguay, Round"

The representative of Malaysia, speaking on behalf of ASEAN countries, recalled that ASEAN had been one of the sponsors of credit and recognition for autonomous liberalization measures, and that they continued to strongly support this concept. Unfortunately, previous deliberations had not advanced the implementation of this concept. As a result, ASEAN countries considered the issue as being one of the unfinished business of the Uruguay Round. They were of the view that the time had come to seriously think of ways of translating this concept into reality by finding a long-term solution. There was the need to accommodate autonomous liberalization measures within the WTO, especially considering that developing countries were now actively participating in the activities of the WTO. He noted that developing countries were pursuing liberal policies and undertaking liberalization initiatives with the belief that these measures would contribute towards their development efforts. These measures did not stop with the conclusion of the Uruguay Round, but were continuing, for example, under the programmes of the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF). Developing countries would feel more encouraged to liberalize if their initiatives were being recognized or given credit without having to wait for another round of negotiations. To ensure that progress was achieved, the concept of providing credit and recognition to autonomous liberalization measures should be operationalized.

The representative of Mexico recalled that her delegation was interested in this issue and particularly interested in the issues raised in paragraphs 14 and 15 of document WT/COMTD/W/4, i.e. the mechanics of crediting a country for autonomous measures undertaken by it. The credit and recognition of autonomous measures adopted by developing countries was a matter of great importance, as it could have a positive effect on the trade policies of most developing countries, especially where they receive improved market access without having to wait for any future multilateral negotiations. Mexico was interested in reviewing this subject and hoped that at a future meeting it could contribute effectively by advancing practical solutions.","WTCOMTDM2.pdf","Mexico, Mexico"
"1360",1360,"25","25.      The representative of Japan stated that his country welcomed any autonomous trade liberalization measures adopted by developing countries; it was important for other countries to show appreciation by encouraging developing countries to continue with their liberalization efforts notwithstanding the domestic pressures that they may face. However, dealing with ""credit and recognition"" after the conclusion of the Uruguay Round should be based a balanced approach. He supported his argument by saying that first, discussions on ""credit and recognition"" during the Uruguay Round negotiations were to some extent made to enhance the contribution of developing countries in the market access negotiations on goods. These were made under circumstances where it was thought that consideration should be given to the special situation of developing countries while, in principle, market access negotiations should be conducted on a reciprocal basis. It would fly in the face of all established principles if the same approach was to be followed after the Uruguay Round. Second, it was very difficult to give an objective judgment to autonomous liberalizing measures taken by a country when the appreciation of these measures was largely influenced by the interests of the respective trade partners. For that reason, guidelines - as distinct from formal rules - were presented by the Chairman of the Market Access Group, as a means to improve the contribution of the developing countries. They could not be established as the general rule. Japan believed that within the framework of the WTO, developing countries already enjoyed a ""Special and Differential"" treatment. If one allowed only developing countries to have ""credit and recognition"" for liberalization measures, it could affect the balance of rights and obligations between developing and developed countries.

"1359",1359,"24","24.      The Chairman stated that, at the time of the adoption of the terms of reference for this Committee, it was also agreed that ""the programme of work of the WTO Committee on Trade and Development for 1995 would ... also include consideration of the question of credit and recognition for autonomous trade liberalization measures"". It was his view that the CTD would be able to achieve a meaningful result in this area. Without wishing to pre-empt the results of the CTD discussions, he stated that as one of the mandates of the WTO was to ensure increased coherence in global economic policy-making and intensify cooperation between the WTO and the two Bretton Woods Institutions, concrete results on the question of credit and recognition would demonstrate the carrying out of this mandate. Document WT/COMTD/W/4 (and Corr. 1 in the English version), which attempted to crystallize the issues involved under credit and recognition, would be a very useful guide for the debate, not only because of its exhaustiveness in detailing how the issue was dealt with during the Uruguay Round, but even more important, because of the identification of the context in which credit and recognition should be dealt with in the WTO. Delegations expressed their appreciation for the document.","WTCOMTDM2.pdf","Chairman, Committee, WTO, Committee, on, Trade, and, Development, CTD, CTD, WTO, WTO, Bretton, Woods, Institutions, Corr, Uruguay, WTO"
"1358",1358,"23","23.      The Chairman said that the point raised by Morocco was important and that this could be taken up in a higher body, maybe the General Council. He urged the Secretariat to raise the matter at the highest level of Administration. Recalling that the agenda item was closely related to point B of the programme of work, to be discussed in November, he proposed that the CTD agree to revert to this issue at its next meeting. He also indicated that those documents which required updating would be accordingly updated. The Committee took note of the comments made and agreed to revert to this item at its next meeting.","WTCOMTDM2.pdf","Chairman, Morocco, General, Council, Secretariat, CTD, Committee"
"1357",1357,"22","22.     The representative of Morocco required some clarification on the Central Registry of Notification (CRN) which was established by the General Council but was not mentioned in WT/COMTD/W/1/Add.1. He suggested that the Secretariat compile all the formats for notifications in a single document. In response, the Director of the Technical Cooperation and Training Division indicated that the notifications should be sent to the relevant bodies, which would in turn pass them on to the CRN. A compilation of the notification formats was circulated as an informal document at the Workshop held in May, and would be issued as a WTO document in the near future.","WTCOMTDM2.pdf","Morocco, CRN, General, Council, Secretariat, Director, Technical, Cooperation, and, Training, Division, CRN, WTO"
"1356",1356,"21","21.     Introducing document WT/COMTD/W/5, the Chairman stated that it lucidly demonstrated in an analytical manner what was required to implement the commitments undertaken by developing country Members. He said that the approach used by the Secretariat was to classify the obligations according to their nature or effect. It did not cover all agreements individually, but rather a comprehensive list of the nature of the obligations involved was given and illustrated by a number of examples. Turning to documents WT/COMTD/W/6 and its addendum, he stated that they attempted to address the needs of developing country Members by assisting them to identify which new obligations required legislative action on their part. Whereas the two documents were complementary, the matrix provided a quick overview of the requirements in each area. Finally, he added that he considered document COMTD/W/510 prepared last year to be of relevance to the debate. WT/COMTD/M/2 Page 6","WTCOMTDM2.pdf","Chairman, Members, Secretariat, Members"
"1355",1355,"20","20.     Turning to the impact of the Round on developing country Members, the Chairman indicated that a number of background documents, which complemented other documents prepared by the Secretariat, had been made available to the CTD. These documents assessed the results of the Round from both a quantitative and a qualitative perspective. He said documents that analyzed the results from a qualitative perspective discussed issues such as the rights and obligations of developing country Members under the WTO, dealing in particular on any special and differential treatment afforded to them. He was of the view that the documents should enable the CTD to make a qualitative assessment of the impact of the Round on developing country Members. He indicated that this agenda item was of relevance to the issue of participation of developing countries in the multilateral trading system, which would be discussed in the next Session of the CTD. Given their complementarity, he said delegations could have a preliminary discussion on this issue and tackle it thoroughly at the next Session.","WTCOMTDM2.pdf","Members, Chairman, Secretariat, CTD, Members, WTO, CTD, Members, CTD"
"1354",1354,"2","2.       Before turning to the agenda items, the Chairman urged delegations to use this first opportunity for putting the Committee on Trade and Development (CTD) on a path to increasing the participation of developing country Members in the multilateral trading system. He referred to two outstanding issues raised at the First Session of the CTD. He first reminded delegations about the proposal made by India concerning the terms of reference of the CTD. Since then, India had submitted a proposal in writing to him, and he had held preliminary discussions with certain delegations including India. The Chairman, however, stated that he would like to pursue further consultations with a larger number of delegations before submitting the proposal to the CTD for discussion. Second, referring to the matters raised by the representative of Argentina, speaking on behalf of the Informal Group of Developing Countries, he indicated that pursuant to his request, the document concerning the International Trade Center (ITC) had been transmitted to the Executive Director of the ITC through the Chairman of the General Council. With regard to the proposal for the setting up of a Working Group to examine possible areas of cooperation between the WTO and ITC with respect to technical cooperation activities and programmes, he stated that since the issue of cooperation between the WTO, the Bretton Woods Institutions and the United Nations and its specialized agencies was under active consideration, it would be prudent to defer discussion of the matter until the results of the broader consultations were known.","WTCOMTDM2.pdf","Chairman, Committee, on, Trade, and, Development, Members, CTD, India, India, India, Chairman, CTD, Argentina, Informal, Group, of, Developing, Countries, International, Trade, Center, ITC, Director, ITC, Chairman, General, Council, Working, Group, WTO, ITC, WTO, Bretton, Woods, Institutions, United, Nations"
"1353",1353,"19","19.     Referring to notifications under the WTO Agreement, the Chairman stated that WT/COMTD/W/1/Add.1 complemented WT/COMTD/W/1 which was presented to the CTD at its previous Session in April. He said the document contained additional information which delegations would find useful such as the formats to be followed and the bodies to which the notifications were to be addressed. He referred to the two-day Workshop on Notifications, held in Geneva on 16 and 17 May 1995, at which presentations were made by WTO officials on all the relevant Uruguay Round Agreements. This was followed by bilateral discussions between participants of the Workshop and Secretariat officials. The Secretariat prepared a summary of the presentations made at the Workshop and sent it to all Members. It was believed that the document would enhance Members' awareness, especially those who could not attend the Workshop.","WTCOMTDM2.pdf","WTO, Chairman, CTD, Geneva, WTO, Uruguay, Secretariat, Secretariat, Members, Members"
"1352",1352,"18","18.      The Chairman said that this subject always provoked an interesting debate. Delegations could revert to it at any future meeting of the CTD, particularly if constructive suggestions would be made to enhance the technical assistance programmes of the WTO. Any suggestions that could streamline the costs and strengthen cooperation with other international organizations would be very welcomed. The Committee took note of the comments made.","WTCOMTDM2.pdf","Chairman, CTD, WTO, Committee"
"1351",1351,"17","17.      The Director of the Technical Cooperation and Training Division thanked delegations for their comments and stated that the technical assistance programme of the WTO was carried out in a balanced manner. The coordination of technical assistance activities with other international organizations was of primary concern not only for the Members, but also the Secretariat and the Director-General, who was active in that area. The Secretariat was discussing the issue of coordination with a number of organizations, in particular with UNCTAD and ITC, and would make all efforts to ensure the highest level of cooperation. Concerning synergies with UNCTAD, the Secretariat was exploring ways to make use of their regional programmes to give technical assistance in the areas where the WTO had competence. Some positive results had been obtained in Latin America and discussions were being held concerning Africa, which was to receive priority in the WTO's technical assistance programmes. With respect to the lack of financial resources, he indicated that the Secretariat was ensuring whether other organizations could, in the context of their programmes, finance technical assistance programmes of the WTO. He stated that positive responses had already been received from UNCTAD and ITC. Another initiative being pursued by the WTO was to request countries to make direct contributions. Limitations with respect to human resources were also a reality, particularly when the assistance was to be provided by officials from other divisions of the WTO who had their own responsibilities to meet. He said that the Secretariat was aware, and would be doing everything within its means, to assist delegations and capitals to comply with their notification obligations within the permitted time frames. In the future, the Secretariat would be including notification-related activities in its country programmes. As regards trade policy courses, he highlighted two limitations: the number of people each class could hold and the fellowships available (currently 24). He explained that as a result of informal consultations on the special circumstances of Eastern and Central European and Central Asian countries, the Secretariat had to reduce the duration of the regular training courses in order to make space for the special courses. He was of the view that these limitations could be partially countered either through voluntary contributions by Members, or by individual countries agreeing to bear the full costs associated with the participation of additional officials from their own countries. Finally he said that there should be an attempt in the near future to see how these limitations could be removed definitively. In response to questions raised by the representative of the Philippines, the Director of the Technical Cooperation                                                                             WT/COMTD/M/2                                                                             Page 5 and Training Division indicated that a plan detailing the technical cooperation activities of the WTO for the rest of the year was in the process of being drawn up. He indicated that the decision whether or not to grant technical assistance to a country depended on factors such as the last time the country received assistance, the level of participation of the country in WTO activities, and whether non-WTO funding was available for a particular type of activity. To ensure that many countries derived benefit from WTO's technical assistance programmes, the Secretariat favoured granting assistance at a sub- regional or regional level.","WTCOMTDM2.pdf","Director, Technical, Cooperation, and, Training, Division, WTO, Members, Secretariat, Director-General, Secretariat, UNCTAD, ITC, UNCTAD, Secretariat, WTO, Latin, America, Africa, WTO, Secretariat, WTO, UNCTAD, ITC, WTO, WTO, Secretariat, Secretariat, Secretariat, Members, Philippines, Director, Training, Division, WTO, WTO, WTO, Secretariat"
"1350",1350,"16","16.      After noting that resources were scarce in contemporary times, the representative of Costa Rica stated that in some areas such as sanitary and phytosanitary measures, rules of origin and environment, coordination should be sought and strengthened so as to avoid duplication. She considered it equally important to set out in advance the priorities, such as technical assistance which would be needed by Members to comply with their notification obligations and with the changes in the Harmonized System. She proposed that document WT/COMTD/W/7 be expanded to include a section on technical cooperation activities of other international organizations in the area of environment. She was of the view that the WTO could benefit from projects drawn up by UNCTAD on matters of relevance to the WTO, including technical assistance. The representative of Trinidad and Tobago indicated that the discussion had been productive and reminded delegations to press for increased resources for technical assistance in other fora in the WTO, especially in the Committee on Budget, Finance and Administration.","WTCOMTDM2.pdf","Costa, Rica, Members, WTO, UNCTAD, WTO, Trinidad, Tobago, WTO, Committee, on, Budget, ,, Finance, and, Administration"

The representative of Norway stated that the document WT/COMTD/W/7 was a very useful document; he was of the view that it could be a valuable source of reference for institutions including governmental bodies which did not have the opportunity to closely follow the work of the WTO. He stated that his delegation attached great importance to the promotion of the WTO technical assistance activities vis-à-vis governmental bodies other than trade authorities, and that the forthcoming visit to the WTO by the Norwegian Minister of Development Cooperation to discuss the opportunities and challenges facing developing countries, especially least-developed countries, was evidence of the promotion of the work of the WTO in the area of trade and development. To enable trade authorities to maintain close contact with their development counterparts, he suggested that the Secretariat should endeavour to inform the CTD of all its technical assistance needs and any plans and strategies to meet those demands.","WTCOMTDM2.pdf","Norway, WTO, WTO, WTO, WTO, Secretariat, CTD"
"1348",1348,"14","14.     The representative of Morocco stated that given the increased participation of developing countries and countries-in-transition in the WTO, it was necessary for the organization to increase its technical assistance activities, especially considering the complexity of some of the Uruguay Round Agreements. He submitted that since the WTO would have the responsibility for ensuring the implementation of the Uruguay Round Agreements, it was imperative for it to be made the focal point and the coordinator for technical cooperation activities, even for those carried out by other international organizations. In reference to the courses offered by the Secretariat, he indicated that his delegation favoured their restructuring; that instead of focusing generally on the WTO Agreements, specific Agreements could be analyzed each time, thus making it easier for officials to come to grips with the elements in each of the covered Agreements.

The representative of Hong Kong, speaking in his capacity as Chairman of the Council for Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS), informed the Committee that contact had been made with the World Intellectual Property Organization and other relevant bodies to establish the resources they had available for technical cooperation. He stated that the TRIPS Council would have a wide-ranging debate on technical cooperation in its autumn session with a view to finding out the nature of assistance required by developing countries and how to mobilize resources to match these requirements.","WTCOMTDM2.pdf","Hong, Kong, Chairman, Committee, World, Intellectual, Property, Organization, TRIPS, Council"
"1346",1346,"12","12.      The representative of the Republic of Korea, recalling that there were around twenty-five countries in the process of acceding to the WTO, requested the Secretariat to provide technical assistance in the form of seminars for these countries. He believed such seminars would help the acceding countries, a majority of whom were developing countries, to become aware of what was expected of them. The representative of India was grateful to the Secretariat for having organized a regional seminar on anti-dumping in his country, and indicated that he would like to see similar seminars and workshops organized to analyze other topical subjects such as subsidies and countervailing measures, customs duties and other issues of a technical nature. Referring to the trade policy courses given by the Secretariat, the representative of El Salvador stated that they were useful and thorough. She further stated that, although her delegation was aware of the problems regarding funding, it would like to see the number of courses or the quotas of countries increased.","WTCOMTDM2.pdf","Republic, of, Korea, WTO, Secretariat, India, Secretariat, Secretariat, El, Salvador"
"1345",1345,"11","11.      In speaking about the need for cooperation between the WTO and other international organizations, the representative of the European Communities stated that whereas some international organizations had very specific technical cooperation programmes, others had programmes which were of relevance to the WTO's technical assistance activities. Agreeing with the representative of the Philippines, he stated that there was a need to be aware of the different activities being undertaken by other international organizations. Cooperation with these organizations should be strengthened by developing more systematic contacts, instead of working on an ad hoc basis. He further stated that the next step would be to ensure that these contacts were made on a regular basis, and that they covered the two aspects raised by the representative of Switzerland, i.e. the designing of programmes and the programming of activities.","WTCOMTDM2.pdf","WTO, European, Communities, WTO, Philippines, Switzerland"

Agreeing with some of the points raised in the Secretariat document and by the representative of the Philippines, he indicated that the aim of such cooperation should be to ensure the creation of new synergies. He submitted that there were two levels of coordination: conceptual coordination relating to the design of technical assistance programmes and coordination relating to the programming of technical cooperation activities. He enquired whether the Secretariat had any on-going concrete technical cooperation project which it was coordinating with UNCTAD.","WTCOMTDM2.pdf","Switzerland, WTO, Secretariat, Philippines, Secretariat, UNCTAD"

It was estimated that 36 least- developed countries would be fully equipped by the end of 1998. The process had so far been completed for 13 least-developed countries.

"1333",1333,"9","9.       The representative of Switzerland noted with satisfaction that the introduction of the report mentioned that the three-year plan for technical cooperation and training was a valid instrument for planning and implementation. Her delegation hoped that the Committee on Trade and Development and the Secretariat would continue to develop and improve that important instrument. However, she regretted that the report provided too few elements for the Committee to evaluate and draw lessons from the ongoing technical cooperation and training activities. It was desirable that the Secretariat, in its report, provide elements of appreciation and qualitative evaluation. Distinguishing the programmes that functioned in a satisfactory way from those that did not would enable the Committee and the Secretariat to better adjust technical assistance. It would therefore be useful if the Secretariat could prepare a complementary note to the current report for the next meeting of the Committee. Future reports should systematically contain a qualitative element of evaluation. How many activities, projects or programmes had been internally or externally evaluated? What had been the main conclusions of those evaluations? Page 8, paragraph 9 of the report provided some technical information. Many activities consisted of giving information on products of interest to developing countries or on trade flows. That information should already be available with the ITC or UNCTAD. How was coordination between those organizations ensured to avoid duplication? Was there a joint database of the three organizations on existing studies on specific products or trade flows?","WTCOMTDm19.pdf","Switzerland, Committee, on, Trade, and, Development, Secretariat, Committee, Secretariat, Committee, Secretariat, Secretariat, Committee, ITC, UNCTAD"

The Secretariat planned to cover four least- developed countries in its TPRs during 1998 which was an increase over 1997 when only one least- developed country had been dealt with in the TPR process. Three of the countries to be dealt with in 1998 would be grouped: Burkina Faso, Togo and Mali.

"1331",1331,"88","88.     The fourth point dealt with accessions. There were at present six least-developed countries in the process of accession. Of those six, Ethiopia and Laos had requested accession to the WTO since the High-Level Meeting and working parties had recently been established. In addition, Cap Verde had been granted observer status at the meeting of General Council on 19 February 1998. Bhutan had requested observer status in a communication dated 4 February 1998. In addition to the six least- developed countries already in the process of accession there were thus two others whose observer status was either decided or would be considered at the next meeting of the General Council.","WTCOMTDm19.pdf","Ethiopia, Laos, WTO, Cap, Verde, General, Council, Bhutan, General, Council"
"1330",1330,"87","87.      The third point related to market access. The Secretariat had not received any formal notification of improved market access for least-developed countries. Delegations might recall that a number of announcements had been made at the High-Level Meeting by governments that were intending to improve market access for least-developed countries. The Secretariat was waiting for those notifications.

"1329",1329,"86","86.      Second, the agencies had consulted among themselves and decided to put in place a more formal follow-up mechanism than the current inter-agency consultation process which had so far been functioning. The aim of the new mechanism was to achieve three things. One was to continue and to build on the currently functioning inter-agency coordination process. The six agencies would each be represented in an inter-agency working group which would manage the follow-up from the point of view of the six agencies. Secondly, the mechanism would create a focal point for least-developed countries, multilateral and regional intergovernmental organizations, and for other development partners of the least-developed countries to coordinate activities with a view to assisting individual least-developed countries to prepare and complete their round-table exercises. Third, the follow-up mechanism would undertake technical work. There was thus a need to establish a very small secretariat. It would not involve new resources but it would involve UNCTAD, WTO and ITC contributing to create a centralized secretariat unit which would among other things maintain databases of trade-related technical assistance provided to least-developed countries and help to develop the methodology for review and evaluation of that technical assistance. In addition, and as part of the follow-up mechanism, a focal point for least-developed countries would be established in each organization. Discussions were ongoing in the WTO Secretariat on how to best establish a functional unit that would serve as a focal point for least-developed countries. The follow-up mechanism would be available as a document as soon as it had been agreed with the other five agencies. It would also be included in the Director General's report to ministers at the May Ministerial Meeting.","WTCOMTDm19.pdf","UNCTAD, WTO, ITC, WTO, Secretariat, Director"
"1328",1328,"85","85.      The second point concerned the number of least-developed countries participating in the exercise. Of the 48 least-developed countries, 37 had so far expressed an interest in participating in the exercise by submitting completed needs assessments. The six agencies had already prepared responses for 34 of the 37 needs assessments received. There were three outstanding which had been received only very recently. The agencies were in the process of drafting responses for those three and would do so for any others that came in. The agencies would be meeting again at the beginning of June. That meeting would provide and opportunity for the six agencies to complete the first stage of the exercise of providing coordinated integrated programmes of technical assistance for the least- developed countries. Stage two of the Integrated Framework, as foreseen in the document that was adopted in October 1997, required essentially two things to be done. The first and most important was that the least-developed countries themselves, those who had received an Integrated Response from the six agencies, were expected to convene a round-table. It was generally expected that round- tables would be held in the context of the UNDP Roundtable cycle or World Bank Consultative Group meetings. So far seven least-developed countries had expressed an interest to the agencies in organizing such round-tables. Each least-developed country would be assisted in the preparation of its round-table. The agencies felt that it was important to prepare the round-tables extremely well if they were to be successful and had advised the countries concerned accordingly. The round-tables would therefore take place at the earliest this summer, most probably not until the autumn.

"1327",1327,"84","84.    Six points were worth mentioning. The first concerned the approval of the Integrated Framework by the other five agencies. As delegations might recollect, the Integrated Framework had been endorsed at the High-Level Meeting. Since then, the Secretariat had been informed that the Executive Board of the UNDP had endorsed the Integrated Framework at its session held from 19- 26 January 1998. UNCTAD's Trade and Development Board had endorsed the Integrated Framework WT/COMTD/M/19 Page 22 at its session on 16 February 1998. For ITC, which was a joint subsidiary organ of UNCTAD and WTO, the issue would be taken up for discussion at the thirty-first session of the Joint Advisory Group of the ITC foreseen for 27 April - 1 May. The Secretariat had also been informed that the World Bank and the IMF staff had informed their Executive Boards of their intention to participate as regards trade-related technical assistance.","WTCOMTDm19.pdf","Integrated, Framework, Integrated, Framework, Secretariat, Executive, Board, UNDP, Integrated, Framework, UNCTAD, Trade, and, Development, Board, ITC, UNCTAD, WTO, Joint, Advisory, Group, ITC, Secretariat, World, Bank, IMF"
"1326",1326,"83","83.     The Secretariat said that it was drafting the report for the Director General to present to Ministers at the Ministerial Meeting to be held in May 1998. The report would contain a detailed description of the work that took place in favour of the least-developed countries both at the High- Level Meeting in October of the previous year and also since then. He would indicate the main items in the Director General's report and give brief information about what these would contain.

He had conducted informal consultations in that respect but regretted that he had not been able to complete them. He therefore had to ask the new Chairman to continue those consultations until a new Chairperson for the sub-Committee had been found. It was understood that the present Chairperson of the Sub-Committee would stay until the nomination of a new one.","WTCOMTDm19.pdf","Chairman, Committee, on, Trade, and, Development, Chairman, Chairperson, Chairperson"

"1322",1322,"8","8.       The representative of Norway said that the quantity of technical assistance activities carried out was impressive as was the increase in activities in 1997 compared to the previous year. His delegation supported all five positive points mentioned by the Egyptian delegation. However, it was concerned that only one fourth of the activities had been financed through the regular budget. In an ideal world it should have been the other way around. Money did not seem to be the problem; the real strain was the capacity of Secretariat to provide technical assistance. His delegation therefore appealed to the Secretariat to be flexible and creative in using all expertise available, including, to a larger extent than currently was the practice, expertise from outside the Secretariat. Norway would be flexible in supporting meaningful activities in that respect. He questioned whether the increased quantity of technical assistance meant that a sufficient quality was maintained. It was necessary to evaluate the technical assistance given and to discuss criteria for such an evaluation. Technical assistance activities should be demand-driven and correspond to the needs of the beneficiaries; it should not be undertaken simply in order to reach a substantive number of activities.","WTCOMTDm19.pdf","Norway, Secretariat, Secretariat, Secretariat, Norway"
"1321",1321,"79","79.      The Chairman said that the Rules of Procedures of the Committee on Trade and Development stipulated that it should elect a Chairperson from among the representatives of Members. The election should take place at the first meeting of the year and should take effect at the end of the meeting. The Chairperson should hold office until the end of the first meeting of the following year. In that context, he recalled that the General Council at its meeting on 19 February noted the consensus on the nomination of Ambassador Chowdhury of Bangladesh as the next Chairman of the Committee on Trade and Development.","WTCOMTDm19.pdf","Chairman, Committee, on, Trade, and, Development, Chairperson, Members, Chairperson, General, Council, Ambassador, Chowdhury, Bangladesh, Chairman, Committee, on, Trade, and, Development"

"1319",1319,"77","77.      The Chairman said that the exchange of views had been useful. All delegations seemed interested in understanding the issue of electronic commerce. He encouraged other delegations to circulate non-papers on the issue to enable the Committee on Trade and Development to deepen its                                                                                    WT/COMTD/M/19                                                                                           Page 21 understanding. He took note of the proposal in the paper prepared by the Egyptian delegation that the Committee on Trade and Development request the Secretariat to do a number of things, including the preparation of papers. Given that the Economic Research and Analysis Division of the WTO Secretariat was currently finalising a special study on the topic of electronic commerce, which it hoped to publish by mid-April, he suggested that the Committee await the circulation of that study, which, he had been told by the Secretariat, would cover many of the elements requested by the Egyptian paper. He had also been led to believe that there was a special section in that paper covering development and social issues. It would be relevant to wait for that paper before asking the Secretariat to do any further work.","WTCOMTDm19.pdf","Chairman, Committee, on, Trade, and, Development, Committee, on, Trade, and, Development, Secretariat, Economic, Research, and, Analysis, Division, WTO, Secretariat, Committee, Secretariat, Secretariat"
"1318",1318,"76","76.      The representative of Egypt said that his delegation was conscious of the benefits that electronic commerce might provide for developing countries. The issue of participation of the private sector had been mentioned and was crucial. Electronic commerce was already taking place among the actors of the private sector. That had to be balanced with an examination of what governments ought to do in the area. The objective was not to restrict electronic commerce but to find a conducive environment that would allow electronic commerce to grow in a balanced way and contribute to development. It had been mentioned that the proposal of the delegation of the United States be treated separately. However, remarks by several delegations indicated that it would be preferable to address the issue in a coherent manner in a single forum. His delegation was flexible in that regard. His delegation was interested in addressing the issue from a development perspective. A deepened understanding was necessary. The role played by UNCTAD, WIPO, ITC and other organizations was important and would continue to be so. There was also an important role for the WTO to play. In relation to the specific proposals mentioned in the paper presented by his delegation he said that his delegation did not believe that those had to be implemented at the same time. He recognized that it would require time and looked forward to their implementation in a phased manner. It had not been the intention to duplicate work being done elsewhere. His delegation was willing to wait for the study prepared by the Secretariat to see how it could contribute to the debate. An inventory of work had been mentioned and that was in fact what his delegation had meant by the WTO Secretariat communicating with other organizations to find out what happened in other fora. It was important for the item to remain on the agenda until delegations had had time to discuss the issue and study it in capitals. If it was felt appropriate and useful, the next Chairman could initiate informal consultations after the issuance of the Secretariat paper on electronic commerce.","WTCOMTDm19.pdf","Egypt, United, States, UNCTAD, WIPO, ITC, WTO, Secretariat, WTO, Secretariat, Chairman, Secretariat"
"1317",1317,"75","75.     The representative of Mexico proposed three steps in the treatment of the issue of electronic commerce. First, the paper prepared by the WTO Secretariat should be considered. Second, once that document was available, a meeting in the Committee on Trade and Development should be organized to analyze the paper. That proposal should be seen in conjunction with the proposal by the delegation of Egypt. The WTO could also prepare a factual document on where work was being carried out on electronic commerce. It was common knowledge that UNCTAD, OECD and APEC had carried out work in that respect but it was important not to forget the role played by the private sector. Third, a guideline for the WTO ministerial meeting could be prepared for ministers to be able to determine a way to channel the analysis of the issue. Trade facilitation had three clear faces: first an exploration at the global level, second, the organization at the regional, multilateral and bilateral level, and third, private initiatives. The discussion of electronic commerce could focus on and have those same perspectives. The WTO had to face fully the question of electronic commerce and create the necessary multilateral rules.","WTCOMTDm19.pdf","Mexico, WTO, Secretariat, Committee, on, Trade, and, Development, Egypt, WTO, UNCTAD, OECD, APEC, WTO, WTO"
"1316",1316,"74","74.     The representative of Norway said that the Egyptian paper was timely, particularly since his government had different ministries focusing on the issue. Electronic commerce was not the future, it was currently taking place and at a rapidly increasing pace. At the same time, the legal framework relating to electronic commerce was unclear. There was need for increased understanding and possibly for some definitions. The need to maintain momentum should therefore not be underestimated. His delegation wished to take part in any future consultations.","WTCOMTDm19.pdf","Norway"
"1315",1315,"73","73.     The representative of Peru said that the current discussion was opportune since it corresponded to the ever greater interest in having analytical studies and exchange of information to better understand the implications of electronic commerce from the point of view of modalities of trade as well as legal coverage. His delegation supported the proposal made by the delegation of WT/COMTD/M/19 Page 20 Egypt to ask the WTO to draw up a factual document including all aspects of the WTO which might be of interest for electronic trade, among others the GATS, intellectual property and customs valuation. The issue of electronic commerce should be kept on the agenda of the Committee on Trade and Development as it would allow Members to deal with the issue from the development perspective. His delegation was willing to participate in informal consultations.","WTCOMTDm19.pdf","Peru, Egypt, WTO, WTO, GATS, Committee, on, Trade, and, Development, Members"
"1314",1314,"72","72.     The representative of Hong Kong, China said that her delegation would appreciate an in- depth discussion in relation to the implications of electronic commerce on developing economies. Her delegation shared the sentiments that there was a need to address the issue in the broader context of the WTO. She looked forward to any relevant discussion on the topic and said that her delegation would be willing to participate actively.","WTCOMTDm19.pdf","Hong, Kong, China, WTO"
"1313",1313,"71","71.      The representative of Korea said that the implications of electronic commerce on the multilateral trading system were overarching. Issues such as market access, intellectual property rights, customs valuation and Article XX exceptions had to be considered. It was therefore premature to decide where and how to proceed with the discussion on electronic commerce. He supported the suggestion to await the Secretariat paper and was willing to participate in any informal discussion.","WTCOMTDm19.pdf","Korea, Secretariat"
"1312",1312,"70","70.      The representative of Japan said that electronic commerce would contribute to the efficiency of economic activities and had the potential to promote a balanced development of the global economy. While electronic commerce was promoted primarily by private sector initiatives, it was necessary to coordinate and develop the appropriate environment and establish new global rules. His delegation welcomed discussions on electronic commerce in the framework of the WTO. The Government of Japan encouraged ongoing tests by the private sector with respect to electronic commerce. His Government was prepared to make the results of those tests available to carry forward the international discussions on electronic commerce in the WTO. There were currently no customs duties on electronic commerce in Japan and it was desirable for other Members to keep a similar practice to promote electronic commerce. Concrete discussions on customs duties had to be held considering the deliberations in other international fora. As the proposal in the WTO was expected to lead to a legally binding agreement with multilateral disciplines it was important for the discussion and examination to clarify definitions legally.","WTCOMTDm19.pdf","Japan, WTO, Japan, WTO, Japan, Members, WTO"
"1311",1311,"7","7.       The representative of the European Communities said that technical assistance was an area in which it was important to avoid overlap with other organizations. Her delegation welcomed the great increase in technical assistance activities and said that technical assistance should remain demand- driven. Ear-marking a fund for activities benefitting the least-developed countries should not be considered contradictory to the principle of demand-driven technical assistance. Her delegation was of the understanding that it had been agreed that the Integrated Programme for Africa be subsumed into the Integrated Framework for Trade-Related Technical Assistance, including for Human and Institutional Capacity-Building, to Support Least-Developed Countries in Their Trade and Trade- Related Activities but did not find any reference to that effect in the report. The Committee on Trade and Development should work towards developing ways to monitor and evaluate technical assistance activities.

The representative of Canada appreciated the effort of the Egyptian delegation in putting forward the interests of developing countries with regard to electronic commerce and agreed on the importance of looking at how electronic commerce could contribute to trade growth and development. There was ongoing work in a number of fora that might partly achieve some of the suggestions in the paper presented by the Egyptian delegation. The WTO paper was one such example. The first step in any new work by the WTO Secretariat would be an inventory of existing work undertaken: by the Development Bureau of the ITU, especially in the context of the World Telecommunications Development Conference that would take place in Malta at the end of March; by the UNCTAD trade point programme which was part of the trade efficiency initiative launched by UNCTAD VIII; by the UNCTAD partners for the development programme launched in October 1997 that had as one of its two main themes a global electronic trade partnership; by UNCTAD IX, Midrand, which recommended that UNCTAD should follow up the results of the UN international symposium of trade efficiency and, in close cooperation with ITU, assess the practical trade and development implications of the emerging global information infrastructure and identify relevant avenues for action in this area; and finally by the Global Knowledge 1997, held in Toronto sponsored by the Government of Canada and the World Bank. An inventory should lay the ground for any further work.","WTCOMTDm19.pdf","Canada, WTO, WTO, Secretariat, Development, Bureau, ITU, World, Telecommunications, Development, Conference, Malta, UNCTAD, UNCTAD, UNCTAD, UNCTAD, Midrand, UNCTAD, UN, ITU, Toronto, Government, of, Canada, World, Bank"
"1309",1309,"68","68.     The representative of Myanmar, speaking on behalf of ASEAN, said that, at the meeting of the General Council of 19 February 1998, ASEAN had indicated the interest of its member delegations to broaden the understanding of electronic commerce, in particular its economic, trade and                                                                                    WT/COMTD/M/19                                                                                           Page 19 social implications. The Egyptian paper provided useful ideas in terms of its objectives and outlined specific proposals for future activities. His delegation saw merit in further looking into those aspects in the WTO. The proposals were relevant and would contribute to meeting the objectives of enhancing the understanding of electronic commerce. There was a particular need to tap the expertise of other international organizations, such as UNCTAD.","WTCOMTDm19.pdf","Myanmar, ASEAN, General, Council, ASEAN, WTO, UNCTAD"
"1308",1308,"67","67.      The representative of New Zealand said that the Egyptian paper was useful and timely in that it set out some of the specific development issues involved in electronic commerce: the weaknesses in telecommunication infrastructure in developing countries and the problems in achieving broad-based access for users. The WTO had a role to play in enhancing international cooperation in the area of electronic commerce and the guiding principles should be coherence, transparency, coordination and avoiding duplication. He noted that the specific aspects of electronic commerce already had been considered by various WTO groups, most recently by the General Council. That raised the question of whether the Committee on Trade and Development should be taking the lead on some of the more general issues identified in the paper presented by the Egyptian delegation. Before progressing much further, his delegation believed that it would be useful to identify work that had been done to date and to establish a coordinated approach for future WTO activity. That appeared to be the aim of the first specific proposal in Egypt's paper, a proposal which his delegation supported. It would also be useful to provide WTO Members with more information on the activities of other international organizations as illustrated by the delegation of Pakistan. After having considered the forthcoming paper of the Secretariat, the Committee on Trade and Development would be better placed to consider the second, fourth and fifth proposal of Egypt's paper, relating specifically to the needs of developing countries such as a special session of the Committee on Trade and Development and a seminar with UNCTAD and ITC. His delegation agreed with the delegation of the European Communities in that it would be premature to begin a programme of work without due consideration of the Secretariat's paper. The WTO as a whole should look further into the issue before arranging joint seminars with other organizations. The proposal made by the delegation of the United States at the General Council was interesting and practical. The use of electronic commerce raised important international trade policy and trade facilitation considerations and could offer significant benefits to a wide range of countries. His delegation therefore looked forward to participating actively in future discussions in the General Council on that proposal.","WTCOMTDm19.pdf","New, Zealand, WTO, WTO, General, Council, Committee, on, Trade, and, Development, WTO, Egypt, WTO, Members, Pakistan, Secretariat, Committee, on, Trade, and, Development, Egypt, Committee, on, Trade, and, Development, UNCTAD, ITC, Secretariat, WTO, United, States, General, Council, General, Council"

"1306",1306,"65","65.     The representative of Pakistan believed that it was useful for Members to exchange views on developments in the area of electronic commerce. Those developments appeared to take place at rapid pace, not only in the area of technological development but also in the area of regulation. The momentum had been advanced by countries that had advantages in information technology and which were already witnessing growth in the area of electronic commerce. In July 1997, the United States WT/COMTD/M/19 Page 18 Government had made an announcement on a framework for global electronic commerce which was followed by a ministerial declaration of the European Communities on global information networks. In addition to those framework proposals, many aspects of electronic commerce were being addressed in a number of fora: taxation matters in the OECD, electronic payment systems in the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, uniform commercial code in the International Chamber of Commerce, some aspects of intellectual property protection in WIPO, domain names in ITU, privacy and security matters in the OECD and APEC, access to infrastructure, telecommunication and issues of inter-operability in ITU, OECD and WTO, and technical standards in OECD, ISO and ITU. It seemed obvious that work in all those fora needed to be monitored. Another aspect that required examination was the issue of implications for developing countries: would unrestricted, unregulated electronic commerce provide increased market access to enterprises in developing countries; how would developing country enterprises be fairing, especially with regard to their competitive ability in areas where electronic commerce was carried out; what would the infrastructural implications be; what would be the effect on other modes of supply such as commercial presence and the movement of natural persons; what impact could electronic commerce have on customs revenue. The importance of analysing and monitoring developments was obvious. UNCTAD was doing some work in the area as was the WTO Research Division. Once such papers had been studied, delegations might be in a better position to assess implications and decide on how to proceed with work on the issue.","WTCOMTDm19.pdf","Pakistan, Members, United, States, OECD, Basel, Committee, on, Banking, Supervision, International, Chamber, of, Commerce, WIPO, ITU, OECD, APEC, ITU, OECD, WTO, OECD, ISO, ITU, UNCTAD, WTO, Research, Division"
"1305",1305,"64","64.      The representative of European Communities said that given the fact that electronic commerce covered international trade, the WTO should play a significant role in providing a global predictable framework for its development. Aspects of electronic commerce were relevant under a number of Agreements in the WTO; GATS, the Agreement on Basic Telecommunications, the Agreement on Government Procurement, the Agreement on TRIPS as well as the ITA, including the work currently undertaken under the ITA II. She also recalled the initiative by the Government of the United States on avoiding import duties on electronic transmissions. Her delegation welcomed the initiative to address issues of electronic commerce in the WTO. The initiative was useful in launching the discussion on one of the many issues at stake. Further discussions over the next months were necessary to address other trade-related aspects such as intellectual property rights, government procurement, trade facilitation and to provide a general framework for the development of electronic commerce. It was the view of her delegation that the GATS would have to play a major role in further discussions since electronic transmissions had to be characterized as services. The debate was at an early stage. Many trading partners were only starting to address electronic commerce as a trade issue. The understanding of the issue had to be deepened. It was therefore a positive development that the Committee on Trade and Development at the initial stage also focused on electronic commerce. Not being a technical Committee, Members would benefit from exchanging experiences, listening to each other, discussing overall objectives, concerns and opportunities from the particular perspective of developing countries. However, it would be too early to elaborate a programme of work for the Committee on Trade and Development. The WTO had to put together all elements relevant to the new area of electronic commerce and identify one forum where energy and resources could be concentrated. Until then it was good to explore all aspects of electronic commerce in the Committee on Trade and Development but it was too early to adopt an agenda. The ambition as to joint action should currently be limited as it was still unclear what type of action the WTO as a whole should take with respect to electronic commerce.","WTCOMTDm19.pdf","European, Communities, WTO, WTO, ITA, United, States, WTO, Committee, on, Trade, and, Development, Committee, Members, Committee, on, Trade, and, Development, WTO, Committee, on, Trade, and, Development, WTO"
"1304",1304,"63","63.     The representative of India said that his delegation recognized the positive effects electronic commerce could have on growth. As was pointed out in the paper prepared by the delegation of Egypt, the potential of electronic commerce had captured the attention of governments, businesses and consumers alike. The developments in the area would have a substantial impact on growth and development and fundamental implications on the way in which business transactions and trade were carried out. The detail of the paper showed that electronic commerce was a complex issue. There was no accepted definition of what electronic commerce covered. There were aspects of electronic commerce that touched on existing WTO provisions and other aspects which would require further study, especially regarding benefits for developing countries. Issues that had to be examined included; the treatment of intellectual property protection, the movement of natural persons in the form of service providers involved in electronic trade, regulatory regimes, and the administration of border taxes and controls. His delegation therefore supported the proposal made by the delegation of Egypt to have a joint seminar organised with UNCTAD for the impact of electronic commerce on developing countries to be appropriately assessed. UNCTAD could be requested to invite relevant intergovernmental organizations to such a seminar. His delegation looked forward to the paper on electronic commerce prepared by the Research Division of the WTO Secretariat and hoped that that paper would address the specific issues raised in the working paper submitted by the delegation of Egypt. His delegation was willing to participate in informal consultations on the matter.","WTCOMTDm19.pdf","India, Egypt, WTO, Egypt, UNCTAD, UNCTAD, WTO, Secretariat, Egypt"
"1303",1303,"62","62.     Her delegation generally supported the idea of increased exchange of information. That would be demonstrated during the WTO Trade Facilitation Seminar in which companies from the United States and other countries would participate. Increased information should also result from the study on Electronic Commerce that the WTO's Research Division would issue by mid-March. Before asking the Secretariat to undertake additional work, her delegation believed that it made sense to ask the Chairman of the General Council to undertake informal consultations on electronic commerce in the near future. Her delegation also welcomed informal discussions on developing country concerns. She wished to point out that there was a distinction between the proposal of the United States for duty- free electronic transmissions and what her delegation believed that the delegation of Egypt was addressing. The discussion initiated by the delegation of Egypt should continue as it was important to cover all issues. The proposal of the United States before the General Council was a first step that                                                                                    WT/COMTD/M/19                                                                                           Page 17 would help facilitate that discussion. There was no need to mesh the two proposals. The General Council was the appropriate body to continue the discussions on her delegation's proposal.","WTCOMTDm19.pdf","WTO, United, States, Electronic, Commerce, WTO, Research, Division, Secretariat, Chairman, General, Council, United, States, Egypt, Egypt, United, States, General, Council, General, Council"
"1302",1302,"61","61.      The representative of United States said her delegation was impressed by the thoroughness, thoughtfulness and studied approach of the paper. It was a valuable contribution to the emerging discussion on electronic commerce. She hoped that all delegations also studied the proposal put forward by Ambassador Hayes to the General Council on 19 February. The core conclusion of the paper presented by the delegation of Egypt was the vital need for infrastructural development in developing countries and the dilemma as to where financing would come from. Her delegation's answer was that such infrastructure needs should be met by private sector investments, domestic and foreign. It had been her delegation's experience that investment was attracted to hospitable environments where competition led to growth and government rules were minimal. A special fund had been created in order to finance the linking of all schools in the United States, a task that had been 80 per cent completed. Developing countries could do the same. Egypt's paper noted that few funds would be available from international financial institutions. With the changes underway in international telephone accounting rates the revenues of traditional telephone monopolies were sure to decline in the coming years. The best source of future investment would therefore be the private sector. Developing countries themselves would decide whether or not they would be connected electronically and benefit from electronic commerce. Some countries in the developing world had already began a process and were doing well. Her delegation would encourage Egypt and other developing countries that had not yet done so to join the Information Technology Agreement and to make commitments on basic telecommunications. It was also important to support the proposal for a duty-free environment for electronic transmissions. Those gestures would go a long way to ensure private sector investment in response to the openness of the regimes. Egypt and other developing countries should join in the call for the private sector to lead in fostering the growth of electronic commerce through self-regulatory codes of practice.","WTCOMTDm19.pdf","United, States, Ambassador, Hayes, General, Council, Egypt, United, States, Egypt, Egypt, Information, Technology, Agreement, Egypt"

If electronic commerce were to become of significant importance, as his delegation expected, it had to be ensured that the infrastructure in developing countries, both human and physical, was capable of supporting its development. His delegation approached the issue with an open mind and in a flexible manner and looked forward to constructive discussions on that important issue. Finally, he requested that the proposals he had made should be put forward in informal consultations to be held by the next chairman. His delegation did not push for hasty results but wished to see the issue move forward.","WTCOMTDm19.pdf","chairman"
"1300",1300,"6","6.       Third, his delegation found the Briefing Sessions referred to under subsection 6 on page 7 useful and believed that with little effort from the Secretariat they could be extended to benefit more developing country delegations. Briefing sessions should be extended to cover more WTO Agreements and should be held for developing country missions, newcomers to the WTO and for junior WTO staff members. Fourth, with respect to information technology his delegation proposed that a training session for Geneva-based diplomats be organized to familiarize them with information technology activities of the WTO and how those could be used effectively by developing countries. Sub-section 9 on page 8 of the report dealt with technical information provided by the WTO Secretariat. His delegation was not aware of the details of that kind of activity and would therefore appreciate it if the Secretariat could prepare a factual paper on that kind of assistance. Such a paper should make capitals aware of the service and utilize it more effectively. Finally, his delegation had always believed that the Integrated Technical Assistance Programme for Africa should be evaluated more carefully. He asked if an evaluation paper could be prepared by the Secretariat and if such a paper would be linked to the report currently being prepared by the Secretariat for the Ministerial Conference. He further asked what the relation was between activities undertaken as a result of the High-Level Meeting on Integrated Initiatives for Least-Developed Countries' Trade Development and activities of the Integrated Technical Assistance Programme for Africa.","WTCOMTDm19.pdf","Secretariat, WTO, WTO, WTO, WTO, WTO, Secretariat, Secretariat, Integrated, Technical, Assistance, Programme, Africa, Secretariat, Secretariat, Integrated, Technical, Assistance, Programme, Africa"

In conclusion, a number of specific proposals were made in the paper, these were:         -       to request the WTO Secretariat to prepare a factual paper on WTO provisions and                 activities that were most relevant to electronic commerce;         -       to request the WTO Secretariat to prepare an analytical paper on how to enhance the                 participation of developing countries in electronic commerce and the use of                 information technology in the integration of developing countries in the MTS.

"1298",1298,"58","58.     The paper briefly addressed a few related activities in the WTO and in other international organizations. His delegation wished to stress three points:         -       as far as the WTO was concerned, stronger organic links should be established among                 the areas of WTO competence which were of immediate relevance to discussions on                 electronic commerce;         -       the necessity for cooperation among international organizations dealing with issues                 related to electronic commerce which was a direct result of its inter-sectoral nature;         -       how to integrate information technology in ongoing trade-related activities and                 programmes.","WTCOMTDm19.pdf","WTO, WTO, WTO"
"1297",1297,"57","57.      He said that the paper enumerated a number of policy areas related to electronic commerce which were usually classified into three broad groups: financial, legal and access issues. However, a discussion should not concentrate unduly on a very detailed consideration of issues that might appear central today but which were likely to disappear or become replaced by others in a constantly evolving environment. Some of the policy issues did not fall within the purview of the WTO and others were addressed by a number of international organizations. His delegation felt that it would be useful for WTO Members to become aware of the latest developments in policy areas and address the role of the WTO, if any, in areas where it might make a useful contribution.","WTCOMTDm19.pdf","WTO, WTO, Members, WTO"
"1296",1296,"56","56.     He went on to say that one of the challenges that developing countries in particular faced in relation to electronic commerce was how to create a conducive policy environment that would maximize the benefits of electronic commerce without compromising legitimate public policy objectives. Enhancing developing countries' interest for and participation in electronic commerce would require concerted efforts, at the policy, the analytical and the technical level. It would be necessary to establish a conceptual and policy platform reflecting the interests and specificities of developing countries in a global framework for electronic commerce. A number of developed                                                                                    WT/COMTD/M/19                                                                                           Page 15 countries had recently completed policy papers on how to establish a global framework for electronic commerce. These papers contained very little about the role of developing countries in designing, establishing and implementing such a framework. Those major trading partners had a global responsibility and should consider the role that they should play to enable developing countries to benefit from this important area and help enhance their participation in international trade in goods and services including through electronic commerce. Developing countries would require assistance to help them put their information on the Internet. It was important to gain knowledge about how much of the trade related information on the Internet originated from developing countries. That issue should be monitored continuously and could be considered as one of the factors that could contribute to the evaluation of the progress of enhancing the role of developing countries in electronic commerce. Developing countries would also require assistance in establishing the regulatory framework that would be conducive to the development of the information society and in raising awareness in the public and the private sectors of the significance of electronic commerce. International cooperation would be necessary in facilitating access to information and to the global information infrastructure, in promoting the transfer of information technology, in the participation of developing countries in research and development activities and related areas as well as in measures to foster dialogue and partnerships between developing and developed countries, both governmental and private, in the area of electronic commerce.","WTCOMTDm19.pdf",""
"1295",1295,"55","55.      He continued by stating that the paper addressed briefly the technological developments and liberalization efforts that were related to electronic commerce and the challenges facing developing countries and African countries in particular in terms of their weakness in telecommunication and information infrastructure as well as elements of the financial requirements in the area. It also addressed the development and impact of the Internet as a global tool for collecting, disseminating and exchanging information. Electronic commerce would extend the scope of what might be considered tradable. Any good or service that might be provided in digital form could probably be traded electronically within and across borders. There was a need to identify areas and sectors where electronic commerce was expected to gain importance. It would also be of vital importance to strengthen the capacity of developing countries to participate in electronic trade in these and in other sectors especially since the impact of electronic commerce might be significant and relatively fast. The paper gave an indication of the kind of difficulties that firms in developing countries were facing and it referred to some of the difficulties encountered by firms in developed countries in dealing with electronic commerce.","WTCOMTDm19.pdf",""
"1294",1294,"54","54.      It was the conviction of his delegation that information technology in general and electronic commerce in particular could be instrumental in enhancing the participation of developing countries in the MTS if the right approach was followed. There was a real fear that if the necessary steps were not taken that mode of trade might remain beyond the reach of many developing countries. The current trade of developing countries, particularly products that might be transmitted digitally, could be diverted if they did not participate actively in electronic commerce as early as possible in the process. Furthermore, the current gap between developed and developing countries might widen as a result of rapid change if concerted action is not taken. The need to narrow the gap between the north and the south had been recognized by all. Narrowing that gap was both important and urgent and would be beneficial to both developed and developing countries alike.","WTCOMTDm19.pdf","MTS"
"1293",1293,"53","53.     The representative of Egypt said that his delegation might make minor changes to the paper in light of comments made during the meeting. The current discussion should only be seen as the WT/COMTD/M/19 Page 14 initiation of a process. Delegations would therefore have time to study the issue more in detail in the future. The potential of electronic commerce had captured the attention of governments, businesses and consumers alike. The developments in the area would have a substantial impact on growth and development. They would also have fundamental implications on the way in which business transactions and trade were carried out. His delegation had identified four objectives for addressing the issue:         (i)     to deepen the understanding of electronic commerce and deal with it in a coherent and                 balanced manner, focusing on the use of electronic commerce in integrating                 developing countries into the Multilateral Trading System (MTS);         (ii)    to examine the role of the WTO in bridging the information gap in the area of trade                 between developed and developing countries;         (iii)   to examine how electronic commerce and recent proposals on a possible global                 framework for electronic commerce would affect the supply and demand of goods                 and services, the market structure, labour markets and competition,         (iv)    to share experience on issues related to electronic commerce.","WTCOMTDm19.pdf","Egypt, WTO"
"1292",1292,"52","52.      The Chairman said that, at the Committee's last meeting, the representative of Egypt had raised the issue of electronic commerce in goods and services and requested that it be put on today's Agenda. He had also said that his delegation intended to present an informal paper to the Committee, which had since been circulated in document WT/COMTD/W/38. In addition to an analysis of the various issues involved, the paper contained a number of specific proposals for future activities for consideration by the Committee on Trade and Development and requested a number of papers and activities of the Secretariat. In that context he recalled that the Economic Research and Analysis Division of the WTO Secretariat was preparing a special study on electronic commerce which it hoped to publish in April.","WTCOMTDm19.pdf","Chairman, Committee, Egypt, Committee, Committee, on, Trade, and, Development, Secretariat, Economic, Research, and, Analysis, Division, WTO, Secretariat"

"1290",1290,"50","50.     The Chairman noted that there were different perceptions of the issues of special and differential provisions. Several delegations had mentioned the importance of technical assistance. Many delegations had seen the need for further work on the matter in the Committee on Trade and Development, pursuant to its mandate. The need for horizontal work between bodies of the WTO Secretariat dealing with specific Agreements had been expressed. It had been suggested that the new Chairman of the Committee on Trade and Development should conduct informal consultations on the most useful orientation the Committee's discussions on the issue. Consensus was emerging in the WTO that implementation would be one of the Agenda items of the Ministerial Meeting in 1998. The work of the Committee on Trade and Development could then provide an additional insight to the discussions that might arise in the General Council.","WTCOMTDm19.pdf","Chairman, Committee, on, Trade, and, Development, WTO, Secretariat, Chairman, Committee, on, Trade, and, Development, Committee, WTO, Committee, on, Trade, and, Development, General, Council"
"1289",1289,"5","5.       The representative of Egypt said that his delegation had found five positive elements in the report: the increase in the level of technical assistance activities; the increase in extra budgetary resources; the increase in Africa's share in the technical assistance given; the increased coverage of various WTO Agreements and activities; and the increase in activities in relation to the High-Level Meeting on Integrated Initiatives for Least-Developed Countries' Trade Development. Those five elements constituted a positive trend which he hoped would continue. He had a number of specific remarks in relation to the report. First, his delegation doubted that technical assistance was best evaluated by way of number of activities carried out. Some activities were minor while others were major. His delegation looked forward to further improvements in reporting in order to enable delegations to evaluate better the technical assistance provided. Second, his delegation had found that a large percentage of the technical assistance provided had been given through seminars. These were useful to increase initial awareness but the focus should in the future be shifted to practical advice and technical assistance missions in, for example, such areas as assistance in the preparation of notifications, advice in relation to laws and legislation, and advice in respect to the implementation of various WTO Agreements.","WTCOMTDm19.pdf","Egypt, Africa, WTO, WTO"
"1288",1288,"49","49.     The representative of Pakistan said that his delegation wished to further consider the updated document that his delegation had asked for at the previous meeting of the Committee on Trade and Development. There were certain areas in which the implementation should be looked at closely. He therefore asked that the item be kept on the Committee's agenda. Informal consultations might be helpful. He suggested that specific special and differential provisions of individual Agreements be measured by how far they had reached their fundamental objectives of enabling developing countries to cope with the changed environment following the implementation of those Agreements. That type of analysis could give an insight into how useful the special and differential provisions were and whether they could be strengthened and improved upon in future Agreements to be negotiated. The ultimate purpose of the exercise was to enable developing countries to compete in an equitable manner in a globalizing economic environment.","WTCOMTDm19.pdf","Pakistan, Committee, on, Trade, and, Development, Committee"

"1286",1286,"47","47.     The representative of Cuba said that special and differential provisions were of capital interest to developing countries and he associated his delegation with what had been said by the representatives of India, Egypt and Morocco. Consultations should be held to find ways to improve the implementation of special and differential provisions.","WTCOMTDm19.pdf","Cuba, India, Egypt, Morocco"
"1285",1285,"46","46.      The representative of Australia particularly welcomed the transparency of the Secretariat paper in setting out the provisions in all of the WTO Agreements and how they had been used. There were some necessary limitations to the paper as it was based on what had been notified. There were areas in which use or reliance on special and differential provisions did not need to be notified. There were also vast areas of technical assistance covered either bilaterally or by international organizations which had been left out of the document. Her delegation had always considered the relationship between rules, standards and protection as being a complicated one. Being a small player, her government had looked to the rules-based system to provide a certain security and to agreements, such as the SPS, to prevent measures from being used for disguised protectionism. Important issues regarding transparency and notifications had been raised. Her delegation would carefully consider the                                                                                      WT/COMTD/M/19                                                                                             Page 13 specific proposals made and hoped that a further discussion would be held on the role of special and differential provisions in assisting developing countries to gain benefits from their participation in the WTO.","WTCOMTDm19.pdf","Australia, Secretariat, WTO, SPS, WTO"
"1284",1284,"45","45.      The representative of Myanmar, speaking on behalf of ASEAN, said that ASEAN considered special and differential treatment an important principle as it allowed developing countries to contribute to and meaningfully participate in the WTO. Developing countries had increasingly been contributing in assuming greater obligations with respect to various Agreements of the WTO. Additionally, it should be recognized that developing countries were undertaking voluntary autonomous liberalisation. On the other hand, developing countries had been enabled a certain flexibility in relation to particular obligations. The special and differential provisions allowed developing countries to be part of the WTO and his delegation was therefore concerned both about ideas that would erode the special and differential provisions and about deficiencies in the application of special and differential provisions in some of the Agreements. The idea presented by the representative of India could usefully be pursued to further develop and meaningfully operationalize the special and differential provisions.","WTCOMTDm19.pdf","Myanmar, ASEAN, ASEAN, WTO, WTO, WTO, India"
"1283",1283,"44","44.      The representative of Hong Kong, China said that just as Members could self-select the status of developing country or economy, so they could self-select whether or not to take advantage of individual special and differential treatment provisions in particular agreements. It should therefore not be assumed that a Member that had developing status automatically took advantage of all preferential provisions at its disposal. For example, in the case of Hong Kong, China, very sparing use of such preferential provisions had been made. He could only think of one provision from which advantage had been drawn. However, that had in practical terms been more than offset by the discrimination to which exports from Hong Kong, China had been subject over many years as a result of its developing country status, particularly in relation to trade in textiles and clothing. Members with developing status should not think of that status as a one-way street, nor should it be thought of in terms of a balance sheet of advantages and liabilities under particular agreements. There were more intangible factors which had to be taken into account. While the Secretariat paper was a useful reference document, it by no means told the entire story, especially given the caveats relating to the information which was available or not available with respect to implementation. His delegation was interested in participating in informal consultations.","WTCOMTDm19.pdf","Hong, Kong, China, Members, Member, Hong, Kong, China, Hong, Kong, China, Members, Secretariat"
"1282",1282,"43","43.     The representative of Canada said that her delegation wished to see the Committee taking note of the document. Her delegation continued to support efforts to provide technical assistance to developing countries, in particular to least-developed countries, to help them integrate into the multilateral trading. Her delegation took the occasion to raise the issue of notifications of regional trade agreements. The most recent list from the Secretariat which was contained in document WT/COMTD/W/27/Rev.1 suggested that some agreements or changes to them had not been notified. Paragraph 4 of the Enabling Clause required that any contracting party taking action to introduce an arrangement pursuant to the Enabling Clause or subsequently taking action to modify or withdraw the differential and more favourable treatment so provided shall notify the CONTRACTING PARTIES and furnish them with all the information they may deem appropriate relating to such action. Those requirements should be duly implemented in a transparent way by all Members. Her delegation considered the relevant information to include a copy of the agreement, additional annexes describing the preferential treatment granted and basic trade statistics.","WTCOMTDm19.pdf","Canada, Committee, Secretariat, Members"
"1281",1281,"42","42.      The representative of United States said that his delegation's reaction to the document was similar to that of the European Communities. The document was a balanced update on the process, not only of the fulfilment of developed country obligations in relation to special and differential provisions but also of the integration of developing countries into the multilateral trading system. The document was helpful in pointing out the deficiencies on both sides. Two previous speakers had touched on the issue of what more work could be done in the area. The representatives of Egypt and India had approached the issue differently. The approach of the representative of Egypt was a more generic one, including an informal discussion on the whole issue of special and differential provisions. The representative of India had made specific proposals. He felt the suggestion by the Indian representative to have the Secretariat carry out work in relation to the next round of negotiations in services would lead to duplication of work and place an additional burden on the Secretariat. The requirements for preparing for the next round of service negotiations had specific elements dealing with developing countries. Those were the requirements that had to be fulfilled in that process. The issue had to be addressed in a substantive way. He found more appropriate the proposal made by the representative of Egypt to discuss informally in the Committee on Trade and Development what the issues might be, taking all of the agreements into account.

He underlined the need for developed countries to live up to their promise of providing technical assistance to developing countries to meet the standards, especially since SPS and TBT requirements were being made more stringent in many developed countries. He hoped that it would be possible for developing countries to be assisted as provided for in the special provisions of the above mentioned agreements. His delegation agreed with the statement made by the representative of Bangladesh.","WTCOMTDm19.pdf","Uganda, SPS, TBT, SPS, Bangladesh"

The representative of Japan said he wished the document to be brought the attention of other appropriate bodies of the WTO such as the Trade Policy Review Body and accession working parties where discussions sometimes occurred on whether a country was to be considered a developing country or not.

"1278",1278,"4","4.      With regard to the WTO Trade Policy Courses referred to on page 14 of the report, he suggested that one slot should be ear-marked for each developing country. That should be possible WT/COMTD/M/19 Page 2 given that the number of courses had increased and that they were conducted in the three official WTO languages. The matter should be discussed in the Committee on Trade and Development for a suitable input to be given to the Budget Committee. Referring to section III, his delegation presumed that the activities relating to ""Investment"", as mentioned on page 4, had been undertaken in response to specific requests by developing country members. Such activities should be without prejudice to the work being done in the Working Group on the Relationship between Trade and Investment and the eventual outcome of that Group's work.","WTCOMTDm19.pdf","WTO, WTO, Committee, on, Trade, and, Development, Budget, Committee, III, Working, Group, Trade, and, Investment, Group"
"1277",1277,"39","39.     The representative of Bangladesh said that special and differential treatment was an important aspect of the multilateral trading system. It was therefore both an obligation and a responsibility of the Secretariat to reflect on achievements with respect to the implementation of special and differential provisions. His delegation understood that it might not always be possible to respond to preambular texts. Some of those special and differential provisions were for Members to implement autonomously in bilateral relations. The WTO was responsible for monitoring the multilateral trading system and should have the capacity and knowledge to brief Members as to the actual state of implementation of special and differential provisions.","WTCOMTDm19.pdf","Bangladesh, Secretariat, Members, WTO, Members"
"1276",1276,"38","38.      The representative of European Communities said that her delegation had been satisfied with the previous version of the document as it pointed to the conclusion that the level of implementation of the special and differential provisions was high, both on the part of developing countries and on the part of developed Members. The deepened analysis in the revised version had confirmed the earlier                                                                                    WT/COMTD/M/19                                                                                           Page 11 conclusion. Various examples of the high level of implementation could be found in the document, even in areas of particular relevance to developing countries. For example, the part on the Agreement on Agriculture began with a positive note concerning tropical agricultural products. Another good example was found under the section on the Agreement on Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures (SPS) where it was mentioned that some equivalence agreements had been concluded. Even in relation to the Agreement on Technical Barriers to Trade which had been mentioned as a not particularly good sector it had been agreed that technical assistance should be provided. Her delegation encouraged developing countries to make full use of the flexibility built into the system with the aim of fully integrating into the world economy. Her delegation was of the opinion that the document was a good one and hoped that the Committee on Trade and Development could take note of the document as it was. It could constitute the agreed basis of reference for future work.","WTCOMTDm19.pdf","Members, SPS, Committee, on, Trade, and, Development"
"1275",1275,"37","37.      The representative of Morocco said that the effort to improve the rules and regulations in favour of developing countries in the WTO Agreements should be maintained. Those rules and regulations constituted an integral part of the rights and obligations of the WTO Agreements. They should therefore be fully implemented just as obligations in other Agreements. The Committee on Trade and Development and the Secretariat should proceed to an analysis of the provisions and their implementation. That should be done in coordination with other implementing WTO bodies so as to contribute to the improvement of the concept of special and differential treatment. Special and differential treatment tried to achieve a balance of rights and obligations among Members at different levels of economic development. It was common knowledge that some provisions were difficult to operationalize whereas others which took the form of declarations were not accompanied by any concrete measures. His delegation supported the proposal made by the representative of Egypt that informal consultations should be carried out to allow a certain number of delegations to express their views clearly as to how they intended to improve the concept in order to reach better implementation of the special and differential provisions.","WTCOMTDm19.pdf","Morocco, WTO, WTO, Committee, on, Trade, and, Development, Secretariat, WTO, Members, Egypt"
"1274",1274,"36","36.     The representative of Egypt considered the new document an improvement over earlier versions. With the new document, it was possible to launch a process of addressing the issue of special and differential provisions in depth. The issue of special and differential provisions was a fundamental cross-cutting issue for developing countries. It reflected how the multilateral trading system accommodated Members at different stages of development and it was an integral part of the balance of rights and obligations in various agreements. The issue of special and differential treatment should be addressed at two levels; the broad conceptual level and a detailed examination of the implementation of various special and differential provisions in the WTO Agreements. Conceptually, as liberalization commitments of developing countries had deepened and the trade agenda broadened it had become imperative to examine if the special and differential provisions had achieved their objectives, and if not, how they could be developed to do so. On the level of particular provisions, it was evident from the report that a number of provisions had not been adequately implemented while others had remained non-operational. It was not time to blame but rather to seriously consider, in the various bodies of the WTO, how best to implement those provisions. The Committee on Trade and Development needed to examine how to link its conceptual discussion to the detailed consideration of various provisions in other bodies. If developing countries felt that the special and differential provisions were being faithfully implemented, it would facilitate their approach to future negotiations. The issue of special and differential provisions should therefore be addressed in a constructive spirit. His delegation was in the process of formulating ideas. He suggested that the Chairman of the Committee on Trade and Development began a process of informal consultations on the issue as soon as possible.","WTCOMTDm19.pdf","Egypt, Members, WTO, WTO, Committee, on, Trade, and, Development, Chairman, Committee"
"1273",1273,"35","35.     He went on to comment on the implementation of the Agreement on Textiles and Clothing (ATC), as contained on pages 11-13 of the document. The Council for Trade in Goods had adopted a major review of the implementation of the ATC, in the first three years of its operation, (document G/C/W/105). He requested that that document be included in the database for consideration in the Committee on Trade and Development of the issue of implementation of WTO provisions in favour of developing countries. The Council for Trade in Goods had observed that only WT/COMTD/M/19 Page 10 a small number of products which had been under quota restriction had been integrated into GATT 1994 in the first three years of existence of the ATC. It was obvious from that assessment that the legitimate expectations of developing country Members that the ATC would bring significant trade liberalisation, and consequently benefits to their exporters, had not been met. Special and differential treatment had to be seen as tempering the concept of reciprocity. Together they resulted in the concept of equity and balance which was what the special and differential provisions were supposed to ensure. Unless developing country Members were able to derive the benefits they had legitimately expected from the multilateral trading system, they could not be expected to proceed further along the path of trade liberalisation. Developing countries needed a clear picture of what they had received in return for the commitments and concessions they had made by entering into the different agreements of the WTO.","WTCOMTDm19.pdf","ATC, Council, for, Trade, in, Goods, ATC, Committee, on, Trade, and, Development, WTO, Council, for, Trade, in, Goods, GATT, ATC, Members, ATC, Members, WTO"
"1272",1272,"34","34.     Another issue his delegation wished to address was that of the implementation of the General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS), especially the remarks in the implementation column on page 38 of document WT/COMTD/W/35 relating to the preparatory work for the next round of negotiations in services. He requested the Secretariat of the Committee on Trade and Development to coordinate with other parts of the Secretariat to prepare a factual background note on the results of the sectoral negotiations in services in the past three years, namely, financial services, basic telecommunications and movement of natural persons. Such a factual background note should provide the Committee with relevant data for assessing the benefits that developing countries to date had drawn from the operation of the GATS. He also requested the Secretariat to coordinate its efforts to provide the Committee with a factual document indicating sectors of specific export interest for developing countries in the area of trade in services. That request was made with specific reference to page 38 of the document. Such a database should provide developing country Members with important information before participating in the work of the Council for Trade in Services on the negotiating guidelines for the next round.","WTCOMTDm19.pdf","General, Agreement, on, Trade, in, Services, Secretariat, Committee, on, Trade, and, Development, Secretariat, Committee, GATS, Secretariat, Committee, Members, Council, for, Trade, in, Services"
"1271",1271,"33","33.     He continued by saying that a major area of concern was the non-implementation of provisions with regard to the Agreement on Technical Barriers to Trade (TBT), as reflected on pages 17-21. Not a single provision relating to the special and differential treatment contained in Article 12 of the TBT Agreement had been implemented during the first three years of operation of the Agreement. The Committee on Trade and Development, with its specific terms of reference, should therefore ensure that the forward looking programme of implementation of the TBT Agreement was being operationalized. His delegation requested that the issue be treated in the Committee on Trade and Development, perhaps jointly with the Committee on Technical Barriers to Trade.

The representative of India said that special and differential provisions constituted an integral part of the WTO Agreement and that it was therefore important to assess the status of the implementation of those provisions in the context of the functioning of the WTO in the first three years of the Organization's existence. Any such assessment would be made with the objective of ensuring that the legitimate expectations of developing countries were being met. His delegation realized that it was difficult to make an assessment of the implementation of the preambles of different WTO Agreements. The preambles were nonetheless integral parts of individual agreements which gave the totality of the objective of the Agreement, especially as related the raising of standards of living and meeting the needs of developing countries. Ways should therefore be sought to assess how the objectives of the agreements, as contained in the preambular provisions, were being operationalized.","WTCOMTDm19.pdf","India, WTO, WTO, WTO"
"1269",1269,"31","31.     The Chairman said that at its last meeting in November, the Committee on Trade and Development had requested the Secretariat to update document WT/COMTD/W/33 in line with suggestions made by delegations and had agreed to revert to the item at today's meeting. The Secretariat had circulated a new document, WT/COMTD/W/35, dated 11 February 1998 which attempted to update and supplement document WT/COMTD/W/33 so as to provide comprehensive information on actions taken pursuant to WTO provisions in favour of developing country Members. In the case of a number of these provisions, the Secretariat had not found it possible to insert                                                                                      WT/COMTD/M/19                                                                                              Page 9 meaningful information on the implementation of the provisions. That was the case most particularly for provisions of a preambular nature and for provisions that called on Members autonomously to take account of the trade interests of developing country Members in the course of implementing the WTO Agreements. The Secretariat had exercised constraint in the amount of detail provided in the document to avoid it becoming a document of unworkable size. Delegations interested in more detailed information were kindly referred to work being undertaken in other parts of the Secretariat. In particular, in the area of agriculture, an informal paper on Special and Differential Treatment Provisions Relating to the Agreement on Agriculture had been circulated on 16 February.","WTCOMTDm19.pdf","Chairman, Committee, on, Trade, and, Development, Secretariat, Secretariat, WTO, Members, Secretariat, Members, Members, WTO, Secretariat, Secretariat"

The representative of India said that, as mentioned in the report, technical assistance should continue to be demand driven and based on the expertise available in the WTO Secretariat. With regard to the Information Technologies for Development Project, mentioned on page 6 of the report, he asked whether any assessment had been made of the status of the infrastructure relevant to the use of information technology in developing countries. Specifically, how did the planners of this project assess the status of the power and telecommunications sectors of developing countries? Such an assessment was necessary in order to ensure that developing countries could access and use the valuable information available electronically. His delegation appreciated the detail given on page 7 on the demand for technical cooperation in the area of dispute settlement, but asked whether any assessment had been made of the availability and utilization of resources under Article 27.2 of the Dispute Settlement Understanding. The growing number of developing countries involved in the dispute settlement process might create a need to enhance the budgetary allocation for technical cooperation in that area. One way of making such an assessment could be for developing country Members to discuss, in the Committee on Trade and Development, their views on the resources available.","WTCOMTDm19.pdf","India, WTO, Secretariat, Information, Technologies, for, Development, Project, Members, Committee, on, Trade, and, Development"

The representative of United States wished to see a small change in the wording of the introduction where it said that more than three quarters of the WTO Members had the status of developing countries.

The representative of Morocco said that the new document fully reflected what a manual on technical cooperation should be and his delegation wished to see it adopted immediately by the Committee so that it could be published and disseminated to the Members. The Manual would allow Members to make better use of WTO Technical Cooperation activities. It would also allow the WTO to make its policy on technical cooperation more active. His delegation agreed with what had been said by the delegation of Tanzania on least-developed countries. The Manual could contribute to rectify the tendency of only a small share of WTO technical assistance activities benefitting least- developed countries.","WTCOMTDm19.pdf","Morocco, Committee, Members, Members, WTO, WTO, Tanzania, WTO"
"1263",1263,"26","26.     The Chairman recalled that, at its last meeting, on 17 November 1997, the Committee on Trade and Development had requested the Secretariat to come forward with an amended version of the Manual on Technical Cooperation and Training for consideration at the following meeting of the Committee. Document WT/COMTD/W/37 had been prepared in view of that request and was a considerably shortened version of the initial Manual.","WTCOMTDm19.pdf","Chairman, Committee, on, Trade, and, Development, Secretariat, Committee"

"1261",1261,"24","24.      In response to the proposal to move from seminars to individual technical missions, the Secretariat said that delegations should not be misled by the word seminar. Seminars, such as the seven held on the GATS before the Financial Services negotiations were as good as any technical mission. The difference between seminars and one-to-one technical missions was that when the Secretariat wished to deliver training to a number of countries there was a seminar, while technical missions only benefitted the country in which it was held. In the case of services, a technical mission could have been sent to all participating WTO Members which would have amounted to over a hundred missions; instead the Secretariat had covered all Members and countries in accession with seven seminars. Had delegations meant to refer to general seminars as opposed to specialized seminars or had delegations meant moving away from specialized seminars to technical missions? The reliance on the seminar method was a result of the lack of resources, both personnel and financial. Regarding least-developed countries, the representative of Tanzania had noted that only few technical assistance activities had benefitted least-developed countries. He provided part of the answer himself by referring to the demand-driven approach. However, it might be reassuring that in the course of the implementation of the recommendations of the High-Level Meeting on Integrated Initiatives for Least-Developed Countries' Trade Development, programmes were to be organized for all countries having responded to the needs-assessment request and even to some of the least-developed countries that had not responded to the request. Regional workshops with intensive training would be provided. Moreover, two intensive trade-policy courses were to be organized. Next years report on WTO technical cooperation activities would therefore show a significant increase in technical assistance to least-developed countries. With regard to technical assistance given under Article 27.2 of the Dispute Settlement Understanding, two professionals, apart from the staff members of the Technical Cooperation and Training Division, were mandated to give technical assistance to any delegation requesting it. However, it was important to note that there was a limit to the assistance that the staff or the professional consultants could give. They could not be involved in the process of submitting or WT/COMTD/M/19 Page 8 drafting statements or submissions for the dispute settlement process. That was at least not the way in which the Secretariat had envisaged the assistance to be provided. Rather, developing country Members were helped with advice and material in the preparatory stage. If the Member decided to go ahead with the process, the submissions had to be drafted by the Member itself with the consultant thereafter commenting on them. A modest increase in the available resources for such technical assistance had been envisaged in expectation that the dispute settlement process increasingly would involve developing countries, both as complainants and as defendants.","WTCOMTDm19.pdf","Secretariat, Secretariat, WTO, Members, Secretariat, Members, Tanzania, WTO, Technical, Cooperation, and, Training, Division, Secretariat, Members, Member, Member"
"1260",1260,"23","23.      The Secretariat continued by saying that the Integrated Technical Cooperation Programme for Africa with ITC and UNCTAD had been subsumed under the Integrated Framework for Trade- Related Technical Assistance, including for Human and Institutional Capacity-Building, to Support Least-Developed Countries in Their Trade and Trade-Related Activities as far as the four least- developed countries included in that Programme were concerned. That was a major contribution to the follow-up to the High-Level Meeting on Integrated Initiatives for Least-Developed Countries' Trade Development. An evaluation of the Africa Programme was required under the Programme itself and had been discussed with donors, the beneficiary countries and the three institutions. An evaluation would be undertaken in due course. The Secretariat had also taken note of the suggestions made to involve research institutions and universities in WTO courses. Courses already had such participation to some extent but there was no defined policy to that effect. It was clear that several least-developed and other developing countries did not have a representation in Geneva. The WTO Secretariat tried to take that into consideration in increasingly cooperating with Secretariats of other Organizations such as the Commonwealth Secretariat, the ACP Secretariat and the Forum Secretariat. As a result of the follow-up to the High-Level Meeting on Integrated Initiatives for Least-Developed Countries' Trade Development, technical cooperation activities benefitting least-developed countries would increase. The first three-week trade policy course for English-speaking least-developed countries was to be held in Geneva in late April, and the first for French-speaking countries in the early autumn. To hold three-week courses was something new to the programme of technical cooperation.","WTCOMTDm19.pdf","Secretariat, Integrated, Technical, Cooperation, Programme, Africa, ITC, UNCTAD, Integrated, Framework, for, Trade, Africa, Programme, Secretariat, WTO, Geneva, WTO, Secretariat, Commonwealth, Secretariat, ACP, Secretariat, Forum, Secretariat, Geneva"
"1259",1259,"22","22.      The Secretariat responded to questions asked. With respect to taking into account infrastructural problems in developing countries when carrying out the information for technology project, given the large number of countries that the WTO Secretariat had linked-up to the Internet it was obvious that there were countries with infrastructural problems among those. Twenty-two least- developed countries had so far been linked-up and it was expected that by end of the year 36 least- developed countries would have benefitted from the project. The main infrastructural problem was the weakness of the telephone lines. There was cooperation at the technical level with the International Telecommunications Union (ITU) in launching satellites which would reduce the problems of weak telecommunication networks. Several delegations had made reference to the fact that the resources of the Secretariat for technical cooperation in relation to dispute settlement was                                                                                    WT/COMTD/M/19                                                                                            Page 7 currently being discussed in the Budget Committee. In addition to the external experts available in the Secretariat for developing country Members under Article 27.2 of the Dispute Settlement Understanding, the Secretariat had two staff members available in the Technical Cooperation and Training Division. The Secretariat had taken note of the request to shift from seminars to technical expert missions. The technical cooperation activities were already going in that direction. However, the Secretariat would continue to respond to requests for seminars.","WTCOMTDm19.pdf","Secretariat, WTO, Secretariat, International, Telecommunications, Union, ITU, Secretariat, Budget, Committee, Secretariat, Members, Secretariat, Technical, Cooperation, and, Training, Division, Secretariat, Secretariat"
"1258",1258,"21","21.     The Chairman said that the Committee seemed to agree that technical assistance in principle should be demand-driven but that the aspect of real need also had to be considered. Some countries had difficulty in formulating their needs as had been noted in connection with the High-Level Meeting on Integrated Initiatives for Least-Developed Countries' Trade Development. Issues relating to evaluation had been raised by many delegations. Questions touched on whether an evaluation should be internal or external and on the criteria to be used. It was high time to consider those aspects in order to see if WTO technical cooperation activities headed in the right direction. He therefore asked the Secretariat to look at those issues. The question of coordination and the need to avoid overlap had also been treated. Optimum use of available resources outside the WTO should be assured. The academia, the private sector and NGOs should be involved. Another issue raised was the large increase in the demand for technical assistance activities and whether that was sustainable given the available budgetary resources. There was a need for the Chair of the Committee on Trade and Development to consult with the Budget Committee on that issue. Whether less emphasis should be put on seminars and more on other technical cooperation activities was another issue discussed.","WTCOMTDm19.pdf","Chairman, Committee, WTO, Secretariat, WTO, Committee, on, Trade, and, Development, Budget, Committee"
"1257",1257,"20","20.      The representative of Australia noted the large increase in technical assistance activities and the significant additional demands that this placed on the WTO and would continue to place during the coming years, particularly in light of an increasing membership and an increasing number of implementation commitments which would fall due in the medium term. With regard to the general issue of how the organization approached those demands, she said that the point on coordination with the Budget Committee, as raised by the representative of Hong Kong, China, was important. The approach had to be coherent both within the organization and in relation to other organizations in the Integrated Framework for Trade-Related Technical Assistance, including for Human and Institutional Capacity-Building, to Support Least-Developed Countries in Their Trade and Trade-Related Activities. With regard to evaluation she said that with increasing demands it was important that the resources were used in the most effective way. An evaluation could also be useful in highlighting broader issues and constraints in the delivery of technical assistance. Delegations were already aware of some constraints such as human-resource constraints in the Secretariat. Her delegation noted with interest the point made by Egypt about the seminar format versus other kinds of technical assistance.","WTCOMTDm19.pdf","Australia, WTO, Budget, Committee, Hong, Kong, China, Integrated, Framework, for, Trade-Related, Technical, Assistance, Secretariat, Egypt"
"1256",1256,"2","2.      The Chairman said that the Secretariat had prepared a report on all technical cooperation and training activities carried out in 1997 (WT/COMTD/W/36). The report followed broadly the same format as that of the previous year with corrigenda 1 and 2 complementing the information on two specific points. It provided a broad overview of the various types of activities undertaken and their regional distribution. The tables annexed to the document provided details on each activity. The report covered activities funded from the regular budget for technical cooperation and training, as well as those financed by the WTO Trust Fund. The vast majority had been funded through extra- budgetary resources.","WTCOMTDm19.pdf","Chairman, Secretariat, WTO, Trust, Fund"
"1255",1255,"19","19.     The representative of Bangladesh said that it was clear that there was a consensus that technical activities were highly desirable and should continue. The question of sustainability of the programme needed to be considered carefully. The dependence on donations from generous Members had been sustaining the programme for years. He therefore urged that ways be found to include the costs for technical assistance within the regular budget. His delegation had expected to see more tangible results from follow-up activities to the High-Level Meeting on Integrated Initiatives for Least-Developed Countries' Trade Development mentioned in the report. The tables showed a spectacular growth in technical cooperation activities, but it did not give a figure as to the least- developed countries' share. He agreed with the representative of Tanzania who had pointed out that the need rather than the demand sometimes had to be taken into consideration, especially with respect to non-Geneva based least-developed countries. The most needed might not even be aware of the existence of available technical assistance services.","WTCOMTDm19.pdf","Bangladesh, Members, Integrated, Initiatives, for, Least-Developed, Countries, ', Trade, Development, Tanzania"
"1254",1254,"18","18.      The representative of Tanzania said that his delegation was of the view that as time went on the emphasis of WTO technical assistance should shift from seminars to more result-oriented programmes. As a result of the programme of training of trainers it might be possible for national bodies to sustain the seminar element on their own rather than it being carried out from WTO headquarters in Geneva. The rough figures on page 16 onwards showed that the level of participation of least-developed countries as beneficiaries of technical assistance programmes apart from the High- Level Meeting on Integrated Initiatives for Least-Developed Countries' Trade Development was unsatisfactory. Out of 44 national seminars conducted in 1997 less than 7 related to least-developed countries, and out of 55 technical assistance missions conducted in 1997, only about 9 related to least- developed countries. Out of 78 listed workshops, conferences, symposia, round tables and training courses only 3 to 4 related to least-developed countries. Those figures made him doubtful as to the general increase in the level of participation. He therefore urged the Secretariat to be more out- reaching to least-developed countries and involve more least-developed countries in its programmes. He did not oppose the general philosophy of technical assistance being demand-driven, but he appreciated that one of the reasons for the weak participation of the least-developed countries was related to the fact that not many of them were represented in Geneva. It was then not too much to ask for the WTO Secretariat to reach out to its non-Geneva-based least-developed country Members and include them in its technical assistance programmes. Less than half of the 29 least-developed countries which were WTO Members participated in technical cooperation activities. Although there had been a general increase in technical assistance, the figures should be analyzed carefully and ways had to be found to ensure that least-developed countries benefitted more from WTO technical assistance.

"1253",1253,"17","17.      The representative of Uganda found the increased demand for technical assistance a positive sign of developing countries taking advantage of the opportunities that the programme of technical cooperation offered. There was a need for collaboration between the Committee on Trade and Development and the Budget Committee to ensure that the priorities set by the Committee on Trade and Development were respected when the Budget Committee considered the appropriation of funds. Uganda had been one of the beneficiary countries and he welcomed the emphasis that had been put on least-developed countries in general and Africa in particular. As the report showed, emphasis had been put on making the beneficiaries understand the WTO system and conform to its rules. He therefore urged the Committee on Trade and Development to look at how to develop long-term capability. It should not only be the few officials trained in Geneva who understood the system, but they should continue to strengthen the capabilities of their countries. The training of trainers programme was therefore welcome, as participating officials went back to their respective countries to pass on the messages. A link to universities was also desirable as universities should be able to continuously supply skilled officials to operate in the system. It was too optimistic to train a trainer in a one week course and expect him to grasp the whole WTO complex and go back and efficiently train others. Longer term training should be considered so that universities acquired lecturers with good knowledge about the various aspects of international trade law and other issues pertinent to the multilateral trading system. With regard to the High-Level Meeting on Integrated Initiatives for Least-Developed Countries' Trade Development his delegation had emphasized the need to look beyond the Geneva-based organizations in terms of coordination if the Committee was ready to factor supply constraints into the programme that had been designed. His delegation therefore wished to hear about the coordination with the Bretton Woods institutions. He asked whether the policy discussed in the WTO had been incorporated in the policy framework papers of the Bretton Woods institutions and what the follow-up vis-à-vis those institutions had been.","WTCOMTDm19.pdf","Uganda, Committee, on, Trade, and, Development, Budget, Committee, Committee, on, Trade, and, Development, Budget, Committee, Uganda, Africa, WTO, Committee, on, Trade, and, Development, Geneva, WTO, Committee, Bretton, Woods, WTO"
"1252",1252,"16","16.      The representative of the United States said that it was significant that technical assistance activities had increased by 85 per cent in 1997. That increase would go a long way toward enhancing the ability of developing countries to become acquainted with the WTO and bring their regimes into conformity with WTO requirements as well as assisting those who were interested in joining the organization. He noted the comment made by the representative of Egypt that the WTO should get away from the seminars format and engage more in hands-on activities. That had also been a goal expressed clearly by a number of delegations during High-Level Meeting on Integrated Initiatives for Least-Developed Countries' Trade Development. Hong Kong, China's point about having an engagement with the Budget Committee made sense as concern had been expressed about the funding                                                                                       WT/COMTD/M/19                                                                                               Page 5 of the programmes. Delegations should consider how the WTO could live within its resources, taking into account the other budgetary challenges faced and to what extent the enhanced technical cooperation would have to continue to be provided by extra budgetary resources.

"1251",1251,"15","15.      The representative of Turkey said that his delegation considered technical cooperation to be one of the main activities of the WTO for developing countries, for least-developed countries and for countries in accession. Technical cooperation activities had enabled the WTO to function better as it had allowed the more effective participation of all Members in all of its bodies. His delegation noted with satisfaction the increase in technical cooperation activities in 1997 as compared to the previous year, both in number of activities and in subjects covered. Table 3 on page 5 showed new subjects such as accession for which there had been no activity in 1996 and for which there had been 18 activities in 1997. Likewise, no activity with respect to the use of technology for development had been undertaken in 1996, while 7 had been undertaken in 1997. The preparation and follow-up to the High-Level Meeting on Integrated Initiatives for Least-Developed Countries' Trade Development had also -been a new activity in 1997. The Dispute Settlement System was mentioned on page 7, paragraph 5. In view of the enhanced interest in that field, the Secretariat should envisage a supplementary effort by increasing services rendered by professional consultants and by increasing training courses in Geneva as well as national and regional seminars.","WTCOMTDm19.pdf","Turkey, WTO, WTO, Members, Integrated, Initiatives, for, Least-Developed, Countries, ', Trade, Development, Secretariat, Geneva"

The representative of Myanmar, speaking on behalf of ASEAN, said that ASEAN believed that briefing sessions were useful, especially for delegations from least-developed countries. Briefing sessions should continue to be held to enhance the understanding of the various WTO Agreements. Briefing sessions enabled least-developed countries to participate meaningfully in the WTO. On the Dispute Settlement Understanding, as reflected in sub-section 5 on page 7 of the report, he shared the views expressed by the delegation of India in light of the great involvement of developing countries in the Dispute Settlement Process. Technical assistance had to be demand-driven. He did took note of the interpretation by the European Communities of the term demand driven. His delegation believed that demand driven entailed more of a bottom-up approach than a top-down one.","WTCOMTDm19.pdf","Myanmar, ASEAN, ASEAN, WTO, WTO, India"
"1249",1249,"13","13.     The representative of Canada agreed with Egypt's presentation of five positive elements. Her delegation suggested to countries that found it pertinent that they consider including a broader audience in the WTO technical assistance activities, possibly including non-governmental organizations, think-tanks, research organizations and the private sector. That could help create networks in developing countries, hence ensuring a basis for consensus to push for necessary reforms.","WTCOMTDm19.pdf","Canada, Egypt, WTO"
"1248",1248,"12","12.      The representative of Hong Kong, China observed that the demand for technical assistance activities had increased significantly which was an encouraging sign. However, the costs of those activities had risen to outstrip the resources available in the regular WTO budget. Total estimated expenditure in 1998 would be in the order of SwF4.9 million, whereas the regular budget allocation was only SwF0.74 million. That shortfall was, as the report noted, currently largely made good through extra budgetary resources. His delegation doubted whether a degree of dependence on extra budgetary resources of that magnitude was desirable or sustainable over time. Without prejudging that issue, his delegation saw benefit in enhanced dialogue and enhanced coordination between the Committee on Trade and Development and the Budget Committee so that policy could be developed with full regard to resource implications and so that technical assistance could be smoothly planned. He hoped that future reports along the lines of WT/COMTD/W/36 would provide more information on the financial resources involved.","WTCOMTDm19.pdf","Hong, Kong, China, WTO, Committee, on, Trade, and, Development, and, the, Budget, Committee"

The representative of Morocco was happy to note that Africa's share of the budget for technical cooperation had increased and his delegation hoped that that trend would be maintained in the future as Africa's need for technical assistance was great. He underlined that the previous year his delegation had asked for an evaluation of the Integrated Technical Assistance Programme in Selected Least-Developed and Other African Countries. The Secretariat had responded then that too little time had elapsed since the launching of that programme and that it was therefore premature to carry out an evaluation. The moment had come for the Secretariat to proceed with an evaluation of the Integrated Programme, as UNCTAD and ITC had also been asked to do. The evaluation should be independent. The best way to carry out the evaluation would be through the appointment of an independent external evaluator. Two aspects should be looked at more deeply. First, coordination between the three organizations; had the objectives set by the three organizations been reached? Second, the performance of the instruments used in providing technical assistance should be evaluated. The evaluation should be continuous, allowing for the improvement of the content at the national level. Seminars were useful, but that they should not outweigh other modes of delivery. Consultation services by country and topic were efficient and would have a greater impact on the capacity of developing countries.","WTCOMTDm19.pdf","Morocco, Africa, Africa, Integrated, Technical, Assistance, Programme, Secretariat, Secretariat, Integrated, Programme, UNCTAD, ITC"

Her delegation noted with pleasure that Box 3 had been revised to include a reference to the Integrated WTO/UNCTAD/ITC Technical Assistance Programme for Selected Least-Developed and Other African Countries which, for the four least-developed countries included, would be subsumed by the Integrated Framework endorsed at the High-Level Meeting. Other updates could be made in a similar vein, for instance on page 17 where regular courses for developing countries were mentioned. She did not agree to delete the section on ""Cooperation with other International Organizations"", since her delegation attached much importance to such cooperation and preferred to strengthen that part of the document and include a reference to the conclusions of the High-Level Meeting. In referring to page 24 in the Box relating to ""Coordination with Other International Organizations"" she said that most, rather than some, activities called for coordination between international organizations.","WTCOMTDM18.pdf","European, Communities, Integrated, WTO/UNCTAD/ITC, Technical, Assistance, Programme, Integrated, Framework"

For example, he suggested deleting the section on page 20 on ""Cooperation with other International Organizations"", as well as Box 18. Once it had been mentioned that extra-budgetary resources existed and that some Members participated in trust funds it was not useful to mention how much they each provided. Those interested by the figures could get them from the Budget Committee. The section on ""Coordination of Technical Cooperation within the WTO"" on page 9 was too long. Box 3, as amended, needed to be shortened as well.

The representative of Egypt said that the international community was witnessing recent developments of the Internet and the technology associated with it that provided new opportunities for the expansion of trade in both goods and services in developed and developing countries alike. There was no doubt that electronic trade would increase significantly in the years to come. A number of international organizations had started to address issues related to electronic trade in an active manner, like UNCTAD, and UNCITRAL. WTO was in the process of creating a trade database and cooperated with the World Bank in a project related to information technology. Furthermore, the High-Level Meeting for Least-Developed Countries had addressed the issue of the use of Information Technology as a means to enhance exports from LDCs. It would therefore be appropriate to discuss the issue of electronic-trade in goods and services in the Committee on Trade and Development and his delegation intended to present an informal paper to the Committee. He suggested that an item be added to the agenda of the next Committee meeting relating to electronic trade in goods and services.

"1228",1228,"58","58.      The representative of Egypt said that the issue of the review of participation of developing country members in the multilateral trading system was an issue of importance to developing countries. His delegation was of the view that consideration of this issue could be done in a much more effective way. The terms of reference of the Committee on Trade and Development indicated that the Committee should keep under review the participation of developing country Members in the multilateral trading system and consider measures and initiatives to assist developing country Members, in particular the least-developed country Members, in the expansion of their trade and investment opportunities. He was of the view that the way in which the issue had been dealt with could be strengthened in order to satisfy the terms of reference. He hoped that this would be achieved when considering the item during the coming year as it was too late for the approach to be adopted for the current year. He then turned to the document itself and said that his delegation welcomed a reference to developing countries with successful trade performances. However, this had to be put into its context as had been done in paragraph two which indicated that, in 1996, the trade share of developing countries had, for the first time, risen above its 1985 level. That was the context in which the discussion should take place and it showed that much remained to be done. The trade performance of African and the Middle Eastern countries three years after the entry into force of the WTO Agreements remained disappointing. As was mentioned in paragraph 8, the share of world exports accounted for by developing countries in Africa and in the Middle East had declined over the past decade. Paragraph 8 only indicated that there had been a decline, without further analysing its reasons. His delegation considered it necessary to analyze why the trade share of these developing countries had been declining. The difficulties should       1    The Committee on Trade and Development's Annual Report was subsequently circulated in document WT/COMTD/13.

The kind of assistance required to help those countries enhance their trade performance was to be analyzed as well. A more detailed analysis, on a less aggregated level, should be undertaken with regard to the issue. Whether the analysis should be limited to trade in goods or whether it should also include trade in services was another issue to consider. Consideration of this item should help developing countries address issues relating to their share of world trade and their participation in the multilateral trading system. He proposed that the Secretariat prepare an outline of a study for the Committee to assess and to indicate its desired direction. The inclusion of trade in services was one of the elements his delegation was willing to consider. An analysis of the participation of developing countries in world trade would require something more elaborate than the eight pages provided in document WT/COMTD/W/31. Some conclusion were called for, especially indicating areas where technical assistance was needed.","WTCOMTDM18.pdf","Egypt, Committee, on, Trade, and, Development, Committee, Members, Members, Members, WTO, Africa, Middle, East, Committee, on, Trade, and, Development, Secretariat, Committee"
"1227",1227,"57","57.      The Chairman said that at its Meeting in September, the Committee on Trade and Development had had a preliminary discussion on the item, based on a Note prepared by the Secretariat (document WT/COMTD/W/31). At that meeting, delegations had expressed the wish that the subject become a standing item on the agenda of the Committee. The view had also been expressed that the intention of a further discussion on this item in the Committee should not be to revise the document as the purpose of the document had only been to provide elements for delegations to react to.","WTCOMTDM18.pdf","Chairman, Committee, on, Trade, and, Development, Secretariat, Committee, Committee"

After some discussion in which several delegations suggested that the Report be as factual as possible, the Chairman noted that there was agreement to delete certain lines in paragraphs 7 and 4 and that a reference to follow-up activities should be added to paragraphs 7 and 13. He prosed that the Committee on Trade and Development adopt the Report on that basis and request the Secretariat to amend and complete the Report taking into account the Committee's discussion.","WTCOMTDM18.pdf","Chairman, Committee, on, Trade, and, Development, Secretariat, Committee"
"1224",1224,"54","54.      The Chairman said that at the Committee on Trade and Development's last meeting, he had noted that the General Council would undertake an annual overview of WTO activities at its last meeting of the year, scheduled for 10 December. For the purpose of this overview, the General Council would WT/COMTD/M/18 Page 12 need the Committee's Annual Report for 1997. The form that the Report should take was indicated in the General Council's Decision on Reporting Procedures in document WT/L/105. It should be brief, factual in nature and provide an indication of the actions and decisions taken by the Committee during 1997. The Secretariat had prepared a draft Report along those lines, circulated in document WT/COMTD/W/34, which was before the Committee for its consideration and adoption. The current meeting's discussion should, of course, also be reflected in the Report. In order to avoid meeting again, and in conformity with the wish of many delegations to reduce the number of meetings, he would ask the Committee after the discussion to mandate the Secretariat to complete the Report, taking into account the current discussion.","WTCOMTDM18.pdf","Chairman, Committee, on, Trade, and, Development, General, Council, WTO, General, Council, Committee, General, Council, Committee, Secretariat, Committee, Committee, Secretariat"

The representative of the European Communities said that her delegation was committed to the better integration of the least-developed countries into the world trading system. The High-Level Meeting was not a one-off event but a starting point of a process and her delegation intended to build upon it. However, special efforts directed towards the least-developed countries should not allow Members to neglect all the other developing countries and the specific commitments that had been entered into in that regard, and which had been included in the conclusions of the Uruguay Round. The regular monitoring of the implementation of the special provisions in favour of developing countries was necessary to keep the focus and to put pressure on their implementation. Document WT/COMTD/W/33 showed that the Committee on Trade and Development was on the right track. Her delegation welcomed the announcement by the delegation of Pakistan that it would present an informal paper on ways to operationalize certain provisions. The debate on these matters could be used as an occasion to capture useful hints on what the actual concerns of developing countries were so that delegations could work together in a constructive spirit.","WTCOMTDM18.pdf","Members, Uruguay, Round, Committee, on, Trade, and, Development, Pakistan"

Regarding the provisions which had not yet been operationalized, as they did not provide for action per se, his delegation suggested that they should be further explored by the Committee on Trade and Development at a subsequent meeting and that appropriate action should be taken for full implementation.","WTCOMTDM18.pdf","Myanmar, ASEAN, Pakistan, Uruguay, Committee, on, Trade, and, Development"

However, the data that was available generally showed                                                                            WT/COMTD/M/18                                                                            Page 11 that the provisions with respect to developing countries were on track which was an encouraging sign in terms of the obligations that all Members had taken. His delegation looked forward to discussions regarding specific measures. In terms of obligations by developed countries his delegation was of the view that one measure that should be taken into account in terms of the special treatment developed countries provided to developing countries was the growth in exports of developing countries since the Uruguay Round. Developing countries in general, excluding a number of least-developed countries, had improved their exports and that was related to the commitments in the Uruguay Round. He also noted that part of the progress of the many provisions in favour of developing countries had been that they allowed those countries to modify regimes and implement trade-creating liberalizing policies during the transition periods that were provided. This would benefit developing countries in the longer term. Those particular provisions could always be seen as a double-edged sword, but nonetheless, his delegation was of the opinion that the process was healthy and deserved the sort of review that had been initially suggested by the representative of Pakistan.","WTCOMTDM18.pdf","United, States, Members, Uruguay, Round, Uruguay, Round, Pakistan"
"1217",1217,"48","48.      The representative of Morocco said that his delegation supported the intervention made by the representative of Pakistan. According to its mandate, the Committee on Trade and Development was the appropriate body for discussing special and differential measures in favour of developing countries. The special and differential measures in favour of developing countries constituted the development dimension of international trade and were an integral part of the obligations that WTO Members had committed themselves to in the GATT 47, the GATT 94, and in the WTO Agreements. The Committee should examine the implementation of those provisions and, with the help of the Secretariat, examine what the problems were; first for the developed countries to implement certain provisions, and second for developing countries as regards provisions that had not been used. The Committee should particularly examine the difficulties of non-implementation in order to arrive at the implementation of a large part of the provisions which were of great importance to developing countries. The document was a step towards full application of all special and differential provisions in favour of developing countries. The Item should remain on the agenda of the Committee. It was only in that way that developing countries could be encouraged to participate fully in an equal manner in the international trading system.","WTCOMTDM18.pdf","Morocco, Pakistan, Committee, on, Trade, and, Development, WTO, Members, GATT, GATT, WTO, Committee, Secretariat, Committee, Committee"

Since document WT/COMTD/W/33 was rather incomplete he suggested that it be completed incorporating all points made by the delegation of Pakistan. Only a few of the special and differential provisions in favour of developing countries had been implemented. He stressed the need for the implementation of those provisions and strongly supported that the document be updated and presented to the Committee on Trade and Development at its next Meeting.","WTCOMTDM18.pdf","India, Pakistan, Pakistan, Committee, on, Trade, and, Development"
"1215",1215,"46","46.      The representative of Egypt said that his delegation supported the gist of the intervention made by the representative of Pakistan. His delegation attached great importance to the issue of special and differential treatment for developing countries. It was an integral part of the balance of rights and obligations in various Agreements. He realized that it was sometimes difficult for the Secretariat to evaluate and pronounce itself on the effectiveness of the implementation of various provisions. His delegation was aware of the fact that some of the provisions were of a general nature and needed to be made operational. It was working on some specific ideas in that respect which it hoped to present to the Committee on Trade and Development shortly. He suggested keeping the item on the Agenda. and reiterated that proper implementation of the special and differential treatment to developing countries would send a positive signal for future anticipated negotiations on the built-in agenda. If developing countries felt that those provisions were being faithfully implemented, it would facilitate their approach to future negotiations.","WTCOMTDM18.pdf","Egypt, Pakistan, Secretariat, Committee, on, Trade, and, Development"
"1214",1214,"45","45.    The representative of Pakistan further said that after careful reading of the document, his impression was that most of the provisions were yet to be properly operationalized. Keeping in mind the importance of the issue for developing countries and the mandate of the Committee on Trade and WT/COMTD/M/18 Page 10 Development in this regard, his delegation suggested that the Committee should arrange for an in-depth consideration of the issue in order to ensure that all the provisions in favour of developing countries were implemented. To facilitate such a consideration by the Committee his delegation requested the Secretariat to update the document WT/COMTD/W/33 by seeking full and complete information regarding all the provisions in favour of developing countries from the relevant divisions of the WTO. These could also provide, where appropriate, the reasons for non-implementation. That information would help the Committee in identifying clearly the provisions that had not been operationalized so far, and, at least in some cases, the reasons for such non-implementation. His delegation proposed that the information should be collected before the next meeting of the Committee and that the item be placed on the Agenda of the Committee's next meeting. The Committee would then be in a position to hold in-depth discussions and report to the General Council for appropriate action. His delegation would, for its part, be working to identify some important provisions that needed to be operationalized and might present, in an informal paper, suggestions on ways to operationalize those provisions.","WTCOMTDM18.pdf","Pakistan, Committee, on, Trade, Committee, Committee, Secretariat, WTO, Committee, Committee, Committee, Committee, General, Council"
"1213",1213,"44","44.      The representative of Pakistan went on to say that the information contained in document WT/COMTD/W/33 needed to be supplemented in several areas and, in addition, certain questions needed to be addressed. Those concerned some of his delegation's specific concerns. First, the Secretariat not did not provide information with regard to all the provisions in favour of developing countries in the multilateral agreements and ministerial decisions. A complete compilation of all the provisions had been prepared in document WT/COMTD/W/510 in November 1994. A comparison of the present document with the 1994 compilation showed that almost half the provisions had not been reported upon. Second, even in the present document, many provisions had been mentioned without any information regarding their implementation. Some of these provisions were Articles 10:1 and 10:2 and Annex B, paragraph 2 of the SPS Agreement, Articles 12:2, 12:3, 12:5, 12:6, 12:9 of the TBT Agreement, Annex III, paragraph 5 of the Agreement on Customs Valuation, Articles 1:2 and 3:5(j) of the Agreement on Import Licensing Procedures, Articles 27:7, 27:8, 27:9 and 27:15 of the Agreement on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures, Articles 66:2 of the TRIPS Agreement, etc. Third, there was a number of provisions in the present document where the information given in the column for implementation was not complete. Most of the responses on provisions in the dispute settlement understanding fell into that category. It was, for those reasons, difficult to obtain a complete and satisfactory understanding of the status of the implementation and use of special provisions in favour of developing countries.","WTCOMTDM18.pdf","Pakistan, Secretariat, Annex, III, Customs, Valuation, Import, Licensing, Procedures"
"1212",1212,"43","43.      The representative of Pakistan continued and said that, for a proper perspective it was important to note that special and differential treatment for developing countries constituted an integral part of Members' contractual obligations. Part IV of GATT 1947 had been negotiated in recognition of special conditions and needs for developing countries in view of their level of development. Part IV was still relevant as it had been incorporated into GATT 1994 by inference. Many other specific provisions for special and differential treatment of developing countries were also included in different WTO Agreements under the Uruguay Round. It should also be noted that these provisions aimed at creating a balance as developing countries had accepted wider and more strenuous obligations in many areas during the Uruguay Round. It was therefore imperative that the provisions for special and differential treatment of developing countries, as embodied in WTO Agreements, were fully implemented so that the balance of rights and obligations would be maintained.","WTCOMTDM18.pdf","Pakistan, Members, GATT, GATT, WTO, Uruguay, Uruguay, WTO"
"1211",1211,"42","42.     The representative of Pakistan noted that the Committee on Trade and Development was the forum to deliberate upon all the aspects of the issue and that Items three and four of the Committee's terms of reference were relevant for that purpose. Specifically, Item four of the Committee's terms of reference mandated the Committee to consider any question that might arise with regard to the application of special provisions in the multilateral trading agreements and related ministerial decisions in favour of developing countries and to report to the General Council for appropriate action. The experience of developing countries in the multilateral trading agreements and related ministerial decisions in the past two years had raised certain questions which had to be discussed in the Committee.","WTCOMTDM18.pdf","Pakistan, Committee, on, Trade, and, Development, Committee, Committee, Committee, General, Council, Committee"
"1210",1210,"41","41.    The Chairman said that following statements made at the meetings of the Committee on Trade and Development earlier in the year and following his informal consultations with delegations, it had been decided at the Committee's September Meeting to include this item on the agenda of its next meeting. The Secretariat had prepared a Note as background for the discussion, which had been                                                                             WT/COMTD/M/18                                                                             Page 9 circulated in document WT/COMTD/W/33. The document contained a compilation of information provided by the Secretariat on the implementation of the Uruguay Round results during 1997. Information received at a later stage, such as that related to GATS, would be circulated in an addendum to this document. The debate should allow the Committee to evaluate to what extent and how the different provisions were applied or used by developing countries since the Committee's review last year. He also wished to encourage delegations to provide the Committee with information as to their experience with the implementation of provisions since some of the provisions in favour of LDCs were triggered only if specific requests were made.","WTCOMTDM18.pdf","Chairman, Committee, on, Trade, and, Development, Committee, Secretariat, Secretariat, Uruguay, Committee, Committee, Committee, LDCs"

The representative of Switzerland clarified that it had not been his delegation's intention to adopt the current Three Year Plan, but rather to agree on a procedure for subsequent Plans in line with the Guidelines for Technical Cooperation.

"1206",1206,"38","38.      The representative of Morocco noted that other organizations like UNCTAD did not adopt, but took note, of their technical cooperation plans. This was done to avoid creating sensitivities among governments as regards the level of assistance received or earmarked. He suggested that WTO continue its practice of taking note of its Three Year Plans for Technical Cooperation.","WTCOMTDM18.pdf","Morocco, UNCTAD, WTO"
"1205",1205,"37","37.       The representative of Switzerland said that if it was an issue of principle, which meant that by taking note the Committee on Trade and Development had somehow sanctioned the procedure of taking note regularly of the Three Year Plan, then his delegation had to reserve its position for the moment. There was also a question of credibility involved. It was the role of the Committee to judge first the content of the activities in the Three Year Plan, subject to which the Budget Committee would then be asked to approve budgetary appropriations. Even if the Three Year Plan only contained estimates and predictions about projects and contained a measure of uncertainty, a procedure ensuring credibility of WTO activities was called for. His delegation could therefore not accept the procedure to take note of the Three Year Plan as a regular procedure.","WTCOMTDM18.pdf","Switzerland, Committee, on, Trade, and, Development, Committee, Budget, Committee, WTO"
"1204",1204,"36","36.        The Secretariat said that the Guidelines envisaged approval of the Three Year Plan. However, in earlier discussions of the Three Year Plan in the Committee on Trade and Development, several delegations had expressed a preference for taking note rather than approving it, as they felt that an approval of expenditure in the Committee on Trade and Development would imply certain budgetary commitments. Moreover, the Three Year Plan had been turned into a rolling plan. A certain amount of information on what was going to be included in the technical cooperation activities in 1998 was available at the present stage. However, he hoped that many more requests were going to be received, and unfortunately, some requests which had already been made might be taken out for various reasons. The Secretariat therefore felt that the best way to proceed was for the Committee to review the Three Year Plan appropriately revised in successive meetings, although not in every meeting, and take note of it at each stage. This line of procedure seemed to have been confirmed by earlier Committee meetings.","WTCOMTDM18.pdf","Secretariat, Committee, on, Trade, and, Development, Committee, on, Trade, and, Development, Secretariat, Committee, Committee"
"1203",1203,"35","35.

He was aware of the fact that the Budget Committee and the General Council had already approved the budget for 1998. There was thus no point in setting up a procedure at this stage. However, his delegation requested that in subsequent years the Committee have its discussions on this item at an early date for adoption and subsequent submission to the Budget Committee and other relevant Bodies.","WTCOMTDM18.pdf","Switzerland, Committee, on, Trade, and, Development, WTO, General, Council, Budget, Committee, General, Council, Committee, Budget, Committee"

"1201",1201,"33","33.      The Secretariat further said that regarding the allocation of resources to LDCs, the latest budget showed that the allocation to LDCs was SwF 1.9 million out of a total of SwF 4.8 million, which gave a more accurate picture of the activities focused on LDCs. It was not accurate to go by the number of activities since for example two items for LDCs were special training programmes that had been introduced for the LDCs, one for the French-speaking and one for the English-speaking countries. Those programmes were not just two programmes like the other ones as they related to 40 countries. Intensive training would be given to officials from these countries and a considerable amount of the Secretariat's financial and personnel resources would be absorbed by those programmes. Should one still wish to count the activities, the right figure of activities relating to LDCs would amount to 25 out of 94. In response to the question of whether the activities were being truly demand-driven in establishing a three year plan, he recalled that the three year plan was a requirement from the Committee on Trade and Development. In planning the current Three Year Plan, the Secretariat had been guided by the type of requests it received from Members. The specific programmes were established just before the beginning of each year and were almost entirely demand-driven. Demand-driven meant that the Secretariat would not impose a programme on the country concerned. If in a region there was a demand from four to five countries, regional activities would be planned without waiting for a request from all others in that region. The activity would then be proposed and it would be up to each country to participate or not. Demand-driven had to be given a realistic meaning.","WTCOMTDM18.pdf","Secretariat, Secretariat, LDCs, Committee, on, Trade, and, Development, Secretariat, Members, Secretariat"
"1200",1200,"32","32.      The Secretariat said that it would respond to the requests for additional information in the next revision of the document. He said that the sharp expansion of technical cooperation activities affected not only the Technical Cooperation Division, but also the operational divisions. After reviewing the latest plan, a number of operational division directors felt that the set of activities programmed for 1998 went beyond the capacity of the resources available. They had pointed out that the same staff were used for dispute settlement, and that if there were an increase in dispute settlement cases it would not be possible to give all the technical assistance requested. The Secretariat was therefore considering engaging consultants in a limited number of cases where it could be assured that they were able to do the job. He added that in the past six months three of the nine staff members in the Technical Cooperation and Training Division had been locked up in preparing several versions of the Three Year Plan and other work related to documents which had been asked for by the Committee on Trade and Development. The more details delegations asked for, the more time his staff would have to spend on preparing documents instead of being in the field and actually delivering technical assistance. He requested delegations to bear this in mind when requesting greater detail. This applied for example to the request for including financial information. The Secretariat was currently not certain of the venue for various regional activities and the amount spent on each activity depended, among other things, on the venue. Also, exchange rates varied every day and it was therefore difficult to give exact financial requirements for each specific activity. He suggested that delegations contact the Secretariat directly if they wish to have an indication of the financial requirement of a particular project.","WTCOMTDM18.pdf","Secretariat, Technical, Cooperation, Division, Secretariat, Technical, Cooperation, and, Training, Division, Committee, on, Trade, and, Development, Secretariat, Secretariat"
"1199",1199,"31","31.      The representative of Switzerland said that the new document was a clear improvement over the first Three Year Plan. His delegation particularly appreciated the information given in the introductory paragraphs. Paragraph 6 to 13 mentioned, in general terms and in different places, that the Secretariat was put under a lot of pressure from the increased demand for technical assistance. His delegation was of the view that no particular activity should hinder the regular work of the Secretariat. If that should be the case his delegation expected the Secretariat to report such problems to the Committee on Trade and Development or to the relevant body of the WTO. Given the shortage of resources, it might be important to prioritize the activities at some stage. The Secretariat could for example give priority to those activities which corresponded most narrowly to the objectives and principles stated in the Guidelines for Technical Cooperation. Concerning paragraph 13, he noted that several trust-funds were mentioned while in his delegation's understanding there was only one WTO trust-fund for technical cooperation activities which had been established under paragraph b of the Decision of the General Council of 18 July 1996 and which had followed the rules contained in that Decision. Those rules were essential for ensuring transparency and efficiency of WTO technical cooperation activities. With respect to the 1998 activities, he said that it would be useful to explicitly enumerate those activities which related to every section of activities. It would be helpful to relate every particular activity to the section in the main part. For example, section 1.1 on the Agreement on Agriculture, in its third paragraph stated that ""The Annex shows, in particular, two regional seminars on the Agreement on Agriculture..."". It would be useful if these two regional seminars referred to                                                                             WT/COMTD/M/18                                                                             Page 7 would be mentioned by number. With respect to Annex 1 he said that the paper could be improved upon along the lines suggested by other delegations. First, section 4.1(d) of the Implementation Modalities stated that ""...the Three-Year Plan shall indicate for every proposed activity ... (iv) the executing unit and human resource utilisation..."". His delegation suggested that an indication of the human resource utilization be given, as well as the financial implications in a separate column. Another useful improvement would be to have a more detailed description of the project in connection to column two, containing the description and mode of delivery for each activity. This would be particularly appreciated by the sponsoring bodies in capitals in order to determine their priorities.","WTCOMTDM18.pdf","Switzerland, Secretariat, Secretariat, Secretariat, Committee, on, Trade, and, Development, WTO, Secretariat, WTO, General, Council, WTO"
"1198",1198,"30","30.      The representative of Bangladesh said that his delegations comments related to document WT/COMTD/W/32 as his delegation had not had sufficient time to consider Revision 1. of the document. Paragraph 5 of document WT/COMTD/W/32 gave an encouraging picture as it showed a sharp rise in the number of technical cooperation activities undertaken. Four categories of consumers of technical cooperation were identified; LDCs, developing countries, transition economies and acceding countries. His delegation would appreciate receiving information about the distribution of activities among those four categories. Paragraph 7 mentioned increasing trends towards activities at the regional level; in this context his delegation wished to know how much of the available resources went to each region. His delegation urged the Secretariat to give delegations more lead-time in the future to consider documents as delegations needed to consult capitals. Paragraph 16 provided the global objectives and mentioned the priority placed by Members to integrate the LDCs into the multilateral trading system as well as the High-Level Meeting. However, when the activities in Annex 1A were counted, only sixteen of the ninety-two activities related to the High-Level Meeting, a figure that, in his view, did not reflect a very high level of attention to LDCs. Although he did not deny that LDCs were involved in other activities as well, sixteen out of ninety-two was not a very encouraging figure. In 1B, only one activity out of sixteen emanated from the LDC needs. His delegation also felt that information technology was an important issue where more resources should be invested than could be understood from the poor attention it had been given in the document. The document stated that technical cooperation was demand driven. His delegation questioned whether it was really demand-driven when the table already was laid out for three years with times, schedules, venues and subjects already in place. Until the consumers were fully integrated in the preparation of this menu, the claim of demand-driven did not stand on solid ground. However, he realized the difficulties involved and was convinced that at least Geneva-based delegations could be more actively involved. Last, regarding the management of the process, there had been information gaps between missions, capitals and the WTO and his delegation found itself mid-stream between the two, not knowing what either one was doing. He was convinced that it would be possible to find a well-functioning institutional system of communication between these three entities.","WTCOMTDM18.pdf","Bangladesh, Secretariat, Members, LDCs, LDCs, LDC, WTO"
"1197",1197,"3","3.       The representative of Japan said that his delegation did not wish to change the current text of the document but suggested that an addition to the document be made to the effect that an Integrated Framework for Trade-Related Technical Cooperation had been endorsed by the High-Level Meeting on Least-Developed Countries.","WTCOMTDM18.pdf","Japan, Integrated, Framework, for, Trade-Related, Technical, Cooperation"
"1196",1196,"29","29.      The representative of Guatemala said that the document reflected the objectives and the needs for technical cooperation within the WTO while maintaining the flexibility required to face an evolution of needs and to best achieve the objectives. A new format had been put before delegations which facilitated the organization of activities. The increased number of requests for technical cooperation showed the growing interest of developing Members to integrate into the multilateral trading system and constituted a recognition of the benefit that those countries derived from that system. Her government had given priority to integrate its economy into the multilateral trading system and recently decided to strengthen the necessary structures for dealing with the matters within the remit of the WTO. This included the setting up of a mission to the WTO which would become operational in 1998. Within the effort to accelerate the adaptation of Guatemala's policies, rules and regulations to WTO standards technical cooperation was indispensable, including joint inter-organizational cooperation. She hoped WT/COMTD/M/18 Page 6 that her country's efforts would meet with the necessary feed-back so that her country could more effectively contribute to strengthening the multilateral trading system. Her delegation was of the view that the national seminar requested in Annex 1A, item 17 by the government of Guatemala would have a great impact as it would permit her country to define a national programme.","WTCOMTDM18.pdf","Guatemala, WTO, Members, WTO, WTO, Guatemala, WTO, Guatemala"
"1195",1195,"28","28.      The representative of the European Communities welcomed paragraph 13 which gave a detailed idea of the budget situation. She asked the Secretariat whether it would be feasible to add yet another column to the tables in the document which would indicate, in a preliminary way, the cost of the individual programmes mentioned.","WTCOMTDM18.pdf","Secretariat"
"1194",1194,"27","27.      The Chairman highlighted a few items mentioned. First, the flexibility with which the Secretariat responded to needs for technical cooperation. Second, that changes had been made to the document in response to comments by Members on the previous Plan. Third, the format had also been changed as a result of comments by Members. Last, that preliminary rough budget estimates were important. In that respect he had consulted the Secretariat prior to the Meeting and it had become clear that a word about financial implications was called for. Paragraph 13 of document WT/COMTD/W/32/Rev.1 contained preliminary estimates on the basis of rough calculations, as stated therein. These estimates included those related to the agreed follow-up to the High-Level Meeting for the Least-Developed Countries. Whereas the WTO Trust Fund for technical cooperation would have a substantive balance at the end of this year, and a new contribution had been announced at the High-Level Meeting itself, it was clear that the utilization of these funds had to be staggered, as a minimum, over the next two years - 1998 and 1999 - and that not all of them could be exclusively used for the High-Level Meeting follow-up. In that context, the Secretariat's preliminary estimate of the possible shortfall in 1998 for High-Level Meeting follow-up purposes, as mentioned in paragraph 14, was in the order of approximately SwF 1 million. Moreover, the estimates in the Three Year Plan did not include the financial implications of activities that might have to be undertaken in relation to the least-developed countries which had not been the subject of Round Tables during the High-Level Meeting, and where needs assessments and other activities at the national level might be required. He was not suggesting to initiate a debate on that issue at the current Committee on Trade and Development meeting, but only to flag the point to stress the need for consultations, in an appropriate framework, between the Secretariat and the delegations mainly concerned.","WTCOMTDM18.pdf","Chairman, Secretariat, Members, Members, Secretariat, WTO, Secretariat, Committee, on, Trade, and, Development, Secretariat"
"1193",1193,"26","26.      The Secretariat viewed the Three Year Plan as its main programming instrument, which would facilitate both the task of the Secretariat and that of the Committee in relation to technical cooperation activities. It had already proven to be a useful tool in the Secretariat's own internal process for the management of technical cooperation activities. With assistance from Members, the Secretariat would continue to improve it and develop it into its' main programming tool. For these purposes, the Secretariat was in the process of designing an improved data base which would include a mission management system. He expected this data base to be ready in a few months. In that manner, the Secretariat expected to continue providing its Members with the best technical cooperation services possible.","WTCOMTDM18.pdf","Secretariat, Secretariat, Committee, Secretariat, Members, Secretariat, Secretariat, Secretariat, Members"
"1192",1192,"25","25.      The Secretariat continued by saying that the document indicated the broad lines of action for the Secretariat's technical cooperation activities on different WTO subjects for 1998 and 1999 which, for 1998, had been complemented with the detailed list of activities in Annex 1. In response to comments by delegations, Annex 1 had been split into three categories: 1A contained activities fully organized and financed by the WTO; 1B listed activities organized jointly with other organizations, or activities organized by other organizations in which the WTO had a major role; and 1C contained activities to which the WTO had been invited to participate by others. For the year 2000, a brief statement was made, indicating likely future priorities. Many delegations had responded to an invitation by the Secretariat to send in requests for technical cooperation activities by 15 October 1997. It was clear that this target date did not prejudge the presentation of requests at a future time, nor the continuous efforts to respond to them, as was the customary practice. Among the delegations that had responded to the invitation were Bangladesh, Bolivia, Bulgaria, Cyprus, Guatemala, Indonesia, Kazakhstan, Korea, Moldova, Mongolia, Pakistan, Qatar, and regional organizations such as the Forum Secretariat for the Pacific Island Countries and the Commonwealth Secretariat. Where these requests had been precise enough, some concrete activities had been included in Annex 1; in other cases, further consultations with the delegations concerned were needed to define the concrete activities to be undertaken. The                                                                             WT/COMTD/M/18                                                                             Page 5 plan also incorporated programmes being developed with the World Bank and regional development banks such as the Asian Development Bank, the Islamic Development Bank and the Inter-American Development Bank.","WTCOMTDM18.pdf","Secretariat, Secretariat, WTO, WTO, WTO, WTO, Secretariat, Bangladesh, Bolivia, Bulgaria, Cyprus, Guatemala, Indonesia, Kazakhstan, Korea, Moldova, Mongolia, Pakistan, Qatar, Forum, Secretariat, Pacific, Island, Countries, Secretariat, World, Bank, Asian, Development, Bank, Islamic, Development, Bank, Inter-American, Development, Bank"
"1191",1191,"24","24.     The Secretariat further said that some changes had been made in the presentation of the Three Year Plan, both in form and in substance. These changes endeavoured to respond to comments made by Members on the previous plan and to improve the document and the planning process describing the broad framework within which activities were designed and planned. Thus, document WT/COMTD/W/32/Rev.1 contained an introductory section (paragraphs 1 through 17) which illustrated some of the lessons learned through the experience of the previous plan, and described the process of preparation of the document, detailed its structure, provided some preliminary rough budgetary estimates, and summarized, along broad lines, the global objective of the Secretariat's technical cooperation activities. That objective was always evolving.","WTCOMTDM18.pdf","Secretariat, Members, Secretariat"
"1190",1190,"23","23.      The Secretariat introduced the document by saying that it had been prepared pursuant to the Guidelines for Technical Cooperation adopted by the Committee on Trade and Development last year. Revision 1 affected the figures quoted in paragraph 13 and incorporated into Annex 1A a number of new activities as follow-up to the High-Level Meeting and certain revisions on sources of funding. The short time available since the High-Level Meeting had made it possible to circulate document WT/COMTD/W/32/Rev.1 only in english for the meeting. French and spanish versions would be circulated as soon as possible. As Members might recall, the present plan was only the second triennial plan prepared under the Committee's procedures, and the first one that was actually presented to the Committee prior to the initiation of an annual programme. The 1997 - 1999 plan had been presented in May 1997, and an addendum on 1997 activities had been provided to the Committee last August. He mentioned this only to highlight the very dynamic nature of technical cooperation activities and the need for the Secretariat to always be ready to respond in a flexible manner to requests for technical cooperation activities which it received on a continuous basis.","WTCOMTDM18.pdf","Secretariat, Committee, on, Trade, and, Development, Members, Committee, Committee, Committee, Secretariat"

The Secretariat continued by explaining that the Integrated WTO/UNCTAD/ITC Technical Assistance Programme for Selected Least-Developed and Other African Countries was a programme for eight countries out of which four were least-developed and four developing countries. When the Integrated Framework for Trade Related Technical Assistance for the least-developed countries had been drawn up, it had been agreed to subsume the former programme into the latter, but only with respect to the least-developed countries, as there was no use in having two programmes in parallel for the same countries.

While some delegations had mentioned that the document was lengthy and should be shortened and made more reader-friendly, other delegates had mentioned the need for updating, taking into consideration various suggestions that had been made and for maintaining certain sections. It was important to keep in mind the purpose of the Manual and he took it that the document could be adopted, taking into consideration the possibility to update it regularly.","WTCOMTDM18.pdf","Chairman"
"1183",1183,"17","17.    The representative of Morocco said that his delegation had also requested UNCTAD to produce a manual on technical cooperation. There was merit in streamlining the format of the three Manuals.","WTCOMTDM18.pdf","Morocco, UNCTAD"
"1182",1182,"16","16.       The representative of the International Trade Centre (ITC) explained that ITC's objective in producing its manual on technical cooperation had been to produce a short document to explain to its clients and partners what the ITC was all about as distinct from an annual report where ITC reported at length on what had happened throughout the year. The objective had been to spell out in as brief, as clear, and as business-like a manner as possible what ITC's areas of specialization were, how to go about requesting assistance from ITC, how ITC worked with its partners and ITC's own approach to technical assistance.","WTCOMTDM18.pdf","International, Trade, Centre, ITC, ITC, ITC, ITC, ITC, ITC, ITC, ITC"

He suggested that the Manual could have several versions according to its use.

"1180",1180,"14","14.      The representative of Morocco recalled that the purpose of the Manual was to inform officials in capitals about modalities to utilize WTO technical assistance. The Committee on Trade and Development should not try to make any points in it or to reflect the outcome of the High-Level Meeting. The High-Level Meeting was not that important for the purpose of the Manual, other than that it was a historical fact. In that light, most of the comments seemed irrelevant.

As the overall programme of activities was expensive the question arose of available resources to respond to all requests. In follow-up to the High-Level Meeting it was also important to determine whether there was overlap or duplication. Her delegation wished to assure that the preoccupations expressed at the High-Level Meeting were reflected in the document.

He suggested that it was more positive to replace “perhaps” by ""preferably"" in the penultimate line, as that was the approach that was being followed in the context of the design of an integrated framework for the least-developed countries; the rational behind it made sense in this connection too. The second comment was that it might be useful to consider including under sub-section (c) that the WTO would assist in the development of a network of local trainers.","WTCOMTDM17.pdf","European, Communities, WTO, WTO"

In this context, he recalled that the Committee had carried out a major review of the subject last year. Documents WT/COMTD/W/16,                                                                          WT/COMTD/M/17                                                                          Page 13 plus Add.1 and Add.2, and WT/COMTD/W/17 contained this review. In light of his informal consultations, he requested the Secretariat to prepare a document as background for the Committee's discussions on this issue in November. The document would contain an updated review of the application of the special provisions in the Multilateral Trade Agreements and related Ministerial Decisions in favour of developing country Members, in particular least-developed country Members, building on the information contained in documents WT/COMTD/W/16, plus Add.1 and Add.2, and WT/COMTD/W/17 of 1996. He added that following his informal consultations, he understood that some countries might wish to raise in this context the issue of identifying the possible steps for operationalization of those provisions which were of a general nature.","WTCOMTDM17.pdf","Chairman, Committee, Committee, Committee, Committee, Members, Members, Committee, Secretariat, Committee, Members, Members"

The Chairman noted that the General Council would undertake an annual overview of WTO activities at its last meeting of the year, which was scheduled tentatively for 10 December. For the purpose of this overview, the General Council would need a report for 1997 from the Committee on Trade and Development. The form that this report should take had been indicated in the General Council's Decision on reporting procedures in document WT/L/105: it should be brief, factual in nature, and provide an indication of the actions and decisions taken by the Committee during the year. With a view to establishing the Committee's Annual Report for 1997, he suggested that the Committee request the Secretariat to prepare a draft for the Committee's review and adoption at its November meeting. In order for Members to be in a position to have a useful discussion at the November meeting, the Secretariat should be requested to submit its draft to Members well in advance of the next meeting, which was scheduled for 17 November.","WTCOMTDM17.pdf","Chairman, General, Council, WTO, General, Council, Committee, on, Trade, and, Development, General, Council, Committee, Committee, Committee, Secretariat, Committee, Members, Secretariat, Members"

However, his delegation understood that the question of observer status had to be resolved at the level of the General Council and he hoped that this was the only reason for not already granting the Islamic Development Bank observer status.","WTCOMTDM17.pdf","Morocco, Head, Committee, on, Trade, and, Development, Islamic, Development, Bank, Islamic, Development, Bank, Islamic, Development, Bank, General, Council, Islamic, Development, Bank"

The representative of Bangladesh said that his delegation was pleased to support strongly the Islamic Development Bank being granted Observer Status in the WTO Committee on Trade and Development. His delegation was of the opinion that this request deserved urgent and sympathetic consideration by Members of the Committee on Trade and Development on the ground of merit, some of which he wished to mention. Both the Committee on Trade and Development and the Islamic Development Bank shared a common area of work relating to trade and development. The Islamic Development Bank was a multilateral loan-giving financial institution which extended soft term development loans to its members under transparent and competitive rules and conditionalities. Its loans benefited Member countries, some of whom like Bangladesh were least-developed. The Islamic Development Bank financed directly export-enhancing and multilaterally trade increasing activities in its member states and it provided technical assistance of sizeable volume to its members to built capacity in a wide area of trade-related economic actions including for human resource development and trade diversification. In its operational pursuit it has been maintaining productive, informal liaison with a number of multilateral organizations like UNCTAD, UNDP and ITC, and its current membership of 52 cut across Asia, Africa, the Middle East and Central Asia. Most of these member states were also Members of the WTO. Considering the above, his delegation urged the delegations present at that day's session of the Committee on Trade and Development to consider positively the extension of immediate observer status to the Islamic Development Bank. Such a decision by the Committee on Trade and Development would be in its interest and would strengthen multilateral trade.","WTCOMTDM17.pdf","Bangladesh, Islamic, Development, Bank, WTO, Committee, on, Trade, and, Development, Members, Committee, on, Trade, and, Development, Committee, on, Trade, and, Development, Islamic, Development, Bank, Islamic, Development, Bank, Member, Bangladesh, Islamic, Development, Bank, UNCTAD, UNDP, ITC, Asia, Africa, Middle, East, Central, Asia, Members, WTO, Committee, on, Trade, and, Development, Islamic, Development, Bank, Committee, on, Trade, and, Development"

"1151",1151,"63","63.      The representative of Pakistan said that his delegation had hoped that this would be a straightforward case which would meet the agreement of Members. In his delegation's view, the Islamic Development Bank squarely met the criteria laid down by the WTO for acquiring observer status by international intergovernmental organizations. His delegation had a number of reasons for saying so. First, the Islamic Development Bank was a development financing institution with the primary objective of promoting the social and economic development of its member countries. In pursuit of this objective it had focused its activities on trade promotion among its member countries. Moreover, the Islamic Development Bank had a global character as it comprised 52 Members from Africa, Asia, the Middle East, Central Asia and Latin America. The volume of its trade financing was around a billion dollars, and trade financing was a basic instrument of trade promotion. In light of this, his delegation did not see any reason for an objection to the Islamic Development Bank being granted observer status as it met the criteria of being trade related. It was an organization which was directly engaged in promoting international trade. His delegation hoped that Members would judge the request purely on its merits. In the current list of observers there were similar organizations which had already been granted observer status. He questioned why the Islamic Development Bank should get a different treatment.","WTCOMTDM17.pdf","Pakistan, Members, Islamic, Development, Bank, WTO, Islamic, Development, Bank, Islamic, Development, Bank, Members, Africa, Asia, Middle, East, Central, Asia, Latin, America, Islamic, Development, Bank, Members, Islamic, Development, Bank"

The Chairman noted that in a letter dated 20 July 1997 addressed to him in his capacity as Chairman of the Committee on Trade and Development, the President of the Islamic Development Bank had requested observer status in the Committee for Trade and Development. The Chairman said that he had replied that, in line with the procedure for granting observer status to international intergovernmental organizations in WTO bodies, the Islamic Development Bank had been added to the list of international intergovernmental organizations applying for observership status in this Committee. He had placed this request on the agenda of today's meeting in the hope that he might be in a position to propose that the Committee took action on this issue. He regretted that he was                                                                             WT/COMTD/M/17                                                                             Page 11 not in a position to do so.

The representative of the Secretariat said that from conversations it had had with several delegations it felt that there was no need to issue a new budget covering only two delegates per least- developed country. It should be possible to finance the original budget as it stood. Regarding documentation, it was the aim to issue documents as soon as possible. It was the understanding of the Secretariat that it had been asked to produce, at the High-Level Meeting, an integrated response by six agencies to the needs expressed by least-developed countries. The Secretariat did not envisage having to organize extensive roundtables actively involving bilateral donors. Rather it envisaged an exercise of co-ordinating the activities of six agencies with the needs of least-developed countries. There would hopefully be a multiplier effect spreading from the exercise, but there was unfortunately not enough time at the High-Level Meeting itself to broaden the exercise further. Informal consultations would be continuing on various issues related to the High-Level Meeting. The Secretariat's appreciation was that the preparations were proceeding exceedingly well and that the High-Level Meeting would be a success.","WTCOMTDM17.pdf","Secretariat, Secretariat, Secretariat, Secretariat"

Document WT/COMTD/W/29 was dated 25 July, and long consultations had been held on it.

"1146",1146,"59","59.      The representative of Morocco did not share the understanding of Hong Kong, China. His delegation's understanding was that the market access component of the High-Level Meeting would occur before the roundtables and that nothing but practical measures in favour of least-developed countries was to be discussed. As far as systemic issues were concerned, they had been discussed in the preparations of the Plan of Action and the limits of such discussions had become clear at that time. If practical results were wanted from a two-day meeting, no discussions relating to systemic issues or generalities should be entered into as those issues required time. For those reasons, his delegation thought that the understanding was not to have any discussion beyond announcements of practical measures. Bound market access for least-developed countries would have been ideal, but from experience gained at the Singapore Ministerial Conference it was clear that the WTO was not yet ready for that.","WTCOMTDM17.pdf","Morocco, Hong, Kong, China, Singapore, WTO"

The representative of Hong Kong, China asked whether the subject of market access for the products of least-developed countries would be on the agenda before the roundtables or whether market access would only be treated during the roundtables. His delegation hoped that it would be before, as Members should be able, under that Agenda Item, not only to announce autonomous market access offers but also to comment in general terms on the subject of market access for least-developed countries, and the systemic WTO and trade policy developments which might be affecting market access. The Agenda should be flexible enough to accommodate Members who might wish to make comments along this lines.","WTCOMTDM17.pdf","Hong, Kong, China, Members, WTO, Members"

His delegation had no problem with its needs assessment WT/COMTD/M/17 Page 10 being distributed to donors and bilateral partners. He wished to stress the point that had been raised by Tanzania in the Sub-Committee on Least-Developed Countries regarding participation. The least- developed countries would most likely be represented at ministerial level and it was the hope of his delegation that the attendance from other participants would be at a high level too.","WTCOMTDM17.pdf","Uganda, Tanzania"

The representative of Bangladesh thanked the European Communities for the significant announcement of the opening up to non-ACP least-developed countries of market access in terms of the Lomé Convention. If he had understood the representative of the European Communities right, the facilities would be dependent on certain conditions being met in the sense that right domestic reforms and right domestic policies needed to be followed. He hoped that the paper coming from the European Communities in this connection would be specific and lay out the exact initiatives, areas and policies that would be expected of the least-developed countries. It was his delegation's experience that the policy reforms in some least-developed countries had not always been properly understood in the least- developed country context. He therefore asked that the policy papers be simplified, detailed and time- bound and that they state explicitly what the requirements would be. Finally he hoped that other countries would follow the initiative of the European Communities in coming up with improved market access offers in favour of least-developed countries.","WTCOMTDM17.pdf","Bangladesh, European, Communities, European, Communities"

However, these papers were owned by the least- developed countries themselves, and the least-developed countries were free to approach those donors they considered relevant with their needs assessment. There was a difference between what the Secretariats that organized the High-Level Meeting could do and what the least-developed countries themselves, who owned these papers, could do. Some of the information problems could probably be resolved that way. Immediately after the preparatory inter-agency meetings, the Sub-Committee on Least-Developed Countries would hold a meeting where the outcome of the inter-agency deliberations would be reported.","WTCOMTDM17.pdf","Chairperson, Sub-Committee"
"1140",1140,"53","53.      He went on to say that the second element of the European Communities' approach was that an active participation of least-developed countries themselves was expected, including in follow-up of any activity that would be agreed, as well as efforts to put the right domestic policies in place in line with the requirements of the global economy in order to attract foreign direct investment. The third element of the European Communities' approach was technical assistance. Technical assistance would be a central theme of the High-Level Meeting on Least-Developed Countries. His delegation supported the aim to get a more efficient disbursement and delivery of technical assistance. In developed countries there was a need to renew public support for development policies. The best way to do so was to show that development policies could be effective, and that the countries in need also made efforts. Those were the elements of the paper which he hoped would be circulated soon and that had been drafted at the Community level with a view to the High-Level Meeting on Least-Developed Countries.","WTCOMTDM17.pdf",""
"1139",1139,"52","52.     He explained the recent move by the European Communities on market access. The European Communities was by far the largest market for exports from least-developed countries and it already gave generous market access conditions for products from least-developed countries.

On 20 June, the Council of Ministers of the European Union adopted the principle that the least-developed countries which were non-ACP countries be granted market access conditions to the European Communities' market equivalent to those of the Lomé partners. The Council of Ministers of the European Union had also backed a simplification of rules of origin and a possible cumulation of origin for least-developed countries. His delegation also wished to take the opportunity to reiterate a call on all developed and the most advanced among the developing countries to make a contribution to improve access to their markets for products from least-developed countries as well.","WTCOMTDM17.pdf","Council, of, Ministers, of, the, European, Union, Council, of, Ministers, of, the, European, Union"
"1138",1138,"51","51.      The representative of the European Communities said that in order for bilateral donors to play a useful role at the High-Level Meeting they would need to have the needs assessments shortly. It was not realistic to give bilateral donors only from mid-October to consider the needs assessments which had taken the Agencies much longer to consider. It was understandable that no final list of the least-developed countries to be featured at country-specific roundtables at the High-Level Meeting existed. However, there was a need to get the needs assessments as quickly as possible in order for the bilateral community to contribute. Second, a new paper on the budget was also needed in order to examine to what extent gaps could be filled. Third, a better integration of least-developed countries into the world trading system was a priority to which the European Communities was committed and the European Communities intended to circulate a paper on the issue. The paper would include a comprehensive three-prong approach. The first element was more generous market access to the European Communities' market. The second was the importance of economic reform in the least-developed countries themselves in order to help overcome supply-side constraints and in order to attract foreign direct investment. The third element was a more effective use of technical assistance.","WTCOMTDM17.pdf","European, Communities"

She wished to remind the least-developed countries that it was up to them to choose the chairman and the additional institutions and donors to be invited to their particular roundtables. Regarding the thematic roundtables, consultation held in UNCTAD had led to consensus on the themes to be discussed and on the participants in the roundtables. UNCTAD would take care of the organization of the roundtables. The Chairs of the two thematic roundtables might be Minister Pronk of the Netherlands and a least-developed country Minister. UNCTAD was carrying out consultations on those issues. The thematic roundtables would end up in plenary in the form of the documents embodying the recommendations to the inter-governmental institutions, to the governments of the least-developed countries and to the donor community at large. The aim was to endorse those recommendations in the plenary. The aim was also to endorse the paper on the Integrated Framework. It should be recalled that consultations had been held on the issue by Mr. Hoda and Mr. Fortin. They would hold further informal consultations and the document would then be distributed. Finally, a new version of the budget was expected at any moment as there had been a reluctance of donors to pledge on the base of the earlier budget. Partly because of the overheads and partly because three tickets per least-developed country was regarded by some donors as a bit exaggerated. A more modest budget could hopefully attract new commitments and she encouraged those in a position to do so to pledge as only Sweden had committed itself so far. Ambassador Lafer, the Chairman of the General Council was still holding consultations with a view to resolving the political problem of attendance of countries at the High-Level Meeting. Finally, she advised delegations to spend some time at the NGO conference as their contribution to the debate on the issues to be discussed at the High-Level Meeting would be useful.","WTCOMTDM17.pdf","chairman, UNCTAD, UNCTAD, Pronk, Netherlands, UNCTAD, Integrated, Framework, Hoda, Fortin, Sweden, Ambassador, Lafer, Chairman, General, Council"

The representative of Morocco suggested that all documents relating to technical cooperation only be adopted at the Committee's last session of the year in order for delegations to be able to study them more. He found the document in question difficult to adopt. For example, he disliked the use of the term “donor Members” which was a notion that should be avoided.

She said that the opening plenary would provide an opportunity for countries to announce market access initiatives for least- developed countries. She was fairly optimistic, both with regard to announcements to be made by developed and by developing nations in this regard. The meeting would then split into country-specific roundtables and thematic roundtables. As many needs assessments of sufficient quality to conduct roundtables had been received, it would be necessary either to have parallel country-specific roundtables or to attend to some least-developed countries before or after the High-Level Meeting.","WTCOMTDM17.pdf","Chairperson, UNCTAD"

The representative of Uganda said that what clearly came out of the paper was that in spite of progress and deepening of structural reforms in least-developed countries, there was still a need for external assistance if the least-developed countries were to take advantage of the new trading environment. The sources of growth of least-developed countries' trade still were mainly exports of primary commodities and not of value-added manufactured goods.

This showed that it was right for WTO Members to focus on least-developed countries. Two other points made in the paper which were worth underlining were the contribution the advanced developing countries could make in improving access to their markets. That was something all Members should consider in the context of the High-Level Meeting.

Relating to paragraph 20, his delegation did not fully agree with the statement that least- developed countries faced the same market access conditions in developing country markets as other exporters. Technical assistance and technical cooperation programmes provided by developing countries aimed at helping least-developed countries to get greater market access to the market of the developing country providing such assistance.

The Note updated the study which had been prepared by the Secretariat in 1996 of Major Trends and Underlying Factors in the Participation of Developing Countries in World Trade over the past twenty years and was contained in document WT/COMTD/W/15.","WTCOMTDM17.pdf","Chairman, Committee, Secretariat, Members, Secretariat"

"1120",1120,"35","35.     The representative of Colombia had no objection to breaking the information into WTO organized and non-WTO organized activities. However, the document appeared most useful in chronological presentation as it would allow delegations to know what technical assistance seminars were taking place world-wide at a certain point in time. With respect to the question from the European Communities regarding whether any Member had requested technical assistance for 1998, Colombia had requested WTO assistance in organizing a seminar on anti-dumping and safeguards to be held in Colombia in 1998.","WTCOMTDM17.pdf","Colombia, WTO, non-WTO, European, Communities, Member, Colombia, WTO, Colombia"

The representative of Myanmar, speaking on behalf of ASEAN, agreed with the representative of Morocco that a separation of the activities initiated and organized by the Secretariat from those of other agencies would give a clearer picture.","WTCOMTDM17.pdf","Myanmar, ASEAN, Morocco, Secretariat"
"1118",1118,"33","33.      The representative of Egypt noted that the Three Year plan for Technical Cooperation had solicited many questions from officials in his capital. He was of view that the intention of the paper had been to solicit requests and actions. He supported that flexibility be maintained in the work plan for the two future years as it helped the planning of requests from capitals.","WTCOMTDM17.pdf","Egypt"
"1117",1117,"32","32.     The representative of Morocco said that as his delegation did not believe that the same amount of work was involved no matter whether the activity was initiated and organized by the WTO Secretariat or by some other organization, his delegation wished to see technical cooperation activities organized WT/COMTD/M/17 Page 6 by other organizations accredited as such. He felt that it was fundamental that the WTO technical assistance be judged by the activities in which the WTO had the main responsibility.","WTCOMTDM17.pdf","Morocco, WTO, Secretariat, WTO, WTO"
"1116",1116,"31","31.      The representative of the Secretariat replied that the document could be presented the way Members found most convenient. However, he wished to draw the attention to the first page of Addendum 1 where it was stated that the attached table contained an updated version of the programme of technical cooperation activities for 1997. It was distributed as an Addendum, and it was stated that it substituted pages 5-18 of the original document. Secondly, the Secretariat could segregate the WTO organized technical activities from those organized by others if the Committee so wished. In the current document, all the activities in which the Secretariat had participated in a year had been presented in alphabetical and chronological order. It was of course possible to segregate the activities into two groups, but as far as the Secretariat was concerned, the same amount of work was involved no matter whether the activity was initiated and organized by the Secretariat or by some other agency.","WTCOMTDM17.pdf","Secretariat, Members, Secretariat, WTO, Committee, Secretariat, Secretariat, Secretariat"
"1115",1115,"30","30.      The representative of Morocco asked why the document had been provided as an Addendum and not as a revised document. He suggested that working documents be used in the future, and that document symbols only be given to adopted documents. Regarding the presentation, he suggested that an additional column be created which would separate WTO technical cooperation activities from those of other organizations. For those activities in which WTO involvement was limited to the participation of WTO experts at a meeting, no cost should be mentioned. It was enough to state that “WTO participated by sending experts”. It would thus be easier to identify the activities which were primarily initiated by the WTO.","WTCOMTDM17.pdf","Morocco, WTO, WTO, WTO, WTO, WTO"
"1114",1114,"3","3.      The Chairman noted that the Secretariat had prepared a note, in document WT/COMTD/W/29, dated 25 July, for consideration by the Committee. As mentioned in the document, the draft attempted to capture elements of the Secretariat's non-paper of February 1997, the informal note by the Swiss WT/COMTD/M/17 Page 2 delegation circulated in May, and various comments made by delegations. He recalled that at the Committee's May meeting, a further period of two weeks had been provided so as to give the opportunity to Members to comment in writing. He believed that the note presented by the Secretariat achieved a careful balance among often diverging views. He therefore hoped that the Committee would be in a position to adopt finally these Implementation Modalities.","WTCOMTDM17.pdf","Chairman, Secretariat, Committee, Secretariat, Committee, Members, Secretariat, Committee"
"1113",1113,"29","29.     The representative of Switzerland noted that the Three-Year Plan showed the tremendous need to coordinate technical assistance among the international organizations. The current Three-Year Plan was a good start, and it would subsequently need to be even further improved.","WTCOMTDM17.pdf","Switzerland"
"1112",1112,"28","28.      The Secretariat said that the original idea for the Three-Year Plan for Technical Cooperation was that detailed information be given about the plan and the requests for the current year, but that for the subsequent two years only an indication of the types of areas that would be attended to was to be given. As it was difficult to get countries to focus and plan ahead regarding the type of technical assistance they were likely to request, it was hard to give specific information beyond a three-month period. The final response would, for most cases, only be available just prior to the event to be held. Even in the specific annual plan for the current year, many changes took place. Therefore, only a rough idea as to the activities of the two years furthest in the future of each Three-Year Plan could be given. Another Three-Year Plan would be presented to the Committee at its next meeting in which activities for 1998 would be described in greater detail and a rough idea would be provided of the activities planned for 1999-2000.","WTCOMTDM17.pdf","Secretariat, Committee"
"1111",1111,"27","27.     The representative of the European Communities said that the original document did not contain any specific activities for 1998 either. The document only mentioned areas of focus, which was not the same as requests for action. He was of the view that information about specific requests for activities in 1998 was still lacking.","WTCOMTDM17.pdf","European, Communities"
"1110",1110,"26","26.     The Secretariat noted that there had certainly been requests for technical cooperation for 1998. He added that the document was an addendum to the previous document, and as such it did not revise the Secretariat's projected activities in 1998 and 1999, nor did it revise the introductory note.","WTCOMTDM17.pdf","Secretariat, Secretariat"
"1109",1109,"25","25.    The representative of the European Communities said that the document should be monitored and updated in a regular fashion. He asked for clarification on why only activities for 1997 were                                                                             WT/COMTD/M/17                                                                             Page 5 presented in detail, when this was a Three-Year Plan. There was little information on activities for the following two years, and he asked whether that indicated that no specific requests for activities next year and beyond had been submitted?","WTCOMTDM17.pdf","European, Communities"
"1108",1108,"24","24.      The representative of Morocco agreed with the suggestions made. His only comment related to the presentation. He wished to see a separate table for activities which the WTO had initiated so as to distinguish them from those activities in which WTO had only participated. It would give a clearer idea of the volume of WTO organized events.","WTCOMTDM17.pdf","Morocco, WTO, WTO, WTO"
"1107",1107,"23","23.      The Chairman said that the Secretariat had circulated, in document WT/COMTD/W/25/Add.1, an updated version of the Technical Assistance Programme of Activities for 1997. Following suggestions made at the last meeting, the Secretariat had improved on the paper and had introduced two new columns, one called ""WTO Funding"" and one called ""Other Funding"", thus separating the sources of funding from the column which indicated the organizing entity. Members would appreciate that the document showed an intensification of activities, which underlined the fact that demand-driven assistance by necessity led to frequent changes and in most cases additions to original plans. For example, the preparation of the High-Level Meeting and needs assessment missions undertaken in that connection had led to additional technical assistance for the least-developed countries beyond what was reflected in the original document. Since much of the first year of the 1997-1999 plan had lapsed, he suggested that the Committee took note of it at this point. He added that as provided for in the Guidelines and the Implementation Modalities, the Secretariat would provide the Committee with a Draft Three-Year Plan covering 1998-2000 for the next meeting.","WTCOMTDM17.pdf","Chairman, Secretariat, Secretariat, Members, Committee, Secretariat, Committee"

"1104",1104,"20","20.      The representative of Switzerland said that the document could only be finalized after the High- Level Meeting had taken place as the Meeting might influence its drafting. He suggested that the phrasing on Page 21 which stated that “The grants provided by the Members can be administered by the WTO Secretariat or the donor, and are mostly earmarked for specific activities decided upon between the donor and the WTO Secretariat and to be carried out within a certain time-frame"" be changed to state that specific activities should be decided according to the guidelines and implementation modalities as they constituted the framework within which the Committee worked. There was also a need to mention the decision of the General Council on the issue of the Trust Fund for the High-Level Meeting, and in that context that consultations on the matter of the 13 per cent overhead had been held.","WTCOMTDM17.pdf","Switzerland, Members, WTO, Secretariat, WTO, Secretariat, Committee, General, Council"

"1102",1102,"19","19.      The representative of the European Communities thought that the Manual would be useful for countries seeking technical assistance. Concerning the section on cooperation with other international organizations on Page 20, much more could be said in light of the High-Level Meeting on Least- Developed Countries' Trade Development, and it would be necessary to update the information after that Meeting. Regarding the reference to the establishment of the Subcommittee on Least-Developed Countries on Pages 4 and 5, he believed that the date was 1995, rather than 1996. Concerning the title, ""Increased need for technical assistance for developing countries” he suggested it be changed to “Increased need for technical assistance” as it also covered technical assistance for acceding countries which were not all necessarily regarded as developing countries by all Members.","WTCOMTDM17.pdf","Trade, Development, Members"

He referred to the first section on page 7 which stated, in the second paragraph, that for beneficiaries ""for seminars, workshops, training activities and other specialized activities to be carried out in Geneva, the selection criteria will mostly be established by the WTO Secretariat"" and said that his delegation did not have a problem with this wording as long as the final selection and nomination of government officials would be left to the governments. Likewise, regarding the paragraph referring to private sector attendance, he suggested that it be clarified that these representatives would be invited by the governments concerned. Referring to the paragraph which dealt with acceding countries on Page 8 he proposed that, as had been done on Page 4 in the paragraph dealing with WT/COMTD/M/17 Page 4 developing countries, it would be better to cite the number of developing countries in the process of accession.","WTCOMTDM17.pdf","Pakistan, Geneva, WTO, Secretariat"

He agreed with the Chair in that the document needed to be made public. It was necessary that the people in the different ministries in capitals and others who were to benefit from the WTO technical cooperation activities had access to it.

The representative of India referred to the suggestion made by the representative of the United States regarding the self-selection of developing countries and said that his delegation needed to see the language and wished to think about it. His delegation also had problems with the word ""integration"" on Page 6 when it referred to the ""full integration of beneficiaries into the multilateral trading system"".

"1098",1098,"15","15.     The representative of Morocco said that although he saw the usefulness of having a document such as the Manual ready for the High-Level Meeting on Least-Developed Countries' Trade Development, his delegation preferred that the document be presented then as a provisional document to Ministers and delegates. For one, he found it too long, despite attempts to reduce it. He suggested that some parts could be included in the Annual Report of the Committee and that some details could be taken out. As it was his delegation which had asked for the document, he wished to inform the Committee that his delegation was making an effort to ask UNCTAD and ITC for the same type of documents. The idea was that the three documents would be compatible and comparable so as to enable delegations to better understand the technical cooperation activities of each organization.","WTCOMTDM17.pdf","Morocco, Committee, Committee, UNCTAD, ITC"

Delegations had been invited to submit comments in writing within two weeks of that meeting. The paper had been shortened and the Secretariat had attempted to take on board comments made. The Manual provided a description of the technical cooperation and training activities available in the WTO and explained how Members should go about obtaining such assistance. He suggested that the Committee agree to the text, while at the same time asking the Secretariat to make any necessary adjustments in the light of the High-Level Meeting, and proceed to have the paper derestricted as soon as possible so that the Manual, which was not a legal document, could finally reach the public.","WTCOMTDM17.pdf","Chairman, Committee, Secretariat, WTO, Members, Committee, Secretariat"

It provided a good snapshot of the technical cooperation activities and the finances involved. His government had contributed to technical assistance programmes for countries in transition, with a view to making WTO as universal as possible.

On the basis of the General Council guidelines for observer status for intergovernmental organisations, he had conducted further informal consultations, and he was now in a position to propose to this Committee that it extend observer status to the African, Caribbean and Pacific Group of States (ACP) and Southern African Development Community (SADC). As regards other intergovernmental organizations, his informal consultations were continuing.

Nevertheless, pursuant to the CRTA's terms of reference, that Committee dealt with all regional trading agreements, including those which would be notified under the Enabling Clause. Discussion under the Enabling Clause would of course remain in the CTD but the understanding of the TORs of the CRTA was such that information on regional trading arrangements notified under the Enabling Clause should be provided to it. Inevitably, there would be an issue raised by some of such arrangements which would require examination under the provisions of Article XXIV.

He understood the constraints which confronted the Secretariat to draw up a detailed Plan, and as such, his delegation considered it an instrument which could be improved. His delegations had made suggestions concerning the implementation modalities. He would welcome more detailed information on the budgetary elements, both as far as the financial aspect was concerned and the allocation of resources. While in view of the tight deadlines his delegation was prepared to accept the document, it was understood that it was not the final form of the Three-Year Plan, which his delegation considered a fundamental tool for technical cooperation by this organization.","WTCOMTDM16.pdf","Switzerland, Secretariat"

The review meeting planned for 26 June would provide an occasion for the Secretariat to provide delegations the necessary information, with a view to discussing it at that meeting in the light of information provided by the other participating agencies.

His authorities were confident and indeed had received signals that key players in global trading system would actively participate in the High-Level Meeting. His delegation was pleased that the Trust fund had been set up, and hoped that contributions from donors would be generous. The need for consultants for LDCs' preparations of needs assessments was well recognized and he was confident that the selection would be made in appropriate consultation with the beneficiary countries, or at least be tuned to their requirements. A format for NGO participation also needed to be worked out, which would ensure that NGOs not be so de-linked from the main event so as not to be able to benefit from or contribute to the High-Level Meeting. The universality in the global trading system could not be achieved without the least-developed countries. The High-Level Meeting was an opportunity to reverse the course of marginalization. It would help make the trading régime truly global and his delegation was confident to see some new approaches to this at the Meeting. It would also enable a more thorough integration of technical assistance activities among the various agencies in order to make the impact more results oriented. He welcomed the increased cooperation between not only WTO, UNCTAD and ITC but also between these bodies and the Bretton Woods institutions. The least-developed countries were hoping that increased market access for their products as well as expanded investments flows would be among the result of the High-Level Meeting. In this regard, they were also looking to the success of the pilot seminar, organized in June, by UNCTAD. He wondered if there would not be scope for an effective association in the preparatory process of the High-Level Meeting with UNIDO. The Denver Summit of the G-7 would no doubt have an important impact of the Meeting. To that end, the Prime Minister of his country had addressed a letter on behalf of the LDCs to the leaders of the G7 countries, with the objective to sensitise them as to LDCs' expectations and aspirations. He had information indicating that some leaders had already reacted with favourable action. The WTO had emerged over the past three years as an important player in the global trade field. The Committee and Trade and Development and its Sub-Committee on Least- developed Countries had a role in injecting a development orientation in WTO's goal and purposes, which was crucial for all developing countries in general and the LDCs in particular. This would also assist in generating the desired kind of political commitment to the WTO. The Committee on Trade and Development would therefore also need to have a significant role in the preparations of WTO's next Ministerial Meeting next year.","WTCOMTDM16.pdf","Bangladesh, Director-General, WTO, UNCTAD, ITC, UNCTAD, UNIDO, G-7, LDCs, WTO, Committee, and, Trade, and, Development, WTO, LDCs, WTO, Committee, on, Trade, and, Development, WTO"

"1069",1069,"56","56.      The Chairperson of the Sub-Committee, Ambassador Herfkens, recalled that the Sub-Committee, at its meeting on 18 April, had agreed on the dates of the High-Level Meeting (27-28 October 1997), on the basic format of the Meeting, which would include Roundtable discussions, both on countries and on issues, on the need to avoid, if possible, a plenary session, and that the Meeting would be a common exercise with UNCTAD, ITC, UNDP and the Bretton Woods Institutions. In that context the Committee had cautioned that the exercise should not be micro-managed by one institution alone and had decided to organize a joint meeting involving the Geneva-based institutions on 26 June to review the preparatory process. The informal consultations on the agenda for this June meeting should be seen in this light. The Director-General of the WTO had sent letters to all 48 least-developed countries, spelling out the approach of the High-Level Meeting, and transmitting a checklist to assist the least developed countries in their determination of their needs for trade-related technical assistance. She recalled that the selection of the least-developed countries which would be ""featured"" at the High-Level Meeting itself in the Round tables would be done on the basis of their needs assessment. The checklist, which had been established in a common effort by all six participating institutions, also provided for the possibility to request technical assistance to help the LDCs in completing the checklist. Furthermore, background documents were being drafted by the participating institutions, in particular inventories of each of the institutions' trade-related technical assistance projects to the least-developed countries, a paper on the market-access conditions facing the exports of individual LDCs and a paper on the relevant use of information technology. Drafts of these papers would be discussed at the next inter-agency meeting on 29 May at which she intended to be present. She also recalled that, at the Sub-Committees' April meeting, she had announced the establishment of a trust fund (document WT/COMTD/LLDC/W/6, dated 1 May refers) and invited delegations to become donors to the trust fund. She also said that, before the meeting of the IMF/World Bank Development Committee in Washington, the Group of 24, which was the Group of 77 for the Bretton Woods institutions, had been discussing the High-Level Meeting, which had prompted telephone calls and letters to her from, in particular, Sub-Sahara African countries, which were not all least-developed. This had inspired her to hope that the High-Level Meeting would lead to other initiatives, covering a wider range of developing countries, which would be WT/COMTD/M/16 Page 10 benefitting from a similar type of exercise. She was encouraged by such signs of interest and commitment to the process on the part of the beneficiaries, given that any such initiative could only be successful, if really demand-driven.","WTCOMTDM16.pdf","Chairperson, Ambassador, Herfkens, UNCTAD, ITC, UNDP, Committee, Director-General, WTO, LDCs, IMF/World, Bank, Development, Committee, Washington, Group, Bretton, Woods"

At this meeting, he would welcome a progress report from the Sub-Committee's Chair on the preparations for the High-Level Meeting and suggested that the Sub-Committee deal with any matter relating to the High-Level Meeting, to avoid taking up the work of the Sub-Committee in this Committee, including the agenda of the joint UNCTAD/WTO June meeting.","WTCOMTDM16.pdf","Morocco, Committee"

The Chairman said that this item had been placed on the agenda of the Committee's meeting in order that delegations be kept abreast of preparations for the High-Level Meeting on Least-Developed Countries and that this meeting seemed a timely occasion to do so. In this context, he recalled that the Committee on Trade and Development, at its meeting on 17 February had requested the Sub- Committee to follow up on the preparations initiated by the Committee on Trade and Development, under the usual guidance of the Committee itself. The Sub-Committee had accordingly taken up the matter under the leadership of its Chairperson, Ambassador Eveline Herfkens of the Netherlands. He placed on record his high regard and appreciation for the way in which she had launched the process and the energy she had brought to the task. He recalled that at its meeting on 18 April, the Sub- Committee on Least-Developed Countries had decided on the dates for the High-Level Meeting and that a review meeting be held jointly with UNCTAD at the end of June to carry forward the preparations for the High-Level Meeting. The date for this review meeting had been set for 26 June. Informal consultations would need to be held over the next couple of weeks to establish the agenda for the June meeting. The Secretariat had informed him that preparations for the High-Level Meeting were progressing well.","WTCOMTDM16.pdf","Chairman, Committee, Committee, on, Trade, and, Development, Sub, -, Committee, Committee, on, Trade, and, Development, Committee, Chairperson, Ambassador, Eveline, Herfkens, Netherlands, Sub, -, Committee, on, Least-Developed, Countries, UNCTAD, Secretariat"

While agreement was reached on the Committee's work programme for the first half of the year, at least one delegation had said that it was not in a position to take a definite view at that time on a proposal that in the second half of the year the Committee undertake a review of the participation of developing countries in world trade. Would the Committee now be in a position to agree to place on its agenda at its September meeting an item entitled ""Review of the participation of developing countries in world trade"", and if so what guidance did they wish to give to the Secretariat in preparing background documentation to assist our discussions under this item? Referring to some statements made at the Committee's last meeting, he further suggested that before the Committee prepare its report to the General Council at the end of the year, an opportunity be given at the Committee's meeting in the autumn for delegations to comment on any aspect of another item in the Terms of Reference(TORs) of the CTD, in particular ""Review of the Application of Special Provisions in the Multilateral Trade Agreements and Related Ministerial Decisions in Favour of Developing Country Members, in Particular Least-Developed Country Members"", which might warrant delegations' attention. While delegations should not lose sight of this important item on the agenda, the Committee carried out a major review of the subject last year and he felt there was no need to repeat that exercise again until some more time has passed.","WTCOMTDM16.pdf","Chairman, Committee, Work, Programme, Committee, Committee, Committee, Secretariat, Committee, Committee, General, Council, Committee, CTD, Members, Members, Committee"

It was desirable to maintain a consistent effort in this area. Members' long-term commitments would reinforce WTO processes, both on the part of donors and of the recipients, who would be making adjustments to their bureaucracies to adjust to their obligations under the WTO Agreements.

"1057",1057,"45","45.     The representative of Morocco said that his delegation agreed with the Swiss views that a balance should be struck between flexibility and rigidity. Flexibility could only be achieved if based on specific points of reference, in the form of detailed rules of the sort suggested by the Swiss delegation. Implementation of such rules could be done in a more or less flexible manner, depending on the requirements of the beneficiary government. He was of the view that even more details were required that those set out in the Swiss paper. Since the WTO was innovating in this area, strict rules of the game needed to be drafted, with a view to creating a certain tradition. WT/COMTD/M/16 Page 8","WTCOMTDM16.pdf","Morocco, WTO"

The representative of Canada welcomed the Swiss clarifications and cautioned not to introduce too much rigidity in the planning process, in particular with reference to some of the suggestions under paragraph 4.1. Such rigidity would hamper a certain degree of flexibility deemed desirable, which his delegation hoped was not its intended purpose. As regards the monitoring and follow-up exercise, which was useful, he suggested to set out from the beginning the expected outcomes of the programmes, by way of introducing some kind of benchmark against which to evaluate the programmes. His delegation considered the paper overall a useful framework and emphasised the need to ensure that the Secretariat would not spent too much time drawing up plans and reporting on them but rather implement them as faithfully as possible.","WTCOMTDM16.pdf","Canada, Secretariat"

With reference to paragraph 5(b), the Secretariat would attempt a rewording. The paragraph meant to indicate that there would be programs, not on a one-off basis, but ensuring a continuity in the delivery of technical assistance activities, in particular in the case of the least-developed countries. The paragraph also intended to refer to improved electronic assistance, which was envisaged in due course and which would allow WTO to respond more promptly to requests for information and have an efficient two-way exchange. The Web site which was currently being developed in the WTO with its question and answer facility served as an example.","WTCOMTDM16.pdf","Secretariat, Secretariat, WTO, WTO"
"1052",1052,"40","40.     The representative of Switzerland drew the attention of the Committee to a number of points in the proposal. First, it suggested some additional elements with respect to the presentation of the Three-Year Plan. It should be detailed for the first year, and there should be a description of each program including the mode of delivery chosen, and its implications on financial and human resources as well as the source of funding. Interesting ideas had been voiced during the discussion and his delegation was open to take on board comments made by the representatives of the European Communities and Morocco to classify the different activities of technical cooperation according to themes and according to the share taken on by the WTO in the implementation of the activities it carried                                                                              WT/COMTD/M/16                                                                              Page 7 out jointly with other organizations. His delegation would modify its proposal according to these and other comments made during the discussion. As regards the ""urgent requests"" referred to in paragraph 4.1(e) of the draft, it was the view of his delegation that these, during the first year, should only be taken into consideration if they were well founded. However, flexibility was needed and the wording ""bearing in mind the regular program"" left a certain room of manoeuvre for the Secretariat to interpret whether a given request should be followed up or not. He asked a clarification of the last part of the sentence in paragraph 5(b) of the Secretariat's note which read “... should include a sufficient flow of information and a permanent availability of technical expertise and advise”. It was the notion of ""a permanent availability of technical expertise and advise” which was not fully clear to his delegation.","WTCOMTDM16.pdf","Switzerland, Committee, Morocco, WTO, Secretariat, Secretariat"

Her delegation realised that it was mainly an indicative document. She suggested that it be updated, perhaps twice a year and to list the activities which had been confirmed as well as follow-up given. Some budget aspects needed to be clarified since it was not clear to her delegation what was meant by ""projects at no cost to WTO"".","WTCOMTDM16.pdf","European, Communities, WTO"
"1050",1050,"39","39.      The representative of Switzerland thanked the representative of Djibouti for his positive impression of the modest Swiss contribution to the trade policy seminar organized by the WTO. Turning to the implementation modalities, he said that the his authorities' ideas were set out in a paper based on the Secretariat paper of 3 February 1997. The Swiss proposal reproduced that paper, but with suggested changes appearing in bold print. His delegation had tried to take on board comments made by Members as well as those made by the Secretariat. The major change was a simplification. It had first been suggested to present the Three-Year Plan in two stages. The first stage would include a draft on which Members would comment and donors could then have picked projects they wished to sponsor. During the second stage, the Committee would have accepted the draft. The Swiss proposal narrowed the procedure down to one stage. The first aim of the Swiss contribution was to ensure that technical assistance delivered by the WTO Secretariat was in line with the priorities and the objectives established by the Members. Second, that the WTO technical assistance was delivered in a transparent way so as to enable Members to follow developments and, if necessary, to contribute by giving orientation. His delegation hoped that with the modalities proposed, the Committee would manage to draw on the expertise of the WTO Secretariat.","WTCOMTDM16.pdf","Switzerland, Djibouti, WTO, Secretariat, Members, Secretariat, Members, Committee, WTO, Secretariat, Members, WTO, Members, Committee, WTO, Secretariat"

"1040",1040,"3","3.       The representative of the Secretariat drew attention to a number of examples of technical assistance. First, technical assistance regarded all the operational Divisions of WTO. The Three-Year Plan (the Plan) envisaged certain events which were not the sole constituents of technical cooperation activities. Technical cooperation activities were carried out by the Secretariat every day, with delegations, seeking advice on various problems. The work had increased after the establishment of the WTO, because implementation counselling was needed by delegations. He drew attention to thee examples of this counselling. In the Rules Division, delegations would bring in their proposed legislation for advice. These consultations were not reflected in the Three-Year Plan. Regarding the tariff schedules, technical assistance was being provided concerning the revision of the harmonized system or on issues of renegotiation pursuant to modification or withdrawal of concessions, which was done by WTO's Market Access Division. The Understanding on Rules and Procedures Governing the Settlement of Disputes required that the Secretariat provide technical assistance to developing countries in case of a dispute, which was usually done by the Legal Division. These were important illustration of the amount of work which was being carried out by the various Divisions by way of technical assistance, which were not reflected in the Three-Year Plan. He suggested that delegations take account of the vast area of technical assistance being provided which was not contained in the Three-Year Plan, when approving the Plan, which only dealt with seminars and workshops, mostly in the capitals. Second, one of the objective of the technical cooperation activities was to build a long-lasting and effective program for WTO Members. Specially in relation to least-developed countries, programs were conducted and repeated after intervals with a view to building and maintaining awareness of WTO framework. Third, the Secretariat needed the necessary flexibility in the implementation of its projects. WT/COMTD/M/16 Page 2 Since many actors were involved, there was always a risk of changes in timing and in participation, which needed to be accommodated.","WTCOMTDM16.pdf","Secretariat, WTO, Secretariat, WTO, WTO, Secretariat, WTO, Members, WTO, Secretariat"

His delegation agreed with the views expressed by the representative of Morocco that the presentation should be as short as possible in order to enable a broader audience to get a better understanding of the WTO technical cooperation activities. Nonetheless, he suggested to insert, on page 22, a reference to the open trust fund which had just been created as well as an indication of the relatively small amount available for technical cooperation through the regular budget.","WTCOMTDM16.pdf","Norway, WTO, Morocco, WTO"
"1038",1038,"28","28.      The representative of Switzerland said that the Manual was an evolving document which should take into consideration the results of the Committee's discussion on modalities and on the different types of technical cooperation activities managed by WTO. He wondered wether the Manual would be available on the Internet or through other information technology channels. Electronic dissemination would be an advantage, as it would ensure the possibility to constantly update the Manual. It would be useful if the results of High-Level Meeting on Least-Developed Countries be incorporated into the final version of the document, as these might have an impact on the Secretariat's technical cooperation activities. Regarding the issue of funding, on page 22 of the Manual, he recalled that on 18 July 1996, the General Council had set up a trust fund to collect voluntary contributions for the WTO technical cooperation activities. The relevant Decision stipulated that activities to be financed by the fund had to be in conformity with the priorities indicated in the Guidelines established for WTO technical assistance.

The Manual provided a description of the technical cooperation and training activities available in the WTO, explained how Members could benefit from such assistance and how requests should be filed to participate in the activities. Since implementation modalities had not been adopted, they had not yet been fully incorporated into the text.

The representative of the Secretariat said that the Secretariat would circulate an update as soon as possible, in any case before the next meeting of the Committee on Trade and Development (CTD), which was only planned for 26 September, when the bulk of the 1997 would already have been spent, and would therefore not be timely. Turning to some of the questions, he said that quality control, although important, was not appropriately addressed in the Plan, which was an inventory of activities. He drew attention to project number 148, which envisaged use of new technologies. Cost to the Secretariat in those items where ""no cost to Secretariat"" was indicated, meant that the WTO budget was not involved. Listing only those events which were solely organized by the WTO would shorten the Plan considerably, as many events were organized in collaboration with others. For example, events relating to customs evaluation, tariffs, HS system, etc. were done in collaboration with other agencies.  Certain events on investment were done in collaboration with UNCTAD, and those relating to intellectual property rights with WIPO.","WTCOMTDM16.pdf","Secretariat, Secretariat, Committee, on, Trade, and, Development, Secretariat, Secretariat, WTO, WTO, UNCTAD, WIPO"

"1023",1023,"14","14.      The representative of Trinidad and Tobago expressed the need for a revision of the document, since there were still some areas of confusion. He noted instances where the paper referred to activities by the Secretariat where no funding by the WTO was provided, and where the main thrust of the execution was with another organization, in particular World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO).  He noted certain areas, in the section on comments, where activities were subject to approval by the funding government and he wondered what would happen if approval was not granted. The question arose because it was not clear to his delegation what the basis was for funding from the regular budget as opposed to voluntary funds. In referring to number 146 in the Plan, (consultation on accession of the Russian Federation) he wondered what was meant by technical assistance. He did not consider such consultations with an acceding government and resulting travel by the Secretariat staff as technical cooperation in the strictest sense. He hoped that this be clarified in the revised paper. The document should reflect the existence of the Latin American and Caribbean Group. He wondered whether the document could reflect the steps which the Secretariat took to ensure quality control in technical assistance activities. When planning technical assistance activities on a three-year basis, basic reference and basic training materials were needed, which could have some permanence in the process of delivery of technical cooperation, over the wide membership of the WTO in the three-year plan period. He did not see any reference in the document to the creation of such training material. He wondered whether the use of information technology for distance learning and training would enable the funds available to the Secretariat to be more effectively utilized. There was a case to be made for the use of information technology to enable delivery of technical assistance to reach wider audiences at lower costs.","WTCOMTDM16.pdf","Trinidad, and, Tobago, Secretariat, WTO, World, Intellectual, Property, Organization, WIPO, Russian, Federation, Secretariat, Caribbean, Group, Secretariat, WTO, Secretariat"

It would be a constant source of reference for beneficiaries of technical cooperation, for identification of areas where such technical cooperation could be most usefully effected and, as the delegations of United States and Canada had pointed out, it would also be a useful source of data for the High-Level Meeting which could be replicated by other bodies as well.

"1016",1016,"9","9.       The representative of Switzerland presented proposals concerning the implementation modalities of WTO technical cooperation. He referred to the Secretariat's non-paper on implementation modalities, dated 3 February 1997. He cited Section 2, Paragraph A, and welcomed the idea that an official or an office be designated as the central point for interaction with the WTO, and suggested that it also serve the same purpose for all trade-related technical cooperation activities. Concerning Section 2, Paragraph B, he suggested that the selection of participants should also be done according to objective criteria to be defined by the Technical Cooperation and Training Division (the TCTD henceforth) of the Secretariat, and should include qualifications, experience, activities in the WTO relevant field, etc. Concerning Section 3, Paragraph C, he referred to the statement that the TCTD ""...shall, within the areas of competence and expertise of the WTO, develop, execute and participate in inter-agency programmes"" and asked wether the verbs “develop” and “execute” meant that it would become responsible for the elaboration and administration of inter-agency programmes. If so, he wondered if the Secretariat had the necessary experience and human resources to carry out such functions. Concerning Section 4, he recalled that the WTO Council had decided that extra-budgetary contributions for technical cooperation should be transferred into a Trust Fund, while such activities should follow the Guidelines for Technical Cooperation, and that the budgetary proposal should contain an estimate of work hours allocated by each WTO division. Since the Three-Year Plan would be the principal instrument to manage technical cooperation, he suggested that it be carried out in two stages. First, the TCTD should submit a draft Three-Year Plan no later than 1 September in the year preceding the projects proposed to ensure that they be consistent with the Guidelines for Technical Cooperation. They should contain descriptions and estimated costs, in addition to proposed funding for projects. The Budget Committee would then decide on the share of the regular WTO budget to be allocated, taking into account voluntary contributions to the Trust Fund. The Trust Fund should be composed of two windows, with one ear-marked for particular projects and one non-ear-marked. The non-ear- marked window could be used to finance any project from the Three-Year Plan. Contributions to the Trust Fund should be accepted only for projects which appeared on the Draft Three-Year Plan. In the second stage, the TCTD would propose a revised Three-Year Plan which would indicate the modes of delivery of every program, including the implications in terms of resources and the funding arrangements. The CTD would then adopt the finalized Three-Year Plan, if possible before the end of each year. Finally, he noted that his delegation would submit its proposals in writing, incorporating any suggestions from delegations.","WTCOMTDM15.pdf","Switzerland, WTO, Secretariat, WTO, Technical, Cooperation, and, Training, Division, Secretariat, WTO, WTO, Secretariat, WTO, Council, WTO, Budget, Committee, WTO, Trust, Fund, Trust, Fund, CTD"

The Chairman recalled that the Secretariat had circulated general information about technical cooperation activities of the WTO in 1996 are contained in documents WTO/COMTD/W/14 plus Addendum 1, WT/COMTD/21 and WT/COMTD/23. Regarding implementation modalities, the Secretariat had circulated a revision of its non-paper on implementation modalities.3 At the Committee's last meeting, it was agreed that the Secretariat would revise the non-paper further to incorporate comments from delegations. He noted that no written comments had been received thus far, and urged that submissions be made quickly. He recalled that representatives from the ITC and UNCTAD had addressed the Committee at its last meeting in relation to technical cooperation activities of their respective organizations. Their comments had been incorporated into the Note of the Meeting.4 In addition, the Draft Annotated Outline for the Manual on Technical Cooperation and Training Activities had been circulated.5 It provided an overview of technical cooperation activities carried out by the WTO since its entry into force, and a synopsis of the Comprehensive and Integrated WTO Plan of Action for the Least-Developed Countries.6 The Draft Annotated Outline was merely indicative at this stage, and would benefit from the views of the delegations. He requested that the Secretariat finalize the Manual before the Committee's next meeting, planned for May. The Secretariat was also reviewing its technical cooperation programmes. This review took into account the various sources of funding presently available, including those financed by the WTO regular budget, the WTO Trust Fund for LDCs, and other ear-marked funds provided by certain Members. In conformity with the provision of Paragraph 4(a) of the Guidelines for Technical Cooperation,7 the Secretariat was in the process of preparing a comprehensive three-year plan, and the corresponding annual programme for 1997. In addition, the Secretariat was also preparing a computer-based interactive technical assistance and training package, to be used to introduce the WTO rules, rights and obligations in the same manner as through a general seminar. Its main support was a CD-ROM, but it would also be produced in a set of diskettes, taking into account hardware available in the beneficiary countries. Dissemination of the package would also, at a later stage, take place through the Trade and Development Web Site to be established under the WTO-World Bank Information Technologies for Development Project, in collaboration with other international institutions such as UNCTAD and the ITC.

"501",501,"85","85.    The representative of India recognized that e-commerce had become a major driver of international economic activity and international trade. In India, e-commerce was transforming the way business was being conducted, and represented one of the fastest growing segments of the economy. However, growth of e-commerce activities had given birth to new challenges, both for domestic and cross-border trade. These included issues relating to consumer protection and the sale of counterfeit goods and services, the safety of online payments, e-authentication procedures and digital signatures, taxation, as well as other challenges relating to shortages of skilled manpower, human resource development and logistics. As in most developing countries, including India, rules on these issues were still evolving, his delegation believed that it was premature to discuss rule-making in the area of e-commerce. Instead, discussions on e-commerce should be limited to the non-negotiating mandate of the Work Programme, and particularly focus, in the CTD, on addressing the development needs of developing countries. For example, as the growth of digital trade and e-commerce was dependent on technology, the Committee should examine how                                          WT/COMTD/M/103                                                 - 16 - to ensure an adequate transfer of technology. Similarly, Members needed to consider ways of reducing the digital divide, promoting increased internet access, and enhancing the mobilization of financial resources to develop the digital infrastructure in developing countries and LDCs. He also highlighted the importance of cooperation amongst Members, and sharing of experiences in areas such as consumer protection, safety of online payments, taxation, human resources development and logistics. Cooperation in the area of cyber security, electronic signatures and electronic documents was also important. In closing, he stressed the need for greater efforts by national governments and the international community to enhance the readiness of countries to engage in, and benefit from, digital trade. He also urged proponents to narrow their proposals and come up with specific issues that could be discussed in the CTD.","WTCOMTDM103.pdf","India, India, India, Work, Programme, CTD, Committee, Members, Members, CTD"
"502",502,"86","86.    The representative of Ecuador supported the intervention by, amongst others, South Africa, Uganda, Zimbabwe and Venezuela. While also supporting any initiatives within the Work Programme on E-commerce, she called upon Members to bear in mind that many of the past and present proposals did not have great meaning in the context where the majority of WTO Members did not enjoy some fundamental services, including a minimum access to the Internet and electricity. She was of the view that the Work Programme represented a framework for discussions that would help developing Members deepen the understandings of their needs so as to ensure a fair integration into the global economy, including through digital trade. As developing countries had different experiences and expectations for MC11, it would be important to have a very clear framework for negotiations on e-commerce ahead of MC11. In that respect, proponents should reformulate their proposals and ensure that they aligned with the Work Programme on e-commerce.","WTCOMTDM103.pdf","Ecuador, South, Africa, Uganda, Zimbabwe, Venezuela, Work, Programme, Members, WTO, Members, Work, Programme, Members, Work, Programme"

She noted that the event touched upon the development aspects of e-commerce and helped find synergies between the discussions taking place in UNCTAD and WTO on the development aspects of e-commerce. The event featured the theme “Can E-commerce Trade Rules help MSMEs in Developing Countries?”. The panellists included the WTO Secretariat, Singapore, Cambodia, the Global Express Association (GEA), the International Trade Centre (ITC) and the Thailand Vice Minister for Commerce, His Excellency Mr Winichai Chaemchaeng, who provided opening remarks. Panellists shared view on how e-commerce had enabled MSMEs to better integrate into the global economy, including by relying on existing WTO rules that applied to e-commerce as well as the common types of e-commerce rules found in RTAs. It was noted that interest in e-commerce cut across development levels in ASEAN, and this was exemplified by the commitment to some e-commerce disciplines taken by ASEAN countries in the ASEAN-Australia-New Zealand Free Trade Agreement (FTA). She informed the Committee that the outcome document, which provided a summary of the Lunch Panel reflections and key takeaways from this Panel was circulated in the CTD, the CTG, the TRIPs Council and the General Council. ASEAN Members looked forward to engaging constructively with other interested WTO Members on how to take forward the work on e-commerce.","WTCOMTDM103.pdf","Singapore, Lunch, Panel, ASEAN, UNCTAD, UNCTAD, WTO, WTO, Secretariat, Singapore, Cambodia, Global, Express, Association, International, Trade, Centre, ITC, Thailand, Winichai, Chaemchaeng, WTO, ASEAN, ASEAN, FTA, Committee, Lunch, Panel, CTD, CTG, TRIPs, Council, General, Council, ASEAN, Members, WTO, Members"
"504",504,"88","88.    The representative of Nigeria highlighted three points. First, the Committee had the responsibility to continue discussing e-commerce on the basis of the existing mandate and guidelines of the Work Programme on e-commerce as well as on the basis of proposals submitted by Members. Second, the proposal that Nigeria had co-sponsored was consistent with the focus of the CTD's discussions on the development implications of electronic commerce. Third, the Committee should consider a number of issues of interest to developing countries - some of which were highlighted by previous speakers - such as bridging the digital divide, access to infrastructure, technology, capacity building, along with other issues relating to the participation of developing countries in e-commerce. This would help Members have a better understanding on the e-commerce issues in order to take the e-commerce work forward. In closing, he believed that as in every Ministerial meeting there would be a decision on e-commerce at MC11. However, such decision could be similar to or go beyond the previous ones, and its scope would ultimately be decided upon on the basis of the Membership's consensus. As a result, the issue as to whether it was premature, or not, to make rules on e-commerce would be decided at an appropriate time.","WTCOMTDM103.pdf","Nigeria, Committee, Work, Programme, Members, Nigeria, CTD, Committee, Members"
"505",505,"89","89.  The representative of Cuba said that as noted by her delegation in other bodies of the WTO, Cuba was of the view that the work on e-commerce should be undertaken only on the basis of the 1998 Work Programme. She expressed full support for the interventions by South Africa, Uganda, Venezuela, India and Ecuador.

"507",507,"90","90.    The representative of Cameroon expressed surprise that the agenda item under consideration referred to the Work Programme on E-commerce whereas the first delegation which intervened made reference to a market access issue. He recalled that the discussions in the CTD should focus on the development aspects of e-commerce so as to ensure that developing country Members would be able to derive full benefits from their engagement on e-commerce. The negotiating aspects of e-commerce should be dealt with in other WTO bodies, while the development aspects should be addressed in the CTD - as the latter remained - above all, the body where the pertinence and effectiveness of Members' work was judged in terms of its development impact on developing countries. In his view, the main problem that should be addressed in the CTD was the digital divide among developed and developing countries. He argued that at a seminar organized by the Friends of E-commerce for Development, the Director-General had acknowledged that half of the world's population experienced an important digital gap, which could further increase. This explained why the discussion in the CTD should aim to reduce the digital gap, rather than enlarging it to a digital gulf. Overall, he proposed that the Committee consider two issues: first, what policies could help developing countries reduce the digital divide and benefit fairly from e-commerce?; second, would traditional means such as development aid help address the digital divide?. Referring to the Trade Facilitation Agreement (TFA), he said that there were no binding financial commitments from developed Members to finance the acquisition of capacity for countries that lacked such capacity. It followed that a WTO Agreement on e- commerce should be able to help Members genuinely participate in e-commerce, including by allowing developing countries to develop the requisite capacity to effectively engage on digital trade. The CTD had a key role in that respect. In closing, he hoped that the different proponents of submissions on e-commerce would take into account the interventions by South Africa, Swaziland, Cuba, Venezuela, Ecuador, and India so as to reflect development concerns in their proposals.","WTCOMTDM103.pdf","Cameroon, Work, Programme, CTD, Members, WTO, CTD, Members, CTD, Director-General, CTD, Committee, TFA, Members, Members, CTD, South, Africa, Swaziland, Cuba, Venezuela, Ecuador, India"

The Chairman said that he wished to provide Members with a brief update on the Preferential Trade Arrangements (PTAs) that were to be considered in Dedicated Sessions of the CTD. He noted that at a previous meeting of the CTD Regular session, Members had been informed that the US's trade preferences for Nepal were notified under the Transparency Mechanism for PTAs. The Secretariat had now received the US tariff schedule relating to these preferences and was in the process of drafting the factual presentation. Turning to the other PTAs to be considered in Dedicated Sessions, he said that the situation remained the same as was reported to Members at the March 2017 CTD meeting. In particular, there were five PTAs that had been notified - since the establishment of the Transparency Mechanism - for which the Secretariat had still not received the full set of data required for the preparation of factual presentations. These included the PTAs that were being implemented by China, India, the Russian Federation, Thailand and Chinese Taipei. He urged the notifying Members to provide the requisite data and information as soon as possible. In closing, he said that he also wished to mention that some Members had still not submitted data on imports by duty scheme, as provided in the Transparency Mechanism for PTAs. These included Iceland, Japan, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyz Republic, Morocco, New Zealand, Switzerland, Tajikistan and Turkey.","WTCOMTDM103.pdf","Chairman, Members, CTD, Members, US, Nepal, Secretariat, US, Members, Secretariat, China, India, Russian, Federation, Thailand, Taipei, Members, Members, Iceland, Japan, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyz, Republic, Morocco, New, Zealand, Switzerland, Tajikistan, Turkey"

Under this item, delegations had provided information on the steps they were taking, or had already taken, to provide DFQF market access to LDCs. Written communications by some Members had also been considered.","WTCOMTDM103.pdf","Chairman, LDCs, CTD, Members"
"512",512,"95","95.   The representative of Cambodia, on behalf of the LDC Group, thanked Members for providing DFQF to LDCs, as mandated in the Hong Kong and Bali Ministerial Decisions. He urged them not to backtrack on the implementation of the 2005 Hong Kong Ministerial and the 2013 Bali Ministerial Decisions on DFQF market access for LDCs, so as to provide increasingly greater market                                              WT/COMTD/M/103                                                     - 18 - access to LDCs, in a manner that would allow them to raise their trade volume. He also said that the developing country Members, declaring themselves in a position to do so, should, prior to the next Ministerial Conference, seek to improve their existing DFQF coverage for products originating in LDCs in a manner that would raise LDCs' trade volume. He went on to recall that the Bali Ministerial Decision had instructed Members to notify DFQF schemes for LDCs and any other relevant changes, pursuant to the Transparency Mechanism for PTAs. He requested that the CTD should continue to annually review the steps taken to provide DFQF market access to the LDCs, and report to the General Council for appropriate action. Finally, he reminded Members that the Group had submitted the draft Terms of References (ToRs) in the CTD for a clinical examination of DFQF implementation, with a view to identifying the problems hindering the full implementation of the DFQF market access. Therefore, he encouraged Members to inform the LDC Group of their concerns regarding these ToRs so as to allow it to accommodate these concerns.","WTCOMTDM103.pdf","Cambodia, LDC, Group, Members, Hong, Kong, Bali, Hong, Kong, Ministerial, Bali, Members, Members, LDCs, CTD, General, Council, Members, Group, CTD, Members, LDC, Group"

With respect to the revised ToRs, he explained that it had not been possible to accommodate all requests made by delegations during the consultations. In particular, the Group had decided to maintain the reference to the Hong Kong Decision, because it was felt that this Decision provided the appropriate background and mandate. Furthermore, the removal of the reference to this Decision from the revised ToRs had systemic implications for all LDC specific issues, including cotton, preferential rules of origin and the services waiver. He questioned the suggestion that no references could be made to the Doha Development Agenda (DDA), noting in particular that this had further implications, for example with respect to the implementation of the Ministerial Decisions from the Bali and Nairobi Ministerial Conferences. He also observed that the proposed clinical examination was not about the future, but rather about how DFQF had been implemented in the past. Any recommendations resulting from the study would have to be agreed to by consensus in the CTD.3","WTCOMTDM103.pdf","Uganda, Cambodia, Group, Hong, Kong, Doha, Development, Agenda, DDA, Bali, Nairobi, Ministerial, Conferences, DFQF"

The representative of Uruguay said that, on 12 June 2017, Uruguay had submitted a document on behalf of Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Mexico, Paraguay and Uruguay, which were members of LAIA. The document, circulated as WT/COMTD/N/53, contained 16 individual notifications that corresponded to each of the Agreements in the 1980 Treaty of Montevideo for the period covering 1 January 2016 – 31 December 2016. The notifications were developed and approved by the LAIA member states under the related Agreements, on the basis of the model established in the document WT/COMTD/63 dated 12 November 2007. These notifications were presented under the individual obligations of WTO Members to notify the instruments concluded under paragraph 4(a) of the Enabling Clause and in compliance with sections D to G of the Transparency Mechanism for RTAs, adopted by the Decision of 14 December 2006, without prejudice to notifications submitted individually by LAIA member states to the CTD or the CRTA. She added that the LAIA signatories of the aforementioned agreements had expressed their willingness to provide any additional information that might be required with respect to any particular aspects of the agreements at a dedicated session of the CTD, in accordance with paragraphs 16 and 18 of the Transparency Mechanism on RTAs.","WTCOMTDM103.pdf","Uruguay, Uruguay, Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Mexico, Paraguay, Uruguay, LAIA, Montevideo, LAIA, WTO, Members, LAIA, CTD, CRTA, LAIA, CTD"

The representative of Brazil supported the intervention by Uruguay, and noted that the individual notifications of the agreements concluded in 2016 under the umbrella of the 1980 Treaty of Montevideo were transmitted to the CTD and contained in document WT/COMTD/N/53. These agreements were notified under the Enabling Clause and the notification was drawn up in strict accordance with the standard format provided in document WT/COMTD/63. The notifications were submitted in accordance with individual notifications' obligations of Members, in compliance with the provisions in sections D to G of the Transparency Mechanism for RTAs. He stressed that all the information relating to LAIA Agreements and required in the notification format had been sent to the WTO Secretariat.

She noted, inter alia, that the ITC’s role within the Geneva trade hub was recognized by both the WTO Director-General and the Secretary General of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD). The Executive Director of the ITC had outlined the continued strong demand for ITC services – including with regard to a pipeline of projects valued at over US$ 200 million, and a delivery in 2016 of US$ 85 million – while a number of high-level speakers had shared their thoughts and experiences. With regard to the ITC's Annual Report for 2016, which was presented to the JAG, she said that the ITC had delivered on its targets, with 85% of country-specific interventions channelled to LDCs, Sub-Saharan Africa, landlocked developing countries, small island developing states, small vulnerable economies, and post-conflict and fragile states. The ITC continued to prioritize marginalized segments of society, including through its work on the SheTrades initiative. She went on to say that delegations at the JAG meeting had expressed appreciation for the ITC's focus on priority countries, and for the organization's continued emphasis on promoting inclusive and sustainable trade and economic growth. There was recognition of an improvement in internal coherence and evaluation, and of the ITC's efforts to collaborate with various partners and promote synergies between the private sector and government actors. In terms of thematic focus, delegates highlighted value-chain development, South-South trade and regional integration, export promotion and diversification, reducing non-tariff measures, and trade facilitation. Support was expressed for a number of initiatives, including SheTrades and the Export Potential Map. The ITC’s work on tourism, e-commerce and e-learning was also appreciated. With regard to small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), the 2016 edition of the SME Competitiveness Outlook was welcomed.","WTCOMTDM104.pdf","Chairperson, ITC, WTO, Director-General, United, Nations, Conference, on, Trade, and, Development, UNCTAD, Director, ITC, ITC, ITC, ITC, Sub-Saharan, Africa, ITC, ITC, ITC, ITC"

However, the CTD's rules of procedure, contained in document WT/COMTD/6 – and which was to be read in conjunction with the General Council's rules of procedure contained in document WT/L/161 – did indeed specify a four-week period for the issuance of meeting notices. He referred in particular to Rules 2, 3 and 4 of the CTD's rules of procedure, and observed that adherence to these rules would mean that the agenda for a meeting would close four weeks before a meeting, and documentation for the meeting would also need to be circulated before the agenda was issued.

The Chairman recalled that he had indicated at the beginning of the meeting that he wished to raise a matter under ""Other Business"" concerning the work being carried out by the Secretariat on a publication titled ""Mainstreaming Trade in the Sustainable Development Goals"". He informed the Committee that the Secretariat publication would offer insights on the role of trade and the WTO in achieving the SDGs in all three dimensions: economic, social and environmental. It would also provide guidance on how to mainstream trade to expand economic opportunities for poverty reduction, and how countries could get organized to deliver on the SDGs. Work on the publication was well advanced, and the Secretariat was aiming to launch it in the first half of 2018. Members could consider inviting the Secretariat to make a presentation of the publication at a future CTD meeting.","WTCOMTDM104.pdf","Chairman, Secretariat, Committee, Secretariat, WTO, Secretariat, Members, Secretariat, CTD"

Delegations also requested that work on trade and investment support institutions (TISI) development receive complementary support, in order to provide better services for SMEs. The ITC was invited to continue its efforts to diversify its funding mechanisms. In the second part of the meeting, the JAG was presented with the 2017 Annual Evaluation Synthesis Report, and with the outline of the new Strategic Plan for the 2018-2021 period. The discussion on the evaluation showcased the findings of the past year, while synthesizing lessons learned and providing recommendations to ITC management for future operations. Overall, the results were positive, and the ITC was found to be on track in terms of its core business and management approach. It was noted that the programmatic approach had been progressively integrated into new project design, and the organization's comparative advantage in supporting SMEs in their efforts to internationalize was confirmed. With regard to the Strategic Plan, the discussion centred on ensuring that the new strategy linked the ITC’s interventions to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), focused on customized approaches to the specific trade and development needs of clients, and prioritized results and impact. Delegations were invited to further contribute to the consultative process. In closing, she listed a number of events taking place during the WTO's Eleventh Ministerial Conference (MC11) in which the ITC would participate. These included the Trade and Sustainable Development Symposium, the launching of both a trade helpdesk for SMEs and a cotton portal, and an event concerning SheTrades in Argentina and the                                          WT/COMTD/M/104                                                  -4- promotion of an inclusive trade agenda.

"543",543,"16","16.    The representative of the ITTC said that the report was structured around three principal sections. There was firstly a section on the main developments in technical assistance (TA) in 2016 compared to the previous year. Another section addressed the implementation of the TA Plan and the main features of the TA provided in 2016, while a third section looked at the evaluation of performance in 2016. As part of his summary of the main developments in 2016, he observed that, while the volume of activities and related expenses remained stable, the Secretariat had been obliged to tap into its financial reserves, in light of a decrease in resources. He indicated that progress continued towards the full implementation of a TA management system based on results, and pointed to an improvement in the substantive content of the TA offer, including through a number of new courses. Turning to the implementation of the Biennial Technical Assistance and Training Plan (TA Plan) for the 2016-2017 period, he informed the Committee that 274 activities were delivered in 2016, and the Secretariat was also involved in 40 other activities. A total of 18,600 participants were trained, representing an increase of 25% compared to 2015. About 43% of the participants were women. As in previous years, priority continued to be given to Africa and the least developed countries (LDCs). Half of the TA provided had a general scope, while the specific subjects most in demand were sanitary and phytosanitary (SPS) measures, technical barriers to trade (TBT), market access for goods and trade-related aspects of intellectual property rights (TRIPS). In terms of languages, the most significant evolution was the increase in the proportion of activities offered with interpretation in at least one other language. Finally, he provided an overview of the section concerning the evaluation of performance – which he noted was positive overall, and was focused on the four Key Results identified in the TA Plan. The Committee was informed that Key Result 1 was the most successful, with 71% of its targets met. This was followed by Key Result 2 at 50%, Key Result 4 at 39%, and Key Result 3 at 25%.","WTCOMTDM104.pdf","ITTC, Secretariat, Committee, Secretariat, Africa, Committee"

"547",547,"2","2.     The representative of the United States indicated his delegation's concern with a number of matters relating to the issuance of agendas for CTD meetings and the preparation for these meetings. He explained that, even though the agenda for the present meeting had been issued on 3 November, his delegation had experienced difficulties in accessing it online until 7 November. In order to allow sufficient time for delegations to prepare for meetings, he requested that the four-week rule for the issuance of the agenda be reinstated, in accordance with the CTD's rules of procedure. After Members were provided with an initial agenda four weeks before a meeting, they should still be able to inscribe items until the time that the agenda for the meeting was circulated, ten days prior to the date of the meeting. He added that, according to the rules of procedure, the documents for a meeting also needed to be circulated when the agenda was circulated. However, in the present case, the Secretariat report on the participation of developing economies in the global trading system, as well as the CTD's draft annual report for 2017, had been issued after the circulation of the agenda. This had not provided Members with enough time to properly consider these documents. His delegation was also concerned that the recent notification by some members of the Latin American Integration Association (LAIA) – contained in document WT/COMTD/N/53 and introduced under ""Other Business"" at the last meeting – did not appear on the agenda for the present meeting. In addition, he made reference to the unofficial room document RD/DEV/155, and indicated that it was unclear where it fitted on the agenda, since it contained a summary of the Chairman's update on both regional trade agreements (RTAs) and preferential trade arrangements (PTAs), and the title of the document did not match any particular agenda item. In closing, he expressed appreciation for the Secretariat's engagement and openness in discussions on these issues with his delegation.","WTCOMTDM104.pdf","United, States, CTD, CTD, Members, Secretariat, CTD, Members, Latin, American, Integration, Association, LAIA, Chairman, Secretariat"

"550",550,"22","22.   The Chairman said that the TA Plan for the 2018-2019 period was contained in document WT/COMTD/W/227/Rev.1. The ITTC had prepared the Plan in full consultation with Members. Three preparatory documents were used during the consultation process. The first, which was an option paper on a feasibility study for a fee-paying training scheme, was contained in document WT/COMTD/W/226. The second paper, contained in document WT/COMTD/W/228, was an assessment by the Secretariat of the Advanced Trade Policy Course (ATPC). The third preparatory document, which was an option paper on enhancing the language mix in TA activities, was contained in document WT/COMTD/W/229. It was his understanding that the Committee on Budget, Finance and Administration (CBFA) would consider the financing of the Plan at its meeting on 16 November 2017.

"551",551,"23","23.    The representative of the ITTC recalled several informal meetings with Members that had been held in the course of 2017 to discuss the preparation of the TA Plan. He noted that the recent external evaluation of the WTO's TA, as well as the management response to the evaluation – which had been considered at the 101st Session of the CTD – had provided key inputs into the preparation of the Plan. A first version of the Plan had been circulated in document WT/COMTD/W/227 and was discussed with Members. Based on Members' comments, the Secretariat     had circulated a revision of the Plan, as contained                    in document WT/COMTD/W/227/Rev.1. This document was discussed at the CBFA meeting of 6 November, and was up for consideration at the present meeting. He said that the Plan aimed to reach its objectives by identifying four Key Results. In the context of the Plan, the Secretariat intended to continue promoting TA activities that focused on the implementation of WTO Agreements, while also continuing to review and refine its internal results-based management tools and related processes, and applying more comprehensively the Progressive Learning Strategy. The Secretariat was additionally aiming to make further improvements to its e-learning programme, its pedagogical methods, and its use of value-adding partnerships and Trade Policy Review follow-ups. The logframe had also been revisited to improve the relevance of the performance indicators chosen. He added that the Secretariat was seeking to carry out the actions outlined in its response to the external evaluation – including by looking into the link between TA and gender issues, the availability of course offerings in all three languages, and revising the ATPC – and would continue to engage with Members on issues raised in the evaluation. The Secretariat also wished to address the constraints arising from the limited availability of suitable training rooms in the WTO campus. In closing, he indicated that the Plan had been prepared on the assumption that TA resources would be stable during the next biennium, thereby allowing approximately the same level of TA activity to be maintained as in previous years.","WTCOMTDM104.pdf","ITTC, Members, WTO, CTD, Members, Members, Secretariat, CBFA, Secretariat, WTO, Secretariat, Secretariat, ATPC, Members, Secretariat, WTO"

The representative of the European Union emphasized the importance of the WTO's TA in enabling developing countries and LDCs to participate effectively in the multilateral trading system (MTS).

"553",553,"25","25.   The representative of Singapore recalled two gender-relevant recommendations which had been put forward by the external evaluators. The first, which was Recommendation 11, was to continue to monitor and report on the participation of women and men with a view to addressing                                         WT/COMTD/M/104                                                 -6- remaining gender imbalances of participation in WTO TA. The second – Recommendation 19 – was to take every opportunity to integrate issues of gender equality and the empowerment of women into TA programmes and training material in the context of emerging initiatives on social and poverty implications of trade, including the SDGs. Her delegation understood and supported the need to facilitate the participation of women in TA activities, and therefore encouraged the Secretariat to continue to make efforts to ensure that this goal was achieved. In this regard, she expressed her support for Recommendation 11. With regard to Recommendation 19, she noted from section 3.3.1 of the TA Plan – which concerned TA and gender issues – that the Secretariat was proposing to introduce modules on trade and gender, with a view to raising awareness and enhancing the aptitude of policymakers to incorporate gender considerations in their trade policy development or negotiations. In this regard, she believed that some caution needed to be exercised. She explained that gender did not feature in the WTO Agreements, and there was presently no consensus or full understanding of the role of gender vis-à-vis the making of trade rules. The proposed modules could therefore influence substantive discussions on the matter, which were still in their nascent stages. In this light, her delegation wished to know more about the elements that would be included in the proposed modules in the context of e-learning, the APTCs and the Regional Trade Policy Courses (RTPCs). She also sought information on how the proposed modules would tie in with the TA mandate, and how the content would be separated from any potential substantive discussions at the WTO on the subject.","WTCOMTDM104.pdf","Singapore, WTO, Secretariat, Recommendation, Secretariat, WTO, WTO"

As for document WT/COMTD/W/192, he recalled that the proponents had indicated at the last meeting their willingness to consider the circulation of a new document, which would contain only the remaining proposal. He also informed the Committee that he had convened an informal consultation with the proponents on 2 October 2017, in order to ascertain progress with respect to the circulation of the new document. The delegations that attended had indicated that the proponents would still need time to discuss the matter amongst themselves in order to determine a way forward.

He explained that the proposal contained in document WT/COMTD/W/208 was a simple paraphrasing of the CTD's TORs, which specified that the CTD served as a focal point for consideration and coordination of development work in the WTO. In addition, paragraphs 3 and 4 of the TORs indicated that the CTD was to report to the General Council for appropriate action on matters relating to the review of the application of special provisions in favour of developing Members and LDCs, as well as in the context of any questions regarding their use or application. He believed that it was appropriate for the CTD to report regularly on the development-related work taking place in other WTO bodies, while providing the necessary recommendations to the General Council on achieving better coordination within the WTO on development issues.

With regard to this proposal, he said that the Transparency Mechanism for RTAs (RTA TM) provided for several notifications to be carried out by Members parties to RTAs. In order to avoid misunderstandings and to help ensure a timely consideration of RTAs, and hence the smooth operation of the TM, it was important for the parties to submit their notification and information requirements jointly. He recalled that, at the last CTD meeting, the Committee was informed that the proponents were holding consultations in order to submit a revised document containing only the remaining proposal. Progress was being made in this regard. He also clarified that there would not be any changes to the remaining proposal itself.

Weak economic activity in both developed and developing regions – coupled with the fall in energy and commodity prices – explained a decline in export earnings, which had also reduced the capacity of some developing economies to import. African and Middle Eastern economies had been particularly affected by the fall in merchandise exports, while the export contraction in developing economies in Asia and Europe was less pronounced. South-South trade continued to account for an important share of developing economies' merchandise trade – around 50%. This was mainly explained by the key role of trade in manufactured products, particularly between Asian economies. With respect to commercial services, the Committee was informed that developing economies' contribution to world exports of commercial services had risen from 29.9% in 2014 to 30.5% in 2016, while developing economies' participation in world imports of commercial services had increased from 38% to 38.3%. Although weak merchandise trade and overcapacity in the shipping sector had led to heavy losses in the transport sector of developing economies, enhanced air connectivity and cheaper air fares had allowed developing economies to benefit from 41 million more tourists in 2016 relative to 2014. China played a leading role in boosting the tourism sector growth in neighbouring Asian economies, while Northern African economies had experienced a drop in travel earnings. It was noted that Asian economies were the main contributors to developing economies' participation in the other commercial services category.","WTCOMTDM104.pdf","Egypt, African, Group, India, Chairman, CTD, Asia, Europe, Committee, China"

She indicated that the issues contained in documents WT/COMTD/W/208 and WT/COMTD/W/192 were of relevance for developing countries and the MTS. With respect to the proposal in WT/COMTD/W/208, she explained that the CTD was the focal point for consideration and coordination of development issues in the WTO, and that the proponents were simply aiming to fulfil Ministers' instructions to fully operationalize the mandate of the CTD. It was not only a matter of ensuring the good functioning of the CTD, but also ensuring the effectiveness of the political guidance from MC8. Turning to the remaining proposal contained in document WT/COMTD/W/192, she expressed support for the initiative to circulate a revised document. She said that the dual notification of RTAs remained an important issue, and Members needed to give attention to the proposal. The communication from China, Egypt and India, circulated in document WT/COMTD/W/175, further elaborated on the systemic and specific issues arising from dual notifications, with a view to finding an appropriate solution.","WTCOMTDM104.pdf","China, India, Egypt, Chairman, CTD, WTO, CTD, CTD, Members, China, Egypt, India"
"571",571,"41","41.   The representative of the European Union indicated that her delegation's position on the remaining proposals contained in documents WT/COMTD/W/208 and WT/COMTD/W/192 remained the same as had been outlined in past CTD meetings. She welcomed the willingness of the proponents to engage in informal consultations.","WTCOMTDM104.pdf","European, Union"
"572",572,"42","42.    The representative of the United States appreciated the Chairman's efforts to help find a way forward on the remaining proposals. He pointed out that several years had passed since the proposals had been submitted, which was sufficient time for other Members to have fully considered them. Furthermore the proponents had not taken any initiative to advance their ideas. In this light, he believed that it was time for the proponents to practice what they had been pointing to in other WTO bodies, either by revising their proposals or by removing the items relating to these two documents from the CTD's agenda. Turning specifically to the remaining proposal contained in document WT/COMTD/W/192, he said that the United States had repeatedly shared the view that the proposal suggested a diminishing of Members' substantive rights and obligations under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT). In his delegation's view, there was no prospect for consensus on this matter in either the CTD or the Committee on Regional Trade Agreements (CRTA). The only outcome from the proposal would be to provide one Member with the right to prevent others from availing of an exception to the GATT under the Enabling Clause, or from complying with the notification obligations under the Enabling Clause. He believed that this would be prejudicial to that Member in the face of any dispute settlement proceedings regarding a particular agreement. The proponents had so far failed to address this concern, and his delegation looked forward to seeing how these issues would be reconciled.

"574",574,"44","44.    The Chairman encouraged continued engagement among Members in order to try and make progress, and indicated his willingness to work with delegations in this regard. He recalled that the practice in the CTD was to maintain an item on the agenda if any Member so requested. Therefore, as there were such requests, the sub-items relating to the two proposals would be maintained on the CTD's agenda.","WTCOMTDM104.pdf","Chairman, Members, CTD, Member, CTD"

"576",576,"46","46.     The Chairman said that he wished to provide Members with a brief update on RTAs notified under the Enabling Clause. He indicated that for Egypt's accession to the Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA), the parties had been requested to provide the data for the preparation of the factual presentation by 6 June 2017. The Secretariat had thus far received data from Egypt, Seychelles, and Swaziland. With regard to the agreement between the Dominican Republic and Panama, the Secretariat had received data and had started preparing the factual presentation. Concerning Afghanistan's accession to the South Asian Free Trade Agreement (SAFTA), the Secretariat had still not received the data from the parties, which had been requested by 22 December 2016. The Secretariat had received data only from Bangladesh for the original SAFTA notification. Turning to the Arab Mediterranean Free Trade Agreement (Agadir Agreement) between Egypt, Jordan, Morocco and Tunisia, he said that a draft factual presentation had been sent on 11 April 2017, without the tariff or trade information from Tunisia. Comments, which were requested by 23 May 2017, had been received from Egypt, Jordan and Morocco. Data had also been received from Tunisia, but the negative lists of Tunisia and Egypt were yet to be sent. As for the agreement between the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) and Singapore, he indicated that a draft factual presentation had been sent to the parties. However, the Secretariat was still waiting to receive complete data from the GCC parties. Data had been received from Singapore, Bahrain, Kuwait and Oman, and the Secretariat was presently seeking further clarification from Bahrain and Kuwait. Data on preferential tariffs and exceptions to most-favoured-nation (MFN) rates had also not been received from the other GCC parties.","WTCOMTDM104.pdf","Chairman, Members, Egypt, Common, Market, for, Eastern, and, Southern, Africa, COMESA, Secretariat, Egypt, Seychelles, Swaziland, Dominican, Republic, Panama, Secretariat, Afghanistan, SAFTA, Secretariat, Secretariat, Bangladesh, SAFTA, Egypt, Jordan, Morocco, Tunisia, Tunisia, Egypt, Jordan, Morocco, Tunisia, Tunisia, Egypt, Gulf, Cooperation, Council, GCC, Singapore, Secretariat, GCC, Singapore, Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Secretariat, Bahrain, Kuwait, MFN, GCC"
"577",577,"47","47.    Turning to the accession of Rwanda and Burundi to the East African Community, he said that the Secretariat was awaiting comments on the draft factual presentation, which had been requested by 16 June 2014. For a number of other RTAs – namely, RTAs between India and Nepal, India and Afghanistan, India and Bhutan, and Cuba and El Salvador – no data had been submitted by the parties. He urged all the parties to these agreements to provide the data as soon as possible. He went on to say that there remained one RTA notified under the Enabling Clause that had not been ratified by all the parties. This was the Pacific Island Countries Trade Agreement (PICTA). Following the procedures of the CRTA, a factual presentation of an RTA falling in this category would only be drafted after the agreement had been ratified by all the parties. The parties to PICTA were urged to inform the Secretariat as soon as all ratifications were completed. He also informed the Committee of two newer notifications. The first concerned the India-Thailand agreement, which had been notified on 18 June 2017 in document WT/COMTD/N/54. The parties to this agreement had been requested to submit the required data by 10 November 2017, but so far no data had been received. The second concerned the agreement between MERCOSUR and the Southern African Customs Union, which had been notified on 19 July 2017 in document WT/COMTD/N/55. The parties had been requested to submit the required data by 11 December 2017.","WTCOMTDM104.pdf","Rwanda, Burundi, Secretariat, India, Nepal, India, Afghanistan, India, Bhutan, Cuba, El, Salvador, RTA, Pacific, Island, CRTA, RTA, Secretariat, Committee, India-Thailand, MERCOSUR, Southern, African, Customs, Union"
"578",578,"48","48.   He continued by noting that, on 2 October 2017, he had convened an informal consultation with Members that had notified RTAs, as well as PTAs, which were to be considered in Dedicated Sessions of the CTD, but had yet to submit the full set of data or information to the Secretariat. Representatives from the Secretariat had attended this meeting to clarify the data and information requirements, and to answer any questions. He expressed hope that this consultation had been useful, and would help in expediting the submission of the required data and information. Finally, with regard to LAIA, he recalled that a notification on behalf of Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Mexico, Paraguay and Uruguay – members of LAIA – circulated in document WT/COMTD/N/53, was introduced under “Other Business” at the last CTD meeting. Members had been informed that this                                          WT/COMTD/M/104                                                 - 10 - document contained 16 individual notifications – one for each of the agreements concluded under the 1980 Treaty of Montevideo over the period 1 January 2016 – 31 December 2016. According to the document, these notifications had been submitted pursuant to the individual obligation of WTO Members to notify instruments concluded under paragraph 4(a) of the Enabling Clause, and in compliance with sections D to G of the RTA TM, without prejudice to notifications submitted individually by LAIA members to the CTD or the CRTA. He added that issues relating to the LAIA agreements had been discussed previously in the CTD and in the CRTA. The European Union had also recently circulated additional questions which had been considered at the CRTA meeting of 9 November 2017. He also noted that the CRTA Secretariat had been in touch with LAIA countries and had sought clarification on certain aspects of the LAIA agreements that had been notified.","WTCOMTDM104.pdf","Members, CTD, Secretariat, Secretariat, LAIA, Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Mexico, Paraguay, Uruguay, Members, Montevideo, WTO, Members, RTA, TM, LAIA, CTD, CRTA, LAIA, CTD, CRTA, European, Union, CRTA, CRTA, Secretariat, LAIA, LAIA"
"579",579,"49","49.   The representative of the United States expressed appreciation for the Chairman's efforts to report regularly to the Committee on progress in the implementation of the RTA TM. He believed that discussion in the CTD on this matter would be enhanced by a better reflection on the agenda of the content and purpose of the Chairman's report. He explained that the report made reference to the various steps involved in the implementation of the RTA TM, and pointed to the obligations that some Members had not yet met. Noting that the Committee had a role in addressing these issues, he requested the Chairman to henceforth provide a detailed agenda item that would more accurately reflect the report provided, as was done in the CRTA. This would allow Members to have a better preview of what was expected from them. He also urged the parties to the RTAs, referred to by the Chairman in his report to provide the required data as soon as possible, so as to allow the preparation of factual presentations on these RTAs. He went on to say that he was surprised that notifications of RTAs under the Enabling Clause were not listed under the present agenda item. In this regard, he requested that the CTD follow the practice in other WTO bodies, by ensuring that each notification submitted to the Committee be reflected on the agenda for the first meeting after the submission was made. This would allow Members to take note of the submission and ask questions if appropriate. He emphasized the importance of respecting the timelines set out in the RTA TM, since waiting for sporadic Dedicated Sessions of the CTD to include the items concerning these notifications on the agenda was not consistent with the transparency framework of the Mechanism. He also noted more generally that his delegation had observed a wide divergence in practice between the CTD and the CRTA, and the relevant Secretariat staff, in the implementation of the RTA TM. He suggested that the CTD Chairman, along with the CRTA Chairman and relevant Secretariat staff, undertake internal consultations to compare the policies and practices relating to the implementation of the RTA TM. His delegation would follow up on this matter with the intention of ensuring that the Mechanism was implemented consistently across the two bodies.","WTCOMTDM104.pdf","United, States, Chairman, Committee, RTA, CTD, Chairman, RTA, TM, Members, Committee, Chairman, CRTA, Members, Chairman, CTD, WTO, Committee, Members, CTD, CTD, CRTA, Secretariat, RTA, CTD, Chairman, CRTA, Chairman, Secretariat, RTA"
"580",580,"5","5.     The Chairman recalled that, at previous sessions of the CTD, Members had agreed to invite a number of intergovernmental organizations on an ad hoc meeting-by-meeting basis. These were the Arab Maghreb Union, the Economic Community of Central African States, the Economic Community of West African States, the Economic Cooperation Organisation, the Inter-Arab Investment Guarantee Corporation, the Islamic Development Bank, the African Union, the Organisation of the Islamic Conference, the South Centre, the Pacific Islands Forum, the United Nations Environment Programme, the West African Economic and Monetary Union, and the World Intellectual Property Organization. These organizations had been invited to the present meeting. He proposed that the same organizations be invited to the next formal meeting of the CTD.","WTCOMTDM104.pdf","Chairman, CTD, Members, Arab, Maghreb, Union, Economic, Community, of, Central, African, States, Economic, Community, of, West, African, States, Economic, Cooperation, Organisation, Inter-Arab, Investment, Guarantee, Corporation, Islamic, Development, Bank, African, Union, Islamic, Conference, South, Centre, Pacific, Islands, Forum, United, Nations, Environment, Programme, West, African, Economic, and, Monetary, Union, World, Intellectual, Property, Organization, CTD"
"581",581,"50","50.    He then turned to the notification circulated by a number of LAIA countries, contained in document WT/COMTD/N/53. He explained that his delegation had some comments on the notification, and had expected it to be listed under the present agenda item. While appreciating the notification, his delegation wished to raise some initial questions on procedural and substantive elements, and revert to the matter as a formal agenda item at the next meeting. He went on to say that he did not fully understand the intention of the LAIA countries that had submitted this notification. In particular, he wished to better understand what had been notified and why these Members had chosen this manner of notification. The cover note of the document contained language which his delegation believed was internally contradictory, and the information provided in the notification template was different from what was provided in the cover note. Furthermore, his delegation was confused by the issuance of one notification with one document symbol for what had been explained in the cover note as 16 individual notifications, but which was in fact five separate agreements with a variety of LAIA countries, and not the same Members for each notification. His delegation looked forward to discussing these concerns in greater detail – given that this notification was different from any notification his delegation was familiar with, and that a consolidation in this manner seemed to undermine the transparency goals at the heart of the notification itself.","WTCOMTDM104.pdf","LAIA, Members, Members"
"582",582,"51","51.    With regard to the issue of what was being notified, he sought clarity on whether the notification represented entire agreements, or parts of agreements. He also wished to know whether the intent was the same for all the agreements referred to in the document, or if the intent differed among the five separate agreements. With regard to the indication by the notifying Members at the last CTD meeting that the notification conformed to the common notification format contained in document WT/COMTD/63, he shared his delegation's view that the notification template was for individual agreements, and not for five unrelated agreements in one document.                                         WT/COMTD/M/104                                                - 11 - Noting that the practice in the CRTA on the numbering and tracking of notifications had greatly improved the transparency for Members, he recommended that the CTD follow this practice, since Enabling Clause notifications seemed to be given random numbers – which made more difficult the tracking of subsequent changes, modifications, accessions, and the final implementation reports. He said that he was raising these issues at the present time, in light of his understanding that LAIA members had sought assistance from Secretariat staff in preparing the notification. His delegation had also met with Secretariat staff in an attempt to get answers to its questions, but had been unable to. He believed that this indicated a lack of clarity that the Committee needed to address. In closing, he expressed appreciation for the effort by LAIA members to pursue the notification of their instruments, but also indicated that the progress made through dialogue on this issue over the years could be stalled if the Committee continued to be confronted with notifications that were confusing or unclear. Some of his delegation's concerns related to the notifying Members' intent, while other concerns were with respect to an inconsistent handling of RTA notifications across WTO bodies.","WTCOMTDM104.pdf","Members, CRTA, Members, CTD, LAIA, Secretariat, Secretariat, Committee, LAIA, Committee, Members, RTA, WTO"
"583",583,"52","52.    The representative of the European Union thanked the Chairman for his update. She said that her delegation was presently considering the notification concerning the MERCOSUR-SACU agreement, and might have questions on it at a later date. With regard to LAIA, she recalled the European Union's questions that were circulated in the CRTA in document WT/REG/W/109, as well as the LAIA replies contained in document WT/COMTD/W/224. The European Union had also submitted follow-up questions in document WT/REG/W/124. She believed that the notification contained in document WT/COMTD/N/53 was a positive step in the right direction, as it facilitated the European Union's understanding of the wide network of LAIA agreements. Notwithstanding this, the European Union had some questions on the format and content of the notification, which was different from standard notifications. She noted that the practice in the CRTA was for an individual number to be assigned to each notified RTA. This allowed Members to track subsequent changes to the RTA, while linking these changes to the underlying agreement – or what the European Union referred to as the ""mother agreement"". In light of this, the European Union did not know how to interpret the notification by the LAIA countries, and sought clarification on the extent to which the document contained references to subsequent changes to an underlying RTA. She explained that her delegation's follow-up questions circulated in the CRTA aimed, among other things, to identify LAIA members' underlying RTAs, and to determine whether these RTAs had been notified. She added that the European Union was open to discuss the LAIA replies to these follow-up questions at a joint dedicated technical session of the CTD and CRTA. This would address the concern of the LAIA members that wished to discuss the matter in the CTD.","WTCOMTDM104.pdf","European, Union, Chairman, LAIA, European, Union, CRTA, LAIA, European, Union, European, Union, European, Union, CRTA, RTA, Members, RTA, European, Union, European, Union, LAIA, RTA, CRTA, LAIA, European, Union, LAIA, CTD, CRTA, LAIA, CTD"

The representative of Uruguay recalled that her delegation had submitted a notification – circulated in document WT/COMTD/N/53 – on behalf of Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Mexico, Paraguay and Uruguay. The document, which had been introduced under ""Other Business"" at the last meeting, contained 16 individual notifications that corresponded to each of the agreements concluded under the 1980 Treaty of Montevideo for the period covering 1 January 2016 – 31 December 2016. These notifications were submitted under the individual obligations of WTO Members to notify the instruments concluded under paragraph 4(a) of the Enabling Clause and in compliance with sections D to G of the RTA TM, without prejudice to notifications submitted individually by LAIA member states to the CTD or the CRTA. She added that LAIA members were committed to the transparency required by the RTA TM for the notification of agreements. This was why LAIA members did not have any problem with the inclusion of the LAIA notification on the CTD agenda. She thanked the European Union and the United States for their comments on the notification, and requested that they be provided in writing to LAIA members. She also indicated that the LAIA members were presently considering the European Union's follow-up questions circulated in the CRTA.","WTCOMTDM104.pdf","Uruguay, Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Mexico, Paraguay, Uruguay, Montevideo, WTO, Members, RTA, TM, LAIA, CTD, CRTA, LAIA, RTA, TM, LAIA, LAIA, CTD, European, Union, United, States, LAIA, European, Union, CRTA"

He said that the comments by the European Union and the United States would be duly relayed to his capital. He added that Brazil's commitment to transparency was embodied in the circulation of the notification contained in document WT/COMTD/N/53, which was submitted using the standard format of notification. In doing so, LAIA countries aimed to address some of the concerns raised by other Members on the manner in which the LAIA agreements were being notified to the CTD. He expressed his delegation's readiness to respond to specific questions on the agreements included in the notification, as provided for in paragraphs 16 and 18 of the RTA TM. With regard to the procedural issues raised by the United States, he indicated that the LAIA members were willing to follow the Committee's procedures.

"593",593,"61","61.   The representative of India indicated that his intervention related to the three sub-items under the present agenda item. He noted that the systemic concerns that were raised by China, Egypt and India over the legal and procedural implications of the dual notification of the GCC Customs Union under both the Enabling Clause and GATT Article XXIV were pertinent even now, but they remained unaddressed. Some Members had expressed the view that the systemic concerns raised in document WT/COMTD/W/175 were outside the scope of the CTD, and needed to be discussed in the Negotiating Group on Rules. The view of his delegation was that the CTD was the appropriate forum to consider the questions arising from RTAs with a dual notification. Pointing to the terms of reference of the CTD contained in document WT/L/46, he noted that the CTD was designated to serve as a focal point for consideration and coordination of work on development in the WTO and its relationship to development-related activities in other multilateral agencies. He added that the Committee could consult with other WTO bodies in addressing the systemic concerns raised in document WT/COMTD/W/175. This was in keeping with paragraph 3 of the CTD's TORs, which entrusted the Committee to review periodically, in consultation as appropriate with the relevant bodies of the WTO, the application of special provisions in the Multilateral Trade Agreements and related Ministerial Decisions in favour of developing country Members, and in particular LDC Members, and report to the General Council for appropriate action.","WTCOMTDM104.pdf","China, Egypt, India, GCC, Customs, Union, GATT, Members, CTD, CTD, CTD, CTD, WTO, Committee, WTO, CTD, Committee, WTO, Members, Members, General, Council"
"594",594,"62","62.   He went on to outline some of the issues raised in document WT/COMTD/W/175 which he believed needed to be addressed. He indicated firstly that Members needed to consider the legal and procedural implications of notifying the GCC Customs Union on the basis of the Enabling Clause and GATT Article XXIV, without either notification being withdrawn. Members also needed         2           The discussion with respect to the three sub-items is presented together in this Note, since the Chairman noted in the course of the discussion under the first sub-item that Members' interventions related to all three sub-items, and in this light invited continued interventions on the three sub-items together.

He additionally pointed to the question of how the CTD should deal in the future with RTAs between developing Members that were notified under the Enabling Clause, insofar as this related to the fulfilment of paragraphs 1 and 4 of the CTD's TORs. There was also the issue of whether a Member could notify an RTA under a specific legal provision unilaterally – without the consent of the other parties to the RTA – and whether a notification could be made on behalf of all the parties to the RTA under another legal provision. Furthermore, the implications arising from Members retaining a notification under the Enabling Clause – but not conducting a factual consideration of the RTA in the CTD – needed to be addressed, as did the question of how this would figure specifically in the case of the GCC Customs Union, where a factual review had been scheduled. In concluding, he indicated that the three sub-items under the present agenda item should remain on the CTD's agenda until the systemic and specific concerns arising from ""dually notified"" RTAs were addressed.","WTCOMTDM104.pdf","Members, GCC, Customs, Union, GATT, Members, Chairman, Members, CTD, CRTA, RTA, CTD, Members, CTD, Member, RTA, RTA, RTA, Members, RTA, CTD, GCC, Customs, Union, CTD"
"595",595,"63","63.    The representative of the European Union said that it was important to clarify the legal and procedural questions arising from an agreement being notified by parties under different legal provisions. She felt that a pragmatic solution to the notifications in question was needed, and indicated that any substantive discussion on the matter should take place in the framework of the implementation of Paragraph 28 of the Nairobi Ministerial Declaration. In addition, she emphasized the importance of making a distinction between the different notifications. With regard to the GCC Customs Union notification, she repeated the European Union's position conveyed at previous CTD meetings that a customs union could not be notified under the Enabling Clause. In that respect, she urged the GCC parties to withdraw their notification under the Enabling Clause. As for the notifications of the ASEAN-Korea and India-Korea agreements, she called on the parties to these agreements to make efforts to find a pragmatic solution.","WTCOMTDM104.pdf","European, Union, Nairobi, GCC, Customs, Union, European, Union, CTD, GCC, India-Korea"
"596",596,"64","64.    The representative of the United States said that he largely agreed with the comments by the European Union. He additionally pointed out that the GCC parties' notification under GATT Article XXIV was presently going through a process in the CRTA. The parties had submitted data to the Secretariat and a factual presentation had been drafted for circulation in the CRTA. The Secretariat was currently waiting for comments from the parties. In this respect, he questioned the need to discuss the matter in the CTD. With regard to document WT/COMTD/W/175, he believed that the issue raised of how to proceed with the consideration of RTAs notified under both the Enabling Clause and GATT Article XXIV was an interesting one. However, he also noted that neither India nor ASEAN members had fulfilled their obligations by providing the data necessary for the preparation of the factual presentations on the ASEAN-Korea and India-Korea agreements. Once the factual presentations were prepared, Members could discuss how to move forward with the consideration of these agreements. The intention of his delegation was to ask each of the parties to these agreements that had not submitted the data to provide information on the status of data submission. He stressed that it would only be possible to discuss the question of the venue for the consideration of these agreements after the parties had submitted the required data.","WTCOMTDM104.pdf","United, States, European, Union, GCC, GATT, CRTA, Secretariat, CRTA, Secretariat, CTD, GATT, India, ASEAN, India-Korea, Members"

He noted that issues relating to dual notifications of RTAs had appeared on the CTD's agenda for several years, and that his delegation had engaged in discussions with interested Members, and with CTD Chairs, with a view to resolving the matter. He recalled that Korea had duly notified its RTAs – and in particular the ASEAN-Korea and India-Korea agreements – in accordance with GATT Article XXIV and GATS Article V, and in compliance with the RTA TM. He believed that a Member had a right to decide under which provisions it would notify the RTAs it had concluded. It was also possible that the parties to an RTA would agree upon this during their negotiations or notification preparation. Furthermore, while the Enabling Clause was designed to allow developing Members to accord differential and more favourable treatment to each other, he was unsure whether the ASEAN-Korea and India-Korea agreements fell into this category. With regard to RTA notifications, he indicated that there were some systemic issues listed in document WT/COMTD/W/175 and other submissions, and emphasized the need to find an appropriate approach to address the matter. In this regard, he expressed some doubt on the possibility of a separate consideration in the CRTA and in the CTD, and shared his view that all RTAs should be considered in a comprehensive way in the same body, irrespective of whether they covered trade in goods or trade in services. He also pointed to the mandate in Paragraph 28 of the Nairobi Ministerial Declaration, and indicated that the timing was right to discuss RTA notification issues. He suggested that the items concerning dual notifications be removed from the CTD's agenda, at least                                        WT/COMTD/M/104                                               - 14 - during the discussions on the transformation of the current provisional RTA TM into a permanent mechanism.","WTCOMTDM104.pdf","Korea, CTD, Members, Korea, India-Korea, GATT, RTA, Member, RTA, Members, India-Korea, RTA, CRTA, CTD, RTA, CTD, RTA, TM"

The Chairman recalled that, at earlier meetings of the CTD in 2017, the Committee had considered a number of communications relating to the Work Programme on Electronic Commerce. At the present meeting, a communication from China, contained in document JOB/DEV/49, was listed on the agenda. He invited China to introduce the communication.","WTCOMTDM104.pdf","Chairman, CTD, Committee, Work, Programme, Electronic, Commerce, China, China"
"600",600,"68","68.     The representative of China said that her delegation had introduced an earlier communication contained in document JOB/DEV/39/Rev.1 – titled ""Aiming at the 11th Ministerial Conference"", and co-sponsored with Pakistan – in a number of WTO bodies. In this context, and in order to ensure the inclusiveness of the MTS, China had emphasized that e-commerce discussions in the WTO should be based on the mandate of the 1998 Work Programme on Electronic Commerce, and should have the development dimension at its core. China had also proactively shared with Members its experience on measures taken to develop e-commerce in order to facilitate progress in this area at MC11. Based on Members' inputs and concerns raised in previous discussions, China had submitted the communication contained in document JOB/DEV/49, titled ""E-commerce elements for MC11"". This newer communication highlighted elements of interest to most Members. Her delegation hoped that the elements of this communication would form part of the MC11 outcome on e-commerce, and could serve as building blocks for future work. She proposed that, in light of the cross-cutting nature of e-commerce, these elements could be explored in a dedicated session of the General Council, or in a body to be agreed upon by all Members. She hoped that positive consideration would be given to some specific elements of this communication – including the moratorium on customs duties on electronic transmissions, the facilitation of cross-border e-commerce, transparency, and development and cooperation.","WTCOMTDM104.pdf","China, Pakistan, WTO, MTS, China, WTO, China, Members, Members, China, Members, General, Council, Members"
"601",601,"69","69.    She indicated that she wished to elaborate further on the elements of the communication relating to development and cooperation. In this regard, she said that the experience of several Members had shown that e-commerce was conducive to development – including by helping farmers and micro, small, and medium-sized enterprises (MSMEs) in remote areas to better integrate into domestic and international trade markets. She added that discussions on e-commerce at the WTO needed to take into account the specific needs of developing Members and LDCs, and enhance their ability to benefit from e-commerce, including through the principle of special and differential treatment. Given the complexity of e-commerce issues and the different development levels of Members, she suggested that Members could cooperate on areas of common interest, and jointly explore how to make progress on e-commerce issues at MC11 and beyond, so as to allow the MTS to maintain its relevance in this area. In closing, she noted that China had also introduced this communication at the November 2017 meeting of the Council for Trade in Goods (CTG), and indicated her delegation's willingness to further discuss the issues raised in the communication with interested Members.","WTCOMTDM104.pdf","Members, WTO, Members, Members, Members, MTS, China, Council, for, Trade, in, Goods, Members"

"603",603,"70","70.    The representative of the European Union indicated that she wished to briefly present a communication contained in document JOB/GC/140 and its revisions, which her delegation had co-sponsored with a number of other Members. The communication proposed the establishment of a Working Party on E-Commerce to address cross-cutting issues. The Working Party would conduct preparations for, and carry out negotiations on, the trade-related aspects of e-commerce on the basis of proposals by Members. The draft ministerial decision contained in the communication was neutral with respect to substance, and it would be up to Members to bring their issue of interests with respect to any trade-related aspects of e-commerce. This approach would ensure that any matter which was important to a Member, or a group of Members, could be discussed and negotiated. The co-sponsors believed that this was a constructive way to proceed, which took into account the sensitivities that existed across the Membership, and built upon the debate in the previous two years. The suggestion was not to adopt a pre-set agenda, but rather to allow Members to collectively build a negotiating agenda.

"604",604,"71","71.    The representative of Chinese Taipei said that he wished to introduce two communications that his delegation had recently circulated in the CTD in documents JOB/DEV/45 and JOB/DEV/46. He said that he would not repeat the full content of the communications, as they had already been presented in the Council for Trade in Services (CTS) meeting in October, and the CTG in November. Turning first to document JOB/DEV/45, he said that the communication aimed to identify the fundamental differences between e-commerce and traditional trade in the context of the so-called “atoms-bits transformation” For the digital-trade world, it was more important to think about how to remove trade barriers for bits rather than atoms. Additionally, it was essential to have a better understanding of the new features of trade under the digital revolution. With regard to the second communication, contained in document JOB/DEV/46, he said that it presented major difficulties associated with e-commerce market access. These difficulties included accessibility, connectivity, and transparency. The accessibility issue addressed whether each e-commerce operator had an equal opportunity of being seen online, and thus had access to potential customers. The connectivity difficulty related to the lack of sufficient infrastructure to connect to potential buyers or sellers. The transparency difficulty referred to regulatory barriers, whereby the requirements to comply with different regulations and standards induced significant costs for e-commerce operators. He went on to stress the importance of reciprocal equal access and the removal of accessibility blocks in order to ensure greater fairness. Increasing access to ICT infrastructure was also a key factor in addressing the digital divide, while making regulations transparent were important to businesses preparing to enter into possible future markets. In closing, he indicated that the two communications were not relevant to e-commerce discussions in the context of MC11, but aimed simply at clarifying some fundamental issues relating to e-commerce, while facilitating future discussions at the WTO.","WTCOMTDM104.pdf","Chinese, Taipei, CTD, Council, for, Trade, in, Services, CTG, ICT, WTO"
"605",605,"72","72.    The representative of India recognized that e-commerce had become a major driver of international economic activity and international trade. In India, e-commerce was transforming the way business was being conducted, and represented one of the fastest growing segments of the economy. However, the growth of e-commerce activities had given birth to new challenges, both for domestic and cross-border trade. These included issues relating to consumer protection, the sale of counterfeit goods and services, the safety of online payments, e-authentication procedures and digital signatures, taxation, as well as other challenges relating to shortages of skilled manpower, human resource development and logistics. As rules on these issues were still evolving in most developing countries, his delegation believed that it was premature to discuss rule-making on e-commerce at the WTO. Instead, discussions on e-commerce should be exploratory and confined to the non-negotiating mandate of the Work Programme on Electronic Commerce. Since the WTO bodies mandated to implement the Work Programme on Electronic Commerce had highlighted a number of technical issues which still required deliberation, he believed that Members should endeavour to expedite discussions on these issues.","WTCOMTDM104.pdf","India, India, WTO, Work, Programme, Electronic, Commerce, WTO, Work, Programme, Electronic, Commerce, Members"
"606",606,"73","73.    His delegation was not in favour of setting up a horizontal mechanism such as a Working Group on E-Commerce, as this could result in a top-down approach. He highlighted the merits of the bottom-up approach reflected in the Nairobi Ministerial Decision, which called for work on e-commerce to continue based on the existing mandate and guidelines, and on the basis of proposals submitted by Members in the relevant WTO bodies. Concerning the issue of the venue for discussion, his delegation felt that the General Council was already mandated to discuss all cross-cutting issues relating to e-commerce. He pointed to the importance of not confusing the gains from e-commerce with the likely benefits of rule-making on e-commerce, as doing so could leave many Members behind. He also indicated that discussion on e-commerce in the CTD needed to focus on how to address the development needs of developing countries. In closing, he said that the existing Work Programme on Electronic Commerce was comprehensive in scope, and allowed for an examination of all trade issues relating to global e-commerce, taking into account the economic, financial and development needs of developing countries. Given that the growth of digital trade and e-commerce were technology-dependent, a critical component of discussions had to be on how to ensure an adequate transfer of technology.","WTCOMTDM104.pdf","Nairobi, Members, WTO, General, Council, Members, CTD"
"607",607,"74","74.   The representative of South Africa, on behalf of the African Group, indicated that the Group had submitted a communication contained in JOB/GC/144, which reflected the Group's views on deviating from the current structure of the Work Programme on Electronic Commerce and its exploratory nature. She urged Members to engage substantively in the ongoing process led by the Chairman of the General Council on the future of work on e-commerce.

"609",609,"76","76.   This statement, as reflected in the Minutes of the 103 rd session of the CTD, went as follows: The representative of South Africa, on behalf of the African Group, recalled that the African Group had been approaching the exploratory discussions under the Work Programme on E-commerce from a perspective that had given paramount importance to the development implications of e-commerce, taking into account the economic, financial, and development needs of developing countries. She indicated that the Group would be interested in an exchange of views and experiences on the basis of the current Work Programme on E-commerce. For the Group, the immediate priority of the Committee should be a fuller assessment of the wide-ranging disruptions that would result from the fourth industrial revolution, the growth of digital trade and e-commerce. In that respect, discussions in the CTD under the Work Programme should take up issues that would prioritize the needs of developing countries and LDCs, especially the challenges to and ways of enhancing their participation in e-commerce. For exporters of electronically delivered products, these challenges included, inter alia, the improvement of access to infrastructure and transfer of technology, as well as the movement of natural persons.","WTCOMTDM104.pdf","CTD, South, Africa, African, Group, African, Group, Work, Programme, Group, Group, Committee, CTD, Work, Programme"
"610",610,"77","77.    She went on to suggest that discussion on e-commerce should be framed around measures that foster inclusion and equitable development for all developing and least developed countries. Specifically for the African Group, critical areas of interest for future discussion on e-commerce included the reality of increasing digital inequality, the importance of digital rights, the existing extremely high market concentration levels in the current global e-commerce space, and the range of attempts at a national level to shape digital flows in order to influence trade and affect national digital catch-up. Addressing these issues would help African governments explore their own policy options, with a view to achieving Africa’s longstanding developmental objectives of industrial development, structural transformation and employment, in the context of the profound changes brought on by the so-called ""Fourth Industrial Revolution"".","WTCOMTDM104.pdf","African, Group, Africa"
"611",611,"78","78.    The representative of South Africa indicated that the tabling of submissions in the CTD was in line with paragraph 1.1 of the 1998 Work Programme, and consistent with paragraph 1 of the Nairobi Decision on e-commerce. She said that continental integration, structural transformation and industrialization were the overriding priorities for Africa, as had been laid out by African Trade Ministers. She made reference in this regard to the Continental Free Trade Area (CFTA), as well as to Agenda 2063: The Africa We Want, and emphasized the need for work undertaken at the multilateral level to support Africa’s continental integration agenda. With regard to e-commerce, she said that the African Group approached the exploratory discussions under the 1998 Work Programme from a perspective that gave paramount importance to the development implications of e-commerce, taking into account the economic, financial, and development needs of developing countries. In this light, she believed that several issues that were included in the proposals under consideration were better suited for discussion in the CTG, the CTS or the TRIPS Council. Furthermore, some of the issues fell outside the scope of the 1998 Work Programme, or were being taken up extensively in other international organizations. She urged the proponents to refine their proposals in order to make them specific to the body where discussions should take place, as per the Work Programme.3","WTCOMTDM104.pdf","South, Africa, CTD, Nairobi, Africa, Continental, Free, Trade, Area, Africa, African, Group, CTG, CTS"
"612",612,"79","79.    She went on to say that the African Group wanted the CTD to take up issues that placed at their centre the needs of developing countries and LDCs. She highlighted in this regard the importance of addressing ways of enhancing the participation of developing countries in e-commerce, and the associated challenges. A number of examples were provided, including with respect to infrastructure, industrialization and workforce skills. It was noted that the potential benefits of e-commerce for developing countries could not be assumed or asserted. It was pointed out, inter alia, in this regard that fixed broadband penetration remained at 0.7% in Africa and the LDCs, and Africa was the only region in the world where broadband penetration remained below 20%. Bringing about socially equalizing effects would not be possible when only some had access to digital technology – whilst others had partial or no access, and also had no rights over the technology. According to the UNCTAD, four countries accounted for 80% of business-to-business (B2B) e-commerce, which was the largest form of e-trade. With regard to business-to-consumer        3          The points in this paragraph, and the following two paragraphs, were originally made at the 101 st Session of the CTD. They were subsequently reflected in the Minutes of the 103rd Session at the request of the delegation of South Africa.

Accordingly, discussions in the CTD had to address the asymmetrical nature of the existing global e-commerce space, in order to enable Africa to become e-commerce ready. One of the overriding questions of the African Group was how to build an inclusive growth and equitable development trajectory for all developing countries and LDCs. She encouraged Members to share their experiences on measures employed to develop capabilities in the digital economy. In closing, she expressed the commitment of the African Group to engage in a comprehensive discussion in the CTD on all issues relating to the development implications of e-commerce.","WTCOMTDM104.pdf","African, Group, CTD, Africa, Africa, UNCTAD, CTD, South, Africa, Middle, East, Africa, CTD, Africa, Members, African, Group, CTD"

In closing her intervention, the representative of South Africa, on behalf of the African Group, highlighted some elements of the African Group's statement delivered on the March 2017 CTD meeting, and reflected above. She noted that a number of issues contained in the proposals on e-commerce would be better suited for a discussion in the other relevant bodies, such as the CTG, the CTS and the TRIPS Council. This statement also indicated that at least two submissions on e-commerce did not cover the most important elements in the Work Programme under development. Furthermore, some of the issues fell outside the scope of the 1998 Work Programme, or were being taken up extensively in other international organizations. Therefore, the proponents were urged to refine their proposals in order to make them specific to the body where discussions should take place, as per the Work Programme.","WTCOMTDM104.pdf","South, Africa, African, Group, African, Group, CTG, CTS, Work, Programme, Work, Programme"

He firstly informed Members that the factual presentation on the US' trade preferences for Nepal was circulated on 13 November in document WT/COMTD/PTA/3/1. Members would soon be invited to submit any questions they might have on this PTA, which would be considered in a Dedicated Session in 2018. With regard to other PTAs that had been notified since the establishment of the Transparency Mechanism for PTAs, he said that the situation had not substantially changed since his last report. In particular, there were five PTAs for which the Secretariat had still not received the full set of data or information required for the preparation of factual presentations. These were the PTAs being implemented by China, India, the Russian Federation, Thailand and Chinese Taipei. He urged the notifying Members to provide the required data and information as soon as possible. In closing, he repeated what he had said earlier concerning the informal consultation convened on 2 October 2017 with the Members that had yet to submit the full set of data or information regarding the RTAs and PTAs they had notified. In particular, he recalled that representatives from the Secretariat were present at the consultation to clarify the data and information requirements, and to answer any questions. He once again expressed his hope that the consultation had proven useful, and that it would help to expedite the submission of the required data and information.","WTCOMTDM104.pdf","Chairman, Members, CTD, Members, US, Nepal, Members, PTA, Secretariat, China, India, Russian, Federation, Thailand, Taipei, Members, Members, Secretariat"

The Chairman said that the Bali Decision on DFQF market access for LDCs, contained in documents WT/MIN(13)/44 and WT/L/919, instructed the CTD to continue to annually review the steps taken to provide Duty-free and Quota-free (DFQF) market access to the LDCs, and report to the General Council for appropriate action. To aid in the review, the Secretariat was instructed to prepare, in close coordination with Members, a report on Members' DFQF market access for LDCs, at the tariff line level based on their notifications. Accordingly, a Secretariat report on DFQF had been prepared annually since the Bali Ministerial Conference. Given that the report needed to be prepared in close coordination with Members, the practice these past years had been for the Secretariat to circulate a draft report, which was considered by Members at an informal, open- ended meeting and subsequently circulated for discussion at the last formal session of the year.","WTCOMTDM104.pdf","Chairman, Bali, CTD, General, Council, Secretariat, Members, Members, LDCs, Secretariat, Members, Secretariat, Members"
"619",619,"85","85.  However, as he had explained at the informal, open-ended meeting held on 6 November 2017, because of a divergence of views between some Members on the scope and                                          WT/COMTD/M/104                                                 - 18 - coverage of the report, the Secretariat was not able to circulate its report for consideration at the present session. In spite of the discussion that had taken place in a small-group consultation that he had convened just before the informal, open-ended meeting on 6 November, these divergent views remained. In particular, Bangladesh's position on what should be the scope and coverage of the report remained unchanged from what had been outlined at the 100th Session. The position was that references in the Secretariat report to two preference programmes being implemented by the United States – namely, the African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA) and the Caribbean Basin Trade Partnership Act (CBTPA) – went beyond the scope of the report, because these were not intended specifically or exclusively for the LDCs. Although these preference programmes had been referenced in previous Secretariat reports, Bangladesh's view was that they should henceforth not be included. The United States' position, on the other hand, was that these programmes were benefiting some LDCs. They were therefore relevant to the scope and coverage of the Secretariat report, and should be maintained. He explained that, while his informal consultations had helped to clarify Members' positions, they had not permitted the situation to be unblocked. It was for this reason that there was no Secretariat report for consideration at the present meeting. Nevertheless, an item concerning the CTD's annual DFQF review was included on the agenda, and Members could therefore have a discussion on the matter.","WTCOMTDM104.pdf","Members, Secretariat, Bangladesh, Secretariat, United, States, AGOA, Secretariat, Bangladesh, United, States, Secretariat, Members, Secretariat, CTD, Members"
"620",620,"86","86.    The representative of Bangladesh expressed disappointment that the Secretariat had not been able to circulate its annual DFQF report for consideration by the CTD. Recalling that his delegation had already shared its views on this matter in 2016, he indicated that his expectation had been that Members would have realized the importance and relevance of the observations made by Bangladesh, and would have reached consensus on the report. He reminded Members of the language contained in the Hong Kong and Bali DFQF Decisions, and indicated that the scope and objective of the Secretariat report on DFQF market access for LDCs were clear. In particular, his delegation believed that the report had to focus on the steps taken to implement these two decisions. While his delegation appreciated that some Members were providing preferential market access to groups of developing countries, which sometimes included LDCs, it was questionable whether these initiatives should be included in the Secretariat report. He believed that an important consideration in this regard was whether there was a declaration of intent in these preferential schemes to support LDCs. If there was a declaration of intent, then there might be merit in including such schemes in the report, if all Members were agreeable. However, if there was no declaration of intent to support LDCs, there was no reason to include these schemes in the report, as doing so would undermine the purpose and objective of the report. In this regard, he pointed specifically to AGOA and CBTPA, since his delegation was convinced that these schemes did not contain such a declaration of intent. Given that the purpose and objective of the report required specificity as to which schemes should be referred to, he shared his delegation's view that the report needed be prepared without a mention of AGOA or CBTPA.","WTCOMTDM104.pdf","Bangladesh, Secretariat, CTD, Members, Bangladesh, Members, Hong, Kong, Bali, Secretariat, LDCs, Members, Secretariat, Members"
"621",621,"87","87.    The representative of the United States appreciated the Chairman's efforts to try and find a solution that was acceptable to all Members. He said that his delegation could continue to accept the compromise that it had accepted in the three previous years, which was to include in a table the US' Generalized System of Preferences (GSP) programme, supplemented with additional text in a footnote which clarified the United States' preference schemes. Consideration could also be given to the possibility of deleting the acronym GSP from the title of the table, and listing the three additional US programmes – AGOA, CBTPA and the trade preferences for Nepal – in the body of the table, given that all these programmes were notified to the WTO and appeared in the Database on PTAs. However, the United States could not join consensus to approve a report that would not provide specific information on all of the US' preference programmes that had LDC beneficiaries, as doing so would be misleading and unfair. Recalling the language from the Bali DFQF Decision which instructed the Secretariat to prepare a report on Members' DFQF market access for LDCs, he stressed that the purpose of the report was to provide transparency. If Bangladesh could not stand by the previous compromise on the report, the United States would not hold itself to that compromise either. He recalled that the Bali DFQF Decision used the language ""for LDCs"", and not ""the LDCs"" or ""all LDCs"". This meant that any notified scheme that benefitted any LDC should be included not only in the text of the report, but also in the table. Additionally, his delegation would reject any proposal to include Members' opinions of other Members' schemes in a Secretariat report, as this would be inappropriate and would call into question the Secretariat's neutrality.","WTCOMTDM104.pdf","United, States, Chairman, Members, US, GSP, United, States, GSP, US, AGOA, Nepal, WTO, United, States, US, Bali, Secretariat, Members, LDCs, Bangladesh, United, States, Members, Members, Secretariat, Secretariat"
"622",622,"88","88.  The representative of the European Union recalled that the European Union provided DFQF market access for all products from LDCs, except for arms and ammunition. This made the European Union the most important destination for LDC agricultural and manufactured products.

She welcomed the progress in the provision of DFQF market access by both developed and developing Members. It was noted in this regard that most developed countries were now providing close to full DFQF market access for LDC products. Her delegation additionally welcomed the growing number of emerging economies that were providing preferential treatment to LDC products, and encouraged them to continue to do so in light of their growing importance as a destination for LDC exports.","WTCOMTDM104.pdf","European, Union, European, Union, European, Union, LDC, EU, GSP, Members"

He informed the Committee that the update had been circulated in document WT/COMTD/W/230, and invited representatives of the Economic Research and Statistics Division (ERSD) to briefly introduce the report.","WTCOMTDM104.pdf","Chairman, CTD, Members, CTD, Secretariat, Committee, Economic, Research, and, Statistics, Division"

With respect to trade developments over the 2014-2016 period, it was noted, inter alia, that developing economies' share of merchandise export and imports had declined by 1 percentage point, and stood respectively at 42.5% and","WTCOMTDM104.pdf","ERSD, Secretariat"
"629",629,"94","94.   An overview was also provided of the participation of developing economies in global value chains (GVCs), based on the data available in the Trade in Value Added (TiVA) database, which was maintained by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) and the WTO. It was explained that participation in GVCs could be broken down into backward participation – corresponding to the value added from inputs that were imported in order to produce intermediate or final goods and services for export – and forward participation, which captured the domestic value added contained in inputs sent to third economies for further processing and                                          WT/COMTD/M/104                                                 - 20 - exporting through a value chain. The GVC participation index, derived from the TiVA database, illustrated the multiple value added exchanges taking place within international production. The report provided information on the total forward and backward participation of the developing economies available in the TiVA database, as well as information on participation in the computer, electronic and optical equipment industry. The data showed that the Philippines played a major role in electronics supply chains, with 30% of its trade in that sector taking place within GVCs. In general, the countries showing the highest degree of vertical specialization had low forward participation in GVCs, which confirmed their focus on activities at the end of the information technology (IT) and electronics production chains. This was the case for East Asian economies like Malaysia, Thailand and Viet Nam, as well as for economies such as China and Mexico where processing trade was predominant. Korea and Chinese Taipei showed strong participation in IT-related GVCs, while the development of Costa Rica within GVCs was largely due to the presence of global technology corporations in the country. Among African economies in the TiVA database, Morocco was the most involved in electronics GVCs. In addition, using traditional trade statistics, it was shown that some labour-intensive final assembly activities in Asia had shifted from China to other low-cost neighbouring economies.","WTCOMTDM104.pdf","Organization, for, Economic, Cooperation, and, Development, OECD, WTO, GVC, Philippines, Malaysia, Thailand, Viet, Nam, China, Mexico, Korea, Taipei, Costa, Rica, TiVA, Morocco, Asia, China"

He noted that the report described how specific changes affected certain regions. For example, the fall in energy prices affected some regions more than others. In addition, giving examples from Africa, he observed that experiences differed even within a particular region. Finally, he observed that half of trade between developing economies was attributable to exports to other developing economies, and in this regard underlined the importance of South-South trade.","WTCOMTDM104.pdf","United, States, Secretariat, Africa"

She noted that a realistic picture of global trade could be provided through the use of the TiVA database, and pointed in particular to the snapshots of Asian value chains. She went on to say that trading was no longer about final consumer goods. Technology – particularly ICT – had expanded connectivity, and had made it possible to share information and communication in factories in different countries, and to provide services across the globe. ICT also allowed MSMEs to gain access to the global market. She recalled that, in 2017, Members had discussed these realities on various occasions – including at the Aid-for-Trade Global Review, during which many key aspects were highlighted, such as the importance of private resource mobilization, trade facilitation, digital trade, and a good regulatory environment with policy consistency and transparency. In closing, she expressed hope that this exchange of ideas and best practices would be pursued, in order to make trade more inclusive and achieve worldwide sustainable economic growth.","WTCOMTDM104.pdf","Japan, ICT, ICT, Members, Aid-for-Trade, Global, Review"

This had been done to address the request made at the 104th Session to reinstate the four-week timeframe for the issuance of meeting notices, which was laid out in the CTD's rules of procedure. He recalled that he had also explained at the informal, open-ended meeting that Members would have the opportunity to consider and comment on the proposed agenda as necessary, and that a more concrete agenda would subsequently be circulated according to the ten-day timeframe for the issuance of meeting notices – similar to what was mentioned in the General Council's rules of procedure, and in line with the practice that the CTD had been following for many years. He hoped that this approach had proven useful to Members. He went on to say that the proposed agenda for the 105th Session of the CTD was contained in document WTO/AIR/COMTD/13/Rev.1, circulated on 13 April 2018.","WTCOMTDM105.pdf","Chairman, Committee, on, Trade, and, Development, CTD, Members, General, Council, CTD, Members, CTD"

While RTA notifications made to the CTG and the CTS subsequently flowed into the CRTA, notifications to the CTD did not flow to any other body.

The representative of South Africa, on behalf of the African Group, referred to the discussion that had taken place on the Aid-for-Trade Work Programme at the CTD's reconvened 42nd session on Aid for Trade, held on 23 April 2018. In particular, she recalled that the Group had requested some more time before it would be in a position to inform Members on whether or not it could agree to relinquish its position on having a footnote in the current version of the draft Aid-for-Trade Work Programme – contained in document JOB/DEV/52/Rev.3. She observed in this regard that the document was the result of an intensive process, in the context of which even a reference to industrial policy had been rejected. Notwithstanding Africa’s long-term development objectives for industrialization and structural transformation, in the spirit of cooperation the Group had indicated that it was willing to forego a number of important issues critical to those objectives, in order to move forward with the Aid-for-Trade Work Programme. She also recalled that the Group had submitted written comments that were substantive in nature, and which intended to improve and strengthen the Aid-for-Trade Initiative. As recipients of Aid for Trade, the member countries of the African Group believed that they were in a position to identify ways to realize the objectives of the Aid-for-Trade Initiative. The comments had been provided in that spirit, and she therefore did not agree with the assertion that the African Group had politicized the Aid-for-Trade Initiative. She also expressed regret that the Aid-for-Trade Task Force recommendations adopted by the General Council on 10 October 2006 in document WT/GC/M/104 were now being called into question. She observed that it was these recommendations that gave life and form to the Aid-for-Trade Initiative, the Global Review of Aid-for-Trade and the Aid-for-Trade Work                                         WT/COMTD/M/105                                                - 18 - Programmes.

The representative of Chad, on behalf of the LDC Group, said that no feedback had been received from members of the Group calling into question the third revision of the draft Aid-for-Trade Work Programme, as contained in document JOB/DEV/52/Rev.3. He believed that improvements had been made in the current text relative to earlier ones, which emphasized the importance of industrialization, structural transformation and the development of infrastructure and skills. The current text was therefore acceptable to the LDC Group, even though certain members of the Group had wished to see further improvements. The text provided a strong basis for moving forward with the aim of fulfilling the mandate of the Aid-for-Trade Initiative, which was to help developing countries, and especially LDCs, to strengthen their supply-side capacity and trade-related infrastructure in order to increase exports.

The Chairman said that he wished to take the opportunity to summarize the current status of the draft Aid-for-Trade Work Programme, and inform Members how he intended to proceed. He recalled that, at the CTD's reconvened 42nd Session on Aid for Trade on 23 April 2018, a textual amendment was agreed to, in the form of the deletion of the word ""and"" in paragraph 1.3. However, there remained some outstanding work to do, notably with respect to paragraph 3.2. Overall, he believed that significant progress had been achieved on the text, and some Members had expressed their satisfaction with the changes made between the second and third revisions of the document. However, others had noted that there existed a limit to their flexibility. He recalled that he had posed the question to Members as to whether document JOB/DEV/52/Rev.3 would be the final draft text under his chairmanship, or whether it would a final text that would be submitted to the General Council. On this matter, it appeared that the document was to be the final draft under his chairmanship. In order to capture the progress made so far, and to facilitate the work of the incoming Chairman, he indicated that the document would now be issued in all of the official WTO languages. He clarified that the document remained a draft, and that the task of arriving at a final Aid-for-Trade Work Programme would now fall to the incoming Chairman. In closing, he observed that, at no point during the various consultations on this text, had he heard any Member questioning the utility of having an Aid-for-Trade Work Programme, or expressing a desire to discontinue the work on the Aid-for-Trade Initiative.","WTCOMTDM105.pdf","Chairman, Members, CTD, Members, Members, General, Council, Chairman, WTO, Aid-for-Trade, Work, Programme, Chairman, Member"

The first proposal – contained in document WT/COMTD/W/208 and submitted by Barbados, Belize, China, Cuba, Ecuador, India and the African Group – was for the CTD to report on the development-related work taking place in other WTO bodies. The second proposal under consideration – submitted by China, Cuba, Ecuador, India and the African Group – was contained in document WT/COMTD/W/192. In this document, the remaining proposal for consideration was for the CTD to make a recommendation for parties to RTAs to submit their notification and information requirements jointly. He went on to say that the two documents had been appearing on the CTD's agenda for several years. Despite the informal consultations held by several CTD Chairpersons, including himself, little progress had been made to date. He recalled that, at the last CTD meeting, a number of the proponents had reiterated their                                         WT/COMTD/M/105                                                -5- positions, while some other Members had reminded the Committee of their concerns with the two proposals. With regard specifically to document WT/COMTD/W/192, the proponents had indicated that they were still working towards submitting a revised document, the intention being to reflect therein only the proposal which remained under consideration. This message had also been conveyed at the informal, open-ended meeting held on 21 March 2018. He hoped that some further progress could be reported at the present meeting.       -     Committee on Trade and Development Mandate: Focal Point for Consideration and             Coordination of Work on Development in the WTO – Proposal from Barbados, Belize,             China, Cuba, Ecuador, India, and the African Group (WT/COMTD/W/208)","WTCOMTDM105.pdf","Chairman, CTD, Members, CTD, Barbados, Belize, China, Cuba, Ecuador, India, CTD, WTO, China, Cuba, Ecuador, India, African, Group, CTD, CTD, Members, Committee, Committee, WTO, Barbados, Belize, China, Cuba, Ecuador, India, African, Group"

"672",672,"20","20.    The representative of India recalled the CTD's mandate from MC8, as well as the six paragraphs in the terms of reference (TORs) of the CTD, as contained in document WT/L/46. His delegation requested information from the Secretariat on the activities carried out relating to each of these six areas over the past year. With regard to the proposal contained in document WT/COMTD/W/208, he explained that it was a simple rephrasing of the CTD's TORs. The proponents believed that it was appropriate for the CTD to report regularly on the development- related work taking place in other WTO bodies, while providing the necessary recommendations to the General Council on achieving better coordination within the WTO on development issues. He also indicated that his delegation did not understand the concerns expressed by some Members on the proposal. He suggested that these Members should go through the work carried out by the CTD in past years, and in particular in 1996. In this regard, he drew the Committee's attention to paragraph 5 of the 1996 draft report of the CTD to the General Council dated 28 October 1996, which was contained in document WT/COMTD/W/19. According to this paragraph, the Committee had agreed to review the implementation of provisions in favour of developing country Members on the basis of contributions from Members and from the WTO bodies responsible for monitoring the implementation of the Uruguay Round commitments. To assist in this exercise, the Chairman had invited the Chairpersons of other WTO bodies to submit information on how provisions in favour of developing countries had been dealt with in their respective Committees. On the basis of these responses, the Secretariat had prepared background documentation presenting the replies received in an analytical format. In closing, he explained that the proposal contained in document WT/COMTD/W/208 sought to re-start work in the CTD that had been done in the past. His delegation was open to discussions with other delegations in this regard. He requested that the sub-item concerning document WT/COMTD/W/208 be maintained on the CTD's agenda.","WTCOMTDM105.pdf","India, CTD, CTD, Secretariat, CTD, CTD, WTO, General, Council, WTO, Members, Members, CTD, Committee, CTD, General, Council, Committee, Members, Members, WTO, Uruguay, Chairman, WTO, Secretariat, CTD, CTD"

He noted that the proposal contained in document WT/COMTD/W/208 was a paraphrasing of the CTD's TORs, and that Ministers had given the instruction to fully operationalize the mandate of the CTD as a focal point for development work. He believed that following these instructions would contribute favourably to work on development in the WTO, and would enhance the credibility of the organization. Finally, he highlighted the proponents' openness to participate in small-group consultations with interested Members, and requested that the sub-item concerning document WT/COMTD/W/208 be maintained on the agenda.","WTCOMTDM105.pdf","China, India, CTD, CTD, WTO, Members"

"676",676,"24","24.    The representative of the European Union said that her delegation's understanding of the MC8 mandate was different from that of some other Members. Her delegation's view was that, in order to implement the MC8 mandate, the CTD should further explore the positive link between trade and development. This needed to be based on constructive exchanges on clearly identified topics, in line with the instruction from MC8 to carry out focused work. The proposals submitted in the context of the MC8 mandate that had previously been agreed to by the Committee responded to the requirement of being focused, and the European Union had engaged constructively in the discussions that had led to agreement. However, her delegation continued to have concerns with the proposals that remained under consideration, as they did not respond to this requirement. She indicated the European Union's openness to meet with the proponents in order to try to better understand the objectives underlying these proposals.

Canada did not believe that the CTD had the authority to require other WTO bodies to report to it, nor did it have the authority to provide recommendations to the General Council on the work undertaken by other bodies. She also observed that attempts to separate out the development-related aspects of other Committees’ work would be challenging, and might trigger a theoretical debate about what constituted development. Additionally, such an approach could create a duplicative process – which would not be desirable in light of resource constraints – and might water down discussions through the absence of technical experts from the substantive Committees. In closing, she said that the end objectives of the proposal, and what exactly would be achieved, remained unclear to her delegation.","WTCOMTDM105.pdf","Canada, Canada, CTD, WTO, General, Council"

The proponents needed to address the concerns raised by other Members – either by revising their proposals, or by dropping the proposals altogether. The sub-items concerning these proposals needed to be removed from the CTD's agenda until the proponents had something new to offer. The United States had repeatedly stated that there was no consensus for these proposals to remain on the agenda. It was not the case that there was any unfinished business to be addressed.","WTCOMTDM105.pdf","United, States, Committee, Members, CTD, United, States"

"684",684,"31","31.   The representative of India referred to the remaining proposal in document WT/COMTD/W/192, which was for the CTD to make a recommendation for the parties to RTAs to submit their notification and information requirements jointly. He said that the RTA TM provided for several notifications to be carried out by Members, party to RTAs. In order to avoid misunderstandings and to help ensure a timely consideration of RTAs, and hence the smooth operation of the RTA TM, it was important for the parties to submit their notification and information requirements jointly. Based on the suggestions by some Members, the proponents were continuing their consultations with their capitals with a view to submitting a revision of document WT/COMTD/W/192 so as to reflect only the remaining proposal. The matter of removing the other proposals from the document was being carefully considered. A particular concern in this regard related to the removal of the proposal calling for the Secretariat to update its document on the implementation of special and differential treatment (S&D) provisions in the WTO Agreements and Decisions, since there had been no update to the document since 2016. In closing, he expressed the proponents' willingness to engage in informal consultations with interested Members in order to make progress.","WTCOMTDM105.pdf","India, CTD, RTA, TM, Members, RTA, Members, Secretariat, WTO, Members"
"685",685,"32","32.   The representative of the United States said that his delegation always welcomed the opportunity to discuss the RTA TM in the CTD. With respect to the remaining proposal contained in document WT/COMTD/W/192, the United States had repeatedly indicated that this proposal                                         WT/COMTD/M/105                                                -7- suggested a diminishing of Members' substantive rights and obligations under the GATT, the GATS, and the Enabling Clause. In his delegation's view, there was no prospect for consensus on the proposal in either the CTD or the CRTA. The only outcome from the proposal would be to provide one Member with the right to prevent others from complying with their notification obligations, which would be prejudicial in the face of any dispute settlement proceedings regarding a particular RTA. The proponents had failed to address this concern. Finally, he noted that notification obligations were not embedded in the RTA TM, but rather in the GATT, the GATS and the Enabling Clause.","WTCOMTDM105.pdf","United, States, RTA, TM, CTD, United, States, Members, GATT, CTD, CRTA, Member, RTA, RTA, GATT, GATS"
"686",686,"33","33.      The representative of Canada welcomed the indication from India that the proponents were working towards submitting a revision to document WT/COMTD/W/192. She noted that India had observed in its intervention that the Secretariat paper on the implementation of S&D provisions in the WTO Agreements and Decisions had not been updated since 2016. In this regard, she recalled that the Committee had agreed that the report would be updated after two years, and her delegation was therefore expecting an update in 2018. She hoped that this would address India's concern. She also noted that Canada did not support the remaining proposal in document WT/COMTD/W/192. In her delegation's view, notifications of RTAs should remain the responsibility of individual Members, and a requirement for joint notifications risked exacerbating issues with regard to non-notified RTAs. It was also not clear how joint notifications would contribute to fulfilling the instructions from MC8 to fully operationalize the mandate of the CTD as a focal point for development work. Finally, she noted that, pursuant to paragraph 28 of the Nairobi Ministerial Declaration, the CRTA had been instructed to consider systemic issues arising from RTAs.","WTCOMTDM105.pdf","Canada, India, India, Secretariat, WTO, Committee, India, Canada, Members, CTD, Nairobi, CRTA"

"688",688,"35","35.    The representative of India said that, while he agreed with the United States that notification obligations stemmed from the GATT, the GATS and the Enabling Clause, it was the RTA TM that laid out the procedures to consider the notified RTAs. His delegation's view was that systemic issues relating to RTAs – including those addressed in the remaining proposal contained in document WT/COMTD/W/192 – needed to be discussed in the Regular Session of the CTD. However, for RTAs notified under the Enabling Clause, the implementation of the RTA TM needed to take place in the CTD's Dedicated Session on RTAs.

"691",691,"38","38.    The Chairman said that he wished to share a few observations under the present sub-item, since this was the first time that it appeared on the CTD's agenda. He recalled that, at the last meeting, a number of concerns were raised – and specific requests were made – regarding the implementation of the RTA TM in the CTD, in particular in the context of the need for closer harmonization between the practices in the CTD and the CRTA. As was the case with past CTD Chairpersons, he believed that it was in Members' interests for the CTD and CRTA to maintain similar practices, to the extent possible, in the implementation of the Mechanism. Furthermore, as CTD Chairman, he believed that it was important for him to address the concerns that had been raised. Accordingly, along the lines of the requests made – and in line with what he had explained at the informal, open-ended meeting held on 21 March 2018 – notifications of RTAs under the Enabling Clause were specifically listed on the agenda of the present meeting. He noted that a                                         WT/COMTD/M/105                                                -8- similar practice had recently started in the CRTA. In addition, his report on the status of preparation factual presentations had been circulated as a Committee document, similar to what was done in the CRTA.","WTCOMTDM105.pdf","Chairman, CTD, RTA, TM, CTD, CTD, CRTA, Members, CTD, CRTA, CTD, Chairman, CRTA, Committee, CRTA"
"692",692,"39","39.    He also recalled another concern raised at the last CTD meeting, which was that, while CRTA document symbols allowed a tracking of all subsequent documentation relating to an individual RTA from the time of notification, this was not the case in the CTD. After discussing the matter with the Secretariat, it was his understanding that notifications in the CTD – which concerned not only RTAs, but also Generalized System of Preferences (GSP) schemes and other preferential trade arrangements (PTAs) – were circulated according to the document series which had been applied since 1995. A unique number for each RTA or PTA had then been assigned for subsequent documentation – for example, factual presentations or questions and replies documents. However, to address the concern raised, it was possible for the unique number to be henceforth reflected on the notification itself. Finally, he informed the Committee that he had recently met with the Chairman of the CRTA to discuss issues relating to the implementation of the RTA TM. He believed that this meeting had been useful for both Chairs, as it had allowed them to compare practices and procedures across the two Committees, with the participation of the respective Secretariats. It was felt that periodic meetings between the two Chairs – and continued regular meetings between the respective Secretariats – should take place on issues relating to the implementation of the RTA TM. From his perspective as CTD Chairman, he had taken away from the discussion the potential need for more regular consultations with the parties to RTAs notified under the Enabling Clause. In a number of cases, for example, the full set of data or information required for the preparation of the factual presentations had not as yet been submitted. He also believed that it might be worth following up on issues relating to the implementation reports due under paragraph 15 of the RTA TM, since the CTD had not received any as yet. It would be for his successor to consider how to take some of these issues forward.

The representative of the European Union requested clarification from the parties to the MERCOSUR-SACU agreement as to why they had notified this agreement under the Enabling Clause. She indicated in this regard that paragraph 2(c) of the Enabling Clause did not cover preferential non-tariff barriers, and could not justify the elimination of such barriers among the parties to customs unions. The view of her delegation was that customs unions needed to be notified under GATT Article XXIV. She added that the agreement went beyond preferential tariff concessions, and covered areas such as technical barriers to trade (TBT), sanitary and phytosanitary (SPS) measures and safeguards. Finally, she called on Members that had notified RTAs to cooperate with the Secretariat in the preparation of factual presentations.","WTCOMTDM105.pdf","European, Union, GATT, Members, Secretariat"

He welcomed the placement of RTA notifications on the agenda, as he believed this would help enhance transparency and provide the Committee with the opportunity to comment on the regional integration efforts of Members. He also expressed support for the points raised by the European Union, and shared his delegation's view that the Enabling Clause provided only for tariff concessions. With regard to the India-Thailand agreement and the MERCOSUR-SACU agreement, he urged the parties to provide the data and information that would allow the Secretariat to prepare the factual presentations. He indicated that his delegation would consider requesting these notifications back on the agenda, if there was no progress in this regard. Turning to the Ecuador-El Salvador agreement, he observed that the agreement went beyond tariff concessions, and in this light questioned the appropriateness of notifying it under the Enabling Clause. In addition, noting that the agreement had been notified only by El Salvador, he indicated that such a notification would not be possible if the remaining proposal contained in document WT/COMTD/W/192 – discussed under the previous agenda item – were implemented. This illustrated the point made by his delegation several times, which was that it was the individual right of a Member to make a notification, and this should not be affected by a requirement to notify an RTA jointly.","WTCOMTDM105.pdf","United, States, Chairman, RTA, TM, CTD, Chairman, RTA, Committee, Members, European, Union, India-Thailand, Secretariat, El, Salvador, Member, RTA"

The representative of the United States said that his delegation's questions to Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Mexico, Paraguay, and Uruguay regarding document WT/COMTD/N/53 had been circulated in both the CTD and the CRTA. While these questions related to a notification made to the CTD, the United States felt that it was necessary and appropriate to submit this document to the CRTA as well, because the issues raised therein had been under discussion in the CRTA for some time. He said that the United States had significant concerns regarding the inconsistent implementation of the RTA TM across the two bodies, and actions taken in one Committee had implications for the other Committee. He also drew Members' attention to the European Union's questions to the LAIA member countries, circulated in the CRTA in document WT/REG/W/124. With regard to document WT/COMTD/N/53, he explained that his delegation had circulated its questions because the intent of the document was unclear, and this lack of clarity undermined the purpose of notification obligations. His delegation was seeking clarification on why the parties had chosen to deviate from Committee practice with respect to the use of the notification format, which had always been understood to relate to only one agreement under a particular document symbol. He asked whether the Members that had submitted the document were intending to notify agreements, or modifications to previously notified agreements. His delegation was raising this issue because the document contained sixteen different instruments, covering five separate agreements, which did not have the same signatories.

"702",702,"48","48.     In addition, he noted that some of the instruments referred to in the document related to RTAs that had never been notified to the WTO. In this light, his delegation did not believe that these could be considered as subsequent notifications, but instead had to be understood as notifications of the RTAs themselves, thereby triggering the process for review under the RTA TM. The document apparently aimed to serve distinctly different purposes for each of the different instruments, and his delegation therefore had difficulties accepting it in its current form. With regard to the cover note on the document, he observed that there appeared to be a conditionality applied to the submission, which indicated that the document was without prejudice to notifications submitted individually by LAIA members. This conditionality made the document meaningless, as it implied that the document had not been submitted by the parties, or that it would have no standing in the event that another document was submitted. It remained unclear to his delegation how the approach taken by the parties in document WT/COMTD/N/53 would facilitate the implementation and functioning of the RTA TM. In closing, he expressed his hope that responses to his delegation's questions would be received soon and that, through a continued dialogue, his delegation would be able to better understand the intention of the parties, and that outstanding differences of views could be resolved.","WTCOMTDM105.pdf","WTO, RTA, TM, LAIA, RTA"

He requested that document WT/COMTD/N/53, as well as his delegation's questions on the document, be maintained on the agenda. He additionally requested that the Secretariat take note of the questions and concerns that Members had raised with respect to the document, and stressed the importance of ensuring that notifications to the CTD were consistent with notifications made in other WTO bodies.","WTCOMTDM105.pdf","United, States, Brazil, Argentina, Mexico, Chile, Uruguay, European, Union, Canada, Secretariat, Members, CTD, WTO"

"713",713,"58","58.    The Chairman said that his report on the status of the preparation of factual presentations, circulated in document WT/COMTD/W/233, contained eighteen separate entries relating to the status of factual presentations to be finalized. In some cases, the full set of data had not been submitted, while in other cases not all comments on the draft factual presentations had been received. He urged all the parties to these agreements to provide to the Secretariat the required data and information as soon as possible. He also informed Members that there remained one RTA notified under the Enabling Clause that had not been ratified by all the parties. This was the Pacific Island Countries Trade Agreement (PICTA). Following CRTA procedures, a factual presentation on PICTA would only be drafted after the agreement had been ratified by all the parties. The parties to PICTA were urged to inform the Secretariat as soon as all ratifications were completed.","WTCOMTDM105.pdf","Chairman, Secretariat, Members, RTA, Pacific, Island, CRTA, PICTA, Secretariat"
"714",714,"59","59.   He went on to say that he wished to make a few observations about the three RTAs which had been notified under both the Enabling Clause and GATT Article XXIV, and which had been referenced on the CTD's agenda for many years. As he had indicated at the informal, open-ended meeting on 21 March 2018, he believed that it was important to keep track of where things stood with regard to the preparation of the factual presentations on these three RTAs in the context of the CTD. This was why his report included entries relating to the ASEAN-Korea and India-Korea agreements. However, the GCC Customs Union was not referenced in his report because, as he had informed the Committee at the informal, open-ended meeting held on 21 March 2018, the factual presentation on this agreement had already been circulated. In particular, the factual presentation was circulated on 21 March with the CTD document symbol WT/COMTD/RTA/9/1, and the CRTA document symbol WT/REG276/1. He added that, in his discussion with the CRTA Chairman that he had referred to earlier, issues relating to the RTAs notified under both provisions were touched upon. This was one area where both Chairs believed that they should maintain close contact. In closing, he encouraged continued engagement among Members in order to find a way forward in the CTD with regard to the issues relating to the RTAs notified under both the Enabling Clause and GATT Article XXIV.","WTCOMTDM105.pdf","GATT, CTD, CTD, India-Korea, GCC, Customs, Union, Committee, CTD, CRTA, CRTA, Chairman, Members, CTD, GATT"
"715",715,"6","6.     A representative of the Development Division recalled that the appearance of notifications of RTAs on the agenda of the CTD's Regular Session had initially been requested by a Member at the 104th Session. Subsequently, at the informal, open-ended meeting held on 21 March 2018, the Chairman had explained to Members how the notifications would be reflected on the agenda, on the basis of the requests made. Guidance would therefore be required from Members on the way forward in this regard. He also observed that, under the current practice, Dedicated Sessions on RTAs were not convened frequently. Only eight such sessions had been held to date. If the objective of listing RTA notifications on the agenda was to regularly take note of them, from a practical point of view it would be difficult to do so in the Dedicated Session, if the current practice were maintained.","WTCOMTDM105.pdf","Development, Division, CTD, Member, Chairman, Members, Members, RTA"
"716",716,"60","60.   The representative of the United States believed that it was useful for Members to have the Chairman's report circulated as a Committee document in advance of the meeting. He expressed his delegation's continued concerns about the delays in the preparation of factual presentations, and urged Members to provide the required data or comments to the Secretariat. He highlighted in particular his interest in receiving an update on the India-Nepal agreement and also noted, in response to the earlier intervention by South Africa, that the deadline for the submission of data on the MERCOSUR-SACU agreement had already passed.","WTCOMTDM105.pdf","United, States, Members, Chairman, Committee, Members, Secretariat, India-Nepal, South, Africa"

The Committee took note of the Chairman's report, and of the interventions made.       -     Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) Notification of Customs Union – Communication from             China, Egypt and India (WT/COMTD/W/175)","WTCOMTDM105.pdf","Committee, Chairman, Gulf, Cooperation, Council, GCC, -RRB-, Notification, of, Customs, Union, China, Egypt, India"
"718",718,"62","62.   The representative of India indicated that his intervention related not only to the present sub-item, but also to the two following sub-items. He noted that the systemic concerns raised by China, Egypt and India over the legal and procedural implications of the dual notification of the GCC Customs Union under both the Enabling Clause and GATT Article XXIV were pertinent even now, but remained unaddressed. He recalled that, on 19 November 2007, the GCC Customs Union was notified to the CTD under the Enabling Clause. This notification was discussed in the CTD under ""Other Business"" at the 69th, 70th, 71st, and 72nd Sessions held respectively in May, July, October and December 2008. Since the 73rd Session held in March 2009, the notification of the GCC Customs Union had been discussed under the agenda item ""Notifications under the Enabling Clause"". The sub-item concerning the GCC Customs Union notification was introduced at the request of a developed Member, over concerns that the notification had been made exclusively on the basis of the Enabling Clause. Some developed Members did not favour moving forward with the process of reviewing the GCC Customs Union in the CTD until there was further clarification on the legal justification for such a procedure. The GCC Customs Union was later notified to the CRTA under GATT Article XXIV on 6 October 2009.                                         WT/COMTD/M/105                                               - 12 -","WTCOMTDM105.pdf","China, Egypt, India, GCC, Customs, Union, GATT, GCC, Customs, Union, CTD, CTD, GCC, Customs, Union, GCC, Customs, Union, Member, Members, GCC, Customs, Union, CTD, GCC, Customs, Union, CRTA, GATT"
"719",719,"63","63.    He went on to say that the CTD had not as yet reached a consensus on the issue of the notification and consideration of the GCC Customs Union – notwithstanding the justifications provided in support of the notification made under the Enabling Clause, and despite the assertion by the CTD Chairperson in October 2008 that the GCC Customs Union was scheduled for factual consideration at a CTD dedicated session. Instead, the subsequent notification under GATT Article XXIV was deemed by some developed Members as the legal premise for examining this RTA in the CRTA. Some developing Members had raised systemic concerns over the legal and procedural implications of the dual notification of the GCC Customs Union to both the CTD and the CRTA, and the undertaking to refer the agreement to the CRTA. These systemic concerns impinged upon the mandate and the terms of reference the CTD, as well as on the Enabling Clause, the RTA TM, and the rights and obligations of Members in a manner that extended to the realm of strengthening the multilateral trading system (MTS) and its development dimension as highlighted by the Seventh WTO Ministerial Conference. In closing, he requested that the three sub-items remain on the agenda until the systemic and specific concerns arising out of the ""dually notified"" RTAs were addressed.","WTCOMTDM105.pdf","CTD, GCC, Customs, Union, Chairperson, GCC, Customs, Union, GATT, Members, RTA, CRTA, Members, GCC, Customs, Union, CTD, CRTA, CRTA, CTD, RTA, TM, Members, WTO"
"720",720,"64","64.   The representative of China expressed support for the intervention by India.

"722",722,"66","66.    The representative of the European Union said that her intervention related to the present sub-item, as well as to the two following sub-items. With regard to the GCC Customs Union, her delegation noted with appreciation that the factual presentation and the Secretariat's general incidence calculation had been circulated, and that a fax had been sent to Members announcing that a review would take place in the CRTA. Turning to the ASEAN-Korea and India-Korea agreements, she said that it was important to clarify the legal and procedural questions arising from agreements being notified by each party under different legal provisions. With respect to the ASEAN-Korea agreement, she regretted that no progress had been made, and encouraged the parties to make additional efforts in this regard. She noted that this situation had prevented the Committee from reviewing the goods aspects of the agreement, whereas the services aspects had already been discussed in the CRTA. She also regretted that no progress had been made regarding the India-Korea agreement, and again encouraged the parties to make additional efforts to find a solution.","WTCOMTDM105.pdf","European, Union, GCC, Customs, Union, Secretariat, Members, CRTA, India-Korea, Committee, CRTA, India-Korea"
"723",723,"67","67.    The representative of the United States said that the GCC Customs Union notification concerned a customs union, and this made this particular notification different from non-customs union RTA notifications. With regard to document WT/COMTD/W/175, he noted that his delegation had not found any specific issues relating to the notification of the GCC Customs Union. The co-sponsors of the document appeared to be seeking a discussion of a systemic nature on RTAs, which was outside the scope of the CTD. Any systemic discussion on the rules for RTAs needed to take place in the CRTA.","WTCOMTDM105.pdf","United, States, GCC, Customs, Union, RTA, GCC, Customs, Union, CTD, CRTA"
"724",724,"68","68.   The Committee took note of all interventions.       -     Notification of the Agreement on Trade in Goods between the Association of Southeast             Asian Nations (ASEAN) and Korea","WTCOMTDM105.pdf","Committee, Association, of, Southeast, Asian, Nations, ASEAN, Korea"
"725",725,"69","69.   The representative of the United States welcomed the inclusion of this sub-item on the agenda, and noted that a correct listing would need to include the document symbol WT/COMTD/N/33, which was the ASEAN member countries' notification of 6 July 2010. Although this notification should have initiated the review process set out in Section C of the RTA TM – thereby providing transparency regarding the preferential treatment extended by the parties – the review process had not been initiated, because some of the parties had still not submitted the required data to the Secretariat. Referring to the RTA TM, he noted that data needed to be made available within 10 weeks – or 20 weeks in the case of RTAs involving only developing countries – after the date of notification of the agreement. However, in the case of the ASEAN-Korea agreement, almost eight years had passed since the notification. It was his understanding that data remained outstanding from Cambodia, the Philippines and Viet Nam. He urged these parties                                         WT/COMTD/M/105                                                - 13 - to provide the necessary data to the Secretariat without any further delay. He also observed that Lao PDR, which was a member of ASEAN, had not been identified as a party to the ASEAN-Korea agreement in the notification of 6 July 2010. In this regard, he requested clarification as to whether Lao PDR was a party to the agreement – and if so, whether it would submit a notification, and subsequently the necessary data to the Secretariat. Finally, he noted that some Members had raised questions regarding the venue for the mandated review of the ASEAN-Korea agreement. While it was important to reach a consensus on a path forward for the review, his delegation did not believe that the question of venue should be a reason for Members to avoid fulfilling their obligations under the RTA TM.","WTCOMTDM105.pdf","United, States, ASEAN, RTA, Secretariat, RTA, TM, Cambodia, Philippines, Secretariat, ASEAN, Lao, PDR, Secretariat, Members, Members, RTA"
"726",726,"7","7.     The representative of the United States, in response to the intervention by India, said that his delegation, when requesting the RTA notifications on the agenda, had also had to give some thought as to where these notifications should be placed. He indicated that his delegation was flexible in this regard. One possibility might be to maintain the notifications under the agenda item ""Notifications under the Enabling Clause"", while having a separate agenda item concerning the implementation of the RTA TM, which would include the Chairman's report on the status of factual presentations and any other relevant issues. He added that, while the RTA TM laid out a procedure to follow after an RTA was notified, the actual notification requirement came from the Enabling Clause. He also observed that the Dedicated Sessions on RTAs were convened only once a factual presentation was ready, and the frequency of these meetings was not sufficient to allow the Dedicated Session to regularly address notifications and issues relating to the implementation of the RTA TM.","WTCOMTDM105.pdf","United, States, India, RTA, RTA, TM, Chairman, RTA, RTA, RTA"
"727",727,"70","70.    The representative of Korea said that issues relating to dual notifications of RTAs had appeared on the CTD's agenda for several years, and that his delegation had engaged in discussions with interested Members, and with CTD Chairs, with a view to resolving the matter. He indicated that Korea had duly notified its RTAs – and in particular the ASEAN-Korea and India-Korea agreements – in accordance with GATT Article XXIV and GATS Article V, and in compliance with the RTA TM. While the Enabling Clause was designed to allow developing Members to accord differential and more favourable treatment in tariffs to each other, he was unsure whether the ASEAN-Korea and India-Korea agreements fell into this category. In this regard, he expressed some doubt on having separate considerations of the two agreements in the CRTA and in the CTD, but indicated that his delegation was open to the possibility of handling the matter in a joint meeting of the two bodies.","WTCOMTDM105.pdf","Korea, CTD, Members, Korea, India-Korea, GATT, RTA, Members, India-Korea, CRTA, CTD"

The representative of the United States welcomed the inclusion of this sub-item on the CTD agenda as a reminder of the outstanding data that was due for the preparation of the factual presentation on the India-Korea agreement.

"730",730,"73","73.     The representative of India indicated that his intervention related not only to the present sub-item, but also to the previous two sub-items. Referring to elements of document WT/COMTD/W/175, he noted that it had been argued that the non-adoption or prescription of criteria or conditions for the elimination of non-tariff measures (NTMs) did not exclude customs unions providing for the elimination of non-tariff measures from the coverage of the Enabling Clause, nor should this impair developing Members' rights in taking such actions within their RTAs. In this regard, he shared his delegation's view that customs union among developing countries could be notified under the Enabling Clause, and that the Enabling Clause covered more than just tariffs. He believed that Members needed to consider the legal and procedural implications of notifying the GCC Customs Union on the basis of the Enabling Clause and GATT Article XXIV, without either notification being withdrawn. Members also needed to consider the role of the CTD and the CRTA in reviewing an RTA notified under both provisions. He additionally pointed to the question of how the CTD should deal in the future with RTAs between developing Members that were notified under the Enabling Clause, insofar as this related to the fulfilment of paragraphs 1 and 4 of the CTD's TORs. Another issue was whether a Member could notify an RTA under a specific legal provision unilaterally – without the consent of the other parties to the RTA – and whether a notification could be made on behalf of all the parties to the RTA under another legal provision. Furthermore, the implications arising from Members retaining a notification under the Enabling Clause – but not conducting a factual consideration of the RTA in the CTD – needed to be addressed, as did the question of how this would figure specifically in the case of the GCC Customs Union, where a factual review had been scheduled.","WTCOMTDM105.pdf","Members, Members, GCC, Customs, Union, GATT, Members, CTD, CRTA, RTA, CTD, Members, CTD, Member, RTA, RTA, RTA, Members, RTA, CTD, GCC, Customs, Union"

"732",732,"75","75.   The Chairman said that he had circulated a report, contained in document WT/COMTD/W/234, on the status of the preparation of factual presentations on PTAs. In summarizing the information in the report, he informed the Committee that, as had been mentioned in past meetings, there were five PTAs that had been notified since the establishment of the Transparency Mechanism for PTAs (PTA TM) for which the Secretariat had still not received the full set of data or information required for the preparation of the factual presentations. These were the PTAs being implemented by China, India, the Russian Federation, Chinese Taipei and Thailand. In addition to statistical data that was missing, it was his understanding that, for at least some of these PTAs, up-to-date regulations in an official WTO language had not been notified to the CTD, as was required under the PTA TM. Without these regulations, the Secretariat would not be in a position to complete the factual presentations – even if the statistical data were submitted. He therefore urged the notifying Members to provide all the required data and information as soon as possible. In closing, he said that this was the first time that the CTD Chairperson's report on the status of PTA factual presentations had been circulated as a Committee document. He recalled that he had indicated at the informal, open-ended meeting of the CTD's Regular Session on 21 March 2018 that he would proceed in this manner, as he believed this would be useful for Members.","WTCOMTDM105.pdf","Chairman, Committee, Secretariat, China, India, Russian, Federation, Taipei, Thailand, WTO, CTD, Secretariat, Members, Chairperson, PTA, Committee, CTD, Members"

The concern related to the listing on the agenda of the notifications of the agreements between India and Thailand, MERCOSUR and SACU, MERCOSUR and Egypt, and Ecuador and El Salvador, as these related to the implementation of the RTA TM.

Under this item, delegations had provided information on the steps they were taking, or had already taken, to provide DFQF market access to LDCs.

"740",740,"82","82.   The representative of Chad, on behalf of the LDC Group, emphasized the importance of DFQF market access for the integration of LDCs into the MTS, as well as for their growth and development. The LDC Group appreciated the efforts of those developed Members that were providing DFQF market access on all of their tariff lines – or on at least 97% of their tariff lines, pursuant to the Hong Kong DFQF Decision – as well as the efforts of developing Members in this                                          WT/COMTD/M/105                                                 - 15 - regard. However, he noted that DFQF implementation had not led to the significant impact on LDC exports that had been hoped for. Certain Members whose markets were of fundamental importance to LDC exports had yet to provide duty-free access on at least 97% of their tariff lines. Furthermore, in some cases, the remaining 3% of tariff lines subject to duties often included products of export interest to LDCs – for example, textiles, clothing and certain agricultural and industrial    products.   According      to    the   Secretariat    Note   contained    in   document WT/COMTD/LDC/W/65/Rev.1, the average applied tariffs by developed Members in 2015 on textile and clothing products from LDCs were 3.2% and 6.5%, respectively. He also noted the infrastructural constraints that LDCs had to deal with in their efforts to export their products. While stressing the importance to LDCs of enhanced DFQF market access, he also called for an in-depth analysis of the problems faced by LDCs. He believed in particular that an examination of the utilization of preferences at the tariff line level would help to determine where to focus discussions in order to help increase LDC exports. In this regard, he recalled that the LDC Group had submitted a proposal in 2016, contained in document WT/COMTD/W/218/Rev.1, for a clinical examination of DFQF implementation. Some Members had been reluctant at the time to agree to the draft TORs for the proposed study. He stressed that the proposal aimed simply for the preparation of a technical study by the Secretariat, in order to allow an understanding of what was preventing LDCs from taking fuller advantage of the preferences granted, and to come up with the best possible responses. He expressed his hope that Members could agree to the proposal.","WTCOMTDM105.pdf","Chad, LDC, Group, MTS, LDC, Group, Members, Hong, Kong, Members, LDC, Members, LDCs, Secretariat, Members, LDCs, LDCs, LDC, Group, Members, Secretariat, Members"

He noted that, while the objective laid out in the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development was to double the LDCs' share of global exports by 2020, the LDCs' share had actually decreased in recent years. He urged Members to agree to the draft TORs submitted by the LDC Group for a clinical examination of DFQF implementation. He also expressed disappointment that, at a recent meeting of the Committee on Rules of Origin, delegations had not provided updates on the steps taken to implement the Nairobi Decision on preferential rules of origin for LDCs. He called on Members to consider the spirit of the Hong Kong and Bali DFQF Decisions, as well as the Nairobi Decision on preferential rules of origin, and to faithfully implement these Decisions in order to help LDCs increase their share of global exports.","WTCOMTDM105.pdf","Bangladesh, Chad, LDCs, Members, LDC, Group, Committee, on, Rules, of, Origin, Nairobi, LDCs, Members, Hong, Kong, Bali, Nairobi"

He highlighted that the Decision called, inter alia, for a continuation of the work under the Work Programme on E-Commerce, based on the existing mandate, with an endeavour to reinvigorate the work. In this context, he recalled that the CTD was one of the four subsidiary bodies of the General Council that was mandated to implement the Work Programme on E-Commerce. On the basis of the MC11 Decision, he invited Members to consider possible ways forward for the CTD in the e-commerce area, and to share any ideas with the Committee. He also indicated that, as per the MC11 Decision, the General Council would hold periodic reviews on the Work Programme on E-Commerce, based on reports submitted by the relevant WTO bodies. The next review would take place at the July 2018 session of the General Council.","WTCOMTDM105.pdf","Chairman, Members, Ministerial, Decision, WTO, Work, Programme, Work, Programme, CTD, General, Council, Work, Programme, Members, CTD, Committee, General, Council, Work, Programme, WTO, General, Council"
"745",745,"87","87.   The representative of Chinese Taipei welcomed the decision taken at MC11 to continue the work on e-commerce. His delegation stood ready to contribute to this work, and to help build a more inclusive and fair MTS. He indicated that he wished to introduce two submissions by his delegation, circulated in February 2018 in documents JOB/DEV/53 and JOB/DEV/54. With regard to the first submission, he said that e-commerce provided a unique opportunity for micro, small and medium-sized enterprises (MSMEs) to reach out and engage in the global market. However,                                         WT/COMTD/M/105                                               - 16 - cyberspace trade barriers (CTBs) – which were interventions by governments in the cross-border transmission of information by electronic means – had a restrictive effect on international trade. His delegation's view was that the CTB issue deserved greater attention, since overcoming the digital divide and CTBs were key preconditions for MSMEs to connect online and access potential local and foreign buyers. He went on to say that the second submission contained his delegation's observations on the 3D printing revolution and the sharing economy. He noted that the rapid advent of 3D printing and demander-supplier matching services were creating new kinds of e-commerce manufacturing and trading patterns, which often by-passed traditional border controls. He suggested that Members should consider these issues, in order to address possible asymmetric regulatory treatment. In closing, he indicated that his delegation was willing to share more in-depth analysis in the e-commerce area, and to join in capacity-building efforts. He expressed hope that the two submissions from his delegation would help to clarify important dimensions of e-commerce, and facilitate discussions on e-commerce, development and capacity-building in the WTO.","WTCOMTDM105.pdf","Taipei, CTB, Members, WTO"
"746",746,"88","88.   The representative of Bangladesh suggested that a dedicated session of the CTD could be held in May 2018 to discuss e-commerce, for which the Secretariat could prepare a background paper on the key elements relating to the CTD under the Work Programme on E-Commerce. He also proposed that the second submission introduced by Chinese Taipei could form part of the discussion, particularly with regard to the revenue implications of e-commerce. He hoped that the Committee could agree at the present meeting to hold a dedicated session.","WTCOMTDM105.pdf","Bangladesh, CTD, Secretariat, CTD, Work, Programme, Taipei, Committee"
"747",747,"89","89.   The representative of the European Union said that her delegation was supportive of discussions in the e-commerce area.

"748",748,"9","9.      The representative of the United States said that his delegation had requested the listing of RTA notifications on the agenda in order to conform to established practices in the WTO. In this regard, he explained that notifications under GATT Article XXIV were listed on the agenda of the Council for Trade in Goods (CTG), while notifications under GATS Article V were listed on the agenda of the Council for Trade in Services (CTS). These notifications were subsequently transmitted to the CRTA. He believed that the CTD had a role to play in ensuring the smooth functioning of the RTA TM, but also stressed once again that the notification requirement did not stem from the RTA TM itself, but rather from the Enabling Clause. He additionally indicated that he was unclear about India's position on this matter, given that India had been requesting for many years the appearance on the Regular Session agenda of the notifications concerning the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) Customs Union, the agreement between the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) and Korea, and the agreement between India and Korea. He believed that it was important to be consistent with regard to the reflection of RTA notifications on the agenda.","WTCOMTDM105.pdf","United, States, RTA, WTO, GATT, Council, for, Trade, in, Goods, CTG, Council, for, Trade, in, Services, CRTA, CTD, RTA, TM, RTA, India, India, Gulf, Cooperation, Council, GCC, Customs, Union, Association, of, Southeast, Asian, Nations, ASEAN, Korea, India, Korea, RTA"

The representative of Bangladesh, in response to the intervention by the European Union, said that he did not see the need to submit a written proposal on his suggestion for a dedicated session on e-commerce to be held. He explained that the elements of his suggestion – including the proposal for a Secretariat background paper, and the idea to address parts of the submission by Chinese Taipei – were already contained in the Work Programme on E-Commerce. He called for a discussion on substance rather than on procedure. Holding a dedicated session on e-commerce would allow the Committee to provide a substantive report to the General Council at its July 2018 meeting.","WTCOMTDM105.pdf","Bangladesh, European, Union, Secretariat, Taipei, Work, Programme, Committee, General, Council"

"752",752,"93","93.   The representative of India recognized that e-commerce had become a major driver of international economic activity and international trade. In India, e-commerce was transforming the way business was being conducted, and represented one of the fastest growing segments of the economy. However, the growth of e-commerce activities had given birth to new challenges, both for domestic and cross-border trade. These challenges were well highlighted at the E-Commerce Week organized by the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) on 16-20 April 2018, and included issues relating to consumer protection, the sale of counterfeit goods and services, the safety of online payments, e-authentication procedures and digital signatures, taxation, as well as other challenges relating to shortages of skilled manpower, human resource development and logistics. As rules on these issues were still evolving in most developing countries, his delegation believed that it was premature to discuss rule-making on e-commerce at the WTO. Instead, discussions on e-commerce should be exploratory and confined to the non-negotiating mandate of the Work Programme on E-Commerce, as agreed by Ministers at MC11. The bodies mandated to implement the Work Programme on E-Commerce had highlighted a number of technical issues within the scope of the relevant WTO Agreements which required deliberation. He also shared the view that a distinction needed to be made between the gains from e-commerce, and the likely benefits of rule-making on e-commerce. With regard to work that could be undertaken in the CTD, he pointed to the elements laid out in paragraph 5.1 of the Work                                          WT/COMTD/M/105                                                 - 17 - Programme on E-Commerce, and stressed that discussions on e-commerce in the CTD needed to focus on how to address the development needs of developing countries. A critical component of this discussion should be on how to ensure an adequate transfer of technology, given that the growth of digital trade and e-commerce was technology-dependent.","WTCOMTDM105.pdf","India, India, E-Commerce, Week, United, Nations, Conference, on, Trade, and, Development, UNCTAD, WTO, Work, Programme, Work, Programme, WTO, CTD, CTD"

Discussions in this regard had already been held at the mini-Ministerial meeting held in New Delhi in March 2018, and some informal exchanges were currently taking place in Geneva. His delegation saw value in continuing free and frank dialogue on the subject, and therefore wished to make its own contribution to facilitate the process by organizing a Member-driven activity. Details of the format and content of the activity were still under reflection, although the preliminary feeling was that a workshop or seminar would be useful, with the participation of external experts such as academics. His delegation had been consulting informally with some Members about the possibility of holding such an activity, possibly before the summer break, and looked forward to hearing the views of the wider membership. Japan remained open to continue discussing this matter with any interested delegation.","WTCOMTDM105.pdf","Japan, Members, New, Delhi, Geneva, Members, Japan"

The Chairman said that the underlying reasons for the review presently underway was to encourage greater integration of developing and least-developed countries into the world economy. For many least-developed countries, the act of joining the WTO was one of faith.

He also cautioned that this Committee should not attempt to cut across the work of other Committees and should avoid going into detailed requirements. His informal note was intended as the basis on which recommendations to the General Council could be formulated. As time was short, he urged delegations to submit their views in writing.

However, recalling that the Marrakesh Declaration related to technical cooperation for developing countries, he said that his delegation continued to have difficulties with the guidelines referring to economies in transition. These countries had access to funds from sources such as the EBRD. Furthermore, technical assistance was in response to demand and this might be difficult to reconcile with the objective of keeping a geographical balance. He wondered how the exchange of information with donor and recipient governments would take place: whether this would be done through notification or otherwise, for example through an exchange of experiences in the course of a discussion. He wondered which non-governmental organizations were intended as sources of funding for WTO technical assistance trust funds. He cautioned that some organizations had their own agendas.","WTCOMTDM11.pdf","Egypt, Chairman, Committee, Chairman, EBRD, WTO"

In the section on modes of delivery he suggested an editorial change to the first indent so that it would read ""extending assistance on as broad and as cost-effective a basis as possible"". He agreed with the representative of Egypt that the section on bilateral development assistance in trade-related matters should clarify the modalities of information exchange between donor and recipient governments as well as any role of the WTO.

His delegation had always stressed the importance of elaborating evaluation criteria at the outset. He agreed that the purpose of technical assistance was to further integrate countries into the multilateral trading system. He pointed out that economies in transition had received and continued to receive technical assistance. It was not for the CTD to discuss whether this should or should not be so. Rather, the Committee should stick to its mandate to establish guidelines which would be applicable to WTO technical assistance programmes.

The representative of Singapore suggested that the document specify at the outset that technical assistance was for developing countries but could be extended to economies in transition in that category.

He also suggested that the phrase ""where relevant"" be added in the paragraph on non-governmental organizations, to accommodate the concern expressed in that respect.","WTCOMTDM11.pdf","Singapore"

In that context, he suggested that the guidelines provide for the analysis and evaluation of potential contributors.","WTCOMTDM11.pdf","Colombia, Egypt"

With regard to the concerns expressed in relation to NGOs as a possible sources of funding, he recalled that the guidelines gave the CTD a supervisory role which would include matters such as this. He intended to sent a new draft of the guidelines to delegations at an early stage. He was hopeful that the guidelines could be adopted at a next meeting of the CTD and that such guidelines would contribute to helping recipient countries receiving the maximum benefit from WTO technical assistance.","WTCOMTDM11.pdf","Chairman, CTD, CTD, WTO"

"791",791,"28","28.      The Chairman recalled that the Committee had an exchange of views at its two previous meetings on the basis of a study prepared by the Secretariat, contained in document WT/COMTD/W/15. The study was intended to constitute the basis for addressing one of the three issues the Committee had selected for its priority work programme in 1996. Based on this study, he suggested that the Committee start identifying specific inputs for the preparatory process for the Ministerial Conference. In the Committee's discussions, attention had been drawn by delegations to the link between fluctuations in world interest rates and exchange rates on volumes and values of developing countries exports, as well as to the impact of outstanding debts on trade performance. Delegations had raised the issue of the negative effects of tariff escalation, combined with declining commodity prices, on the export performance of developing countries. Matters relating to domestic savings, foreign investment and development had also been raised. He also recalled that the Committee on Trade and Development and the Sub-Committee on Least-Developed Countries were required by their terms of reference to consider measures and initiatives to assist developing and least-developed countries in the expansion of their trade and investment opportunities. Discussions in both Committees had been held on the basis of a Secretariat's document outlining recent initiatives in these areas. In this context, the significance of investment for economic development and for the integration of developing countries into the global economy had been raised, more than once. It seemed therefore that initiating an educative process on these issues, for instance on existing investment rules, should be considered carefully. The merits of such an approach appeared to be recognized, judging by the work undertaken on this matter by other international instances, fro example UNCTAD. A possible forum for discussion in the WTO could be the Committee on Trade and Development. He suggested that, for example and as a first stage, one could consider taking up a review of existing bilateral or plurilateral investment programmes, in order to explore their nature and the mechanisms and results achieved from a WT/COMTD/M/11 Page 6 development perspective. The problems involved were complex and needed to be studied from different angles. This would ensure that the complementary nature of the work undertaken in WTO and in other fora, such as UNCTAD would be maximized. UNCTAD and WTO could examine the issue from different view points. He emphasized that any involvement in an educative and analytical process on investment did not constitute the start of a process of negotiation on a multilateral investment agreement in the WTO. Delegations should go slowly and not jump fences. This would form an additional argument in favour of selecting the Committee on Trade and Development as the appropriate forum within the WTO for carrying out such an educative process, as the CTD was not negotiating forum.","WTCOMTDM11.pdf","Chairman, Committee, Secretariat, Committee, Committee, Committee, Committee, on, Trade, and, Development, Secretariat, UNCTAD, WTO, Committee, on, Trade, and, Development, WTO, UNCTAD, UNCTAD, WTO, WTO, Committee, on, Trade, and, Development, WTO, CTD"
"792",792,"29","29.      The representative of Canada said he was uncertain about the reason for the Chairman's statement. It had not addressed exhaustively the issues raised by delegations, such as the importance for developing countries of the development of the services sector, which had been raised by his delegation. The Chairman's statement relating to the investment issue and the link he had made to the CTD was of particular interest. His delegation supported the idea to launch work on investment in the WTO. Such work should include a review of existing agreements, economic analyses and an examination of the rules on investment in regional trade agreements. While he recognized that the CTD's terms of reference required it to take a horizontal look at all issues, he could not agree at this stage that the CTD was the appropriate body to discuss investment issues. He recalled that the investment issue was currently being discussed in the forum of the Heads of Delegations and that it should, at least for the time being, more appropriately remain there.","WTCOMTDM11.pdf","Canada, Chairman, Chairman, CTD, WTO, CTD, CTD"

The Chairman clarified that the terms of reference of the CTD required it to consider measures and initiatives to assist developing country Members, and in particular the least-developed country Members, in the expansion of their trade and investment opportunities, including support for their measures of trade liberalization. It was his intention at this stage to get reactions from delegations. Investment was a key issue under discussion in the forum of the Heads of Delegations.

The representative of the European Communities said that investment was an issue which concerned both developed and developing countries and consequently needed a larger perspective than that of the CTD.

Neither did such a consensus exist on how the WTO would, post-Singapore, deal with investment related issues. He was however concerned that a number of delegations who in the forum of the Heads of Delegations were in favour of discussing investment did not wish to do so in the CTD. It was clear that the CTD could not be the forum for negotiations on investment. He could however appreciate the usefulness of discussions outside a negotiating framework, for instance those of an analytical nature, in the CTD. He was of the view that the door should not be closed to the possibility of discussing investment in the CTD, along the lines of the Chairman's suggestion. It would be premature to rule out the possibility of discussing an integral element in the development process. It was clear that any discussion on investment in the CTD would not preempt strategic decisions on the role and place of investment on the future agenda of the WTO.

The Chairman said that his intention had been to draw the attention to the CTD's area of competence, pursuant to its terms of reference, independently of decisions taken elsewhere. He drew a parallel with the way in which regional trade agreements were handled in the WTO. To consider the role of RTAs in the development process was unrelated to negotiations of individual RTAs or to their conformity with multilateral obligations.","WTCOMTDM11.pdf","Chairman, CTD, WTO"
"801",801,"37","37.     The representative of Switzerland said that while discussion on an important subject such as investment should not be ruled out on a prima facie basis, he was of the view that to introduce issues which were currently under discussion elsewhere would be an unwise diversion from the useful work carried on in the CTD. He could well see that, at some stage, the CTD could usefully consider investment issues from a development perspective.","WTCOMTDM11.pdf","Switzerland, CTD, CTD"

The representative of Venezuela referred to the perspective put forward by the Chairman and agreed that it was within the CTD's mandate to consider the total spectrum of WTO issues. He questioned the utility of analytical work on development issues if investment was excluded.

The representative of Singapore agreed with the view expressed by the representative of the United States that it would be premature to exclude any discussion of investment in the CTD. Investment was within the CTD mandate and in that context, he drew attention to paragraph 5 of document WT/COMTD/W/15 which noted the importance of private capital flows for economic growth and the very small part of it which went to least-developed countries. He suggested that the CTD should focus its discussion on the role of investment in the further integration of developing and least-developed countries into the world economy, rather than to link it up with the Heads of Delegations' process.","WTCOMTDM11.pdf","Singapore, United, States, CTD, CTD, CTD"

"808",808,"43","43.      The Chairman then turned to the draft Comprehensive and Integrated WTO Plan of Action for the Least-Developed Countries and drew attention to the need to ensure that least-developed countries secured a share of international trade commensurate with their economic development and their effective participation in the world trading system. On two occasions, their concerns were reflected in formal instruments containing elements in favour of the group of least-developed countries: in the 1979 Enabling Clause, and in the 1994 Decision on Measure in Favour of the Least-developed Countries. In addition, specific supportive measures in favour of the least-developed countries had been included in many Uruguay Round agreements. The CTD and the Sub Committee on LLDC had, throughout 1996, given special consideration to their peripheral position in the world economy and in the multilateral trading system. Under each of the priority areas which were singled out for examination within the Committee, attention was to be given to the difficulties of the LLDCs. He recalled that the Secretariat had produced a document outlining recent international initiatives launched in favour of LLDC's to facilitate the expansion of their trade and investment opportunities. In addition, the study by the Secretariat contained in document WT/COMTD/W/15 which had been discussed earlier in this meeting, though not exclusively geared towards the LLDCs, gave interesting insights into the factors which might have a bearing on their economic performance, in particular their trade performance. The CTD and the Sub Committee on LLDCs had also been informed by the Heads of international organizations about their activities relating to least-developed countries. There was no doubt that efforts should not only be coordinated but should be tailored to the need of countries. Despite such efforts, little headway had been made in the integration of the least-developed countries into the world economy. At the G7 summit in Lyon, the WTO Director-General had drawn attention to the need to implement expeditiously the Marrakesh Ministerial Decision in Favour of LLDCs. The Plan of Action before the Committee incorporated the main elements of the Director-General's proposal. As a result of a series of informal consultations, he had identified other areas where positive action could be taken. Some initiatives in the plan were ready to be launched, others called for further refining and discussion in the WTO. The draft Plan of Action was a testimony to the firm commitment of WTO Members to translate into action the commitment to promote trade-related activities in the economic development of least-developed countries.","WTCOMTDM11.pdf","Chairman, Integrated, WTO, Uruguay, CTD, Sub, Committee, LLDC, Committee, LLDCs, Secretariat, LLDC, Secretariat, LLDCs, CTD, Sub, Committee, on, LLDCs, Lyon, WTO, Director-General, Marrakesh, Ministerial, Decision, Committee, Director-General, WTO, WTO, Members"
"809",809,"44","44.      The representative of Tanzania expressed great satisfaction for the Chairman's commitment which had resulted in this Plan of Action. The New York Ministerial meeting on least-developed countries, held shortly before, had called for such a plan of action to be submitted to the Singapore Ministerial. He recognized that the proposed plan had incorporated all suggestions made in the WTO as well as in other fora. However, he could not agree with the suggestion in the draft Plan of Action, that the least-developed countries had failed to take advantage of the opportunities provided to attract foreign investment. Least-developed countries did not need encouragement, but rather needed assistance. There were fundamental reasons why foreign investment was not flowing to least-developed countries and this had little to do with their failure to use opportunities to encourage FDI. He wondered why a high percentage of FDI flows was attracted by China and by east European countries and why so little went to least-developed countries despite comparable regimes for foreign investment in LLDC's. Supply side constraints and inadequate infrastructure constituted part of the problem. While an efficient service sector was a precondition for development, development banks would not come forward until efficient communications existed. There was no simple linkage between trade and investment. There were other links such as levels of aid and levels of indebtedness. In his view the UN Programme of Action for LLDCs provided a balanced picture of what should be done by the LLDCs and what should be done by the international community. The Mid-term review of this programme clearly showed how much had been done by LLDCs and how much less by the international community. A WTO draft Plan of Action should be similarly balanced. The draft Plan of Action did not focus sufficiently on supply-side constraints. It was imperative that such fundamental constraints had to be tackled before market access. He was heartened by the provision in the draft Plan of Action for country-programmes. He wanted an assurance that country programmes would deal with issues highlighted in the programme of action relating to developing, strengthening and diversifying production and export bases. He also                                                                             WT/COMTD/M/11                                                                             Page 9 emphasized the importance of defining WTO's area of competence as broadly as possible as many requirements arising from WTO agreements could be interpreted as falling outside the competence of WTO. He suggested that it would have been more appropriate in the Plan of Action's section dealing with supply-side constraints to refer to the need to facilitate the implementation of commitment in the TRIPs agreements which had provisions for least-developed countries rather than the SPS agreement. He also suggested that it would be more appropriate to provide for joint participation by the public and private sectors in training courses. He wondered whether this draft Plan of Action was the programme of action promised by the Director-General of the WTO.","WTCOMTDM11.pdf","Tanzania, Chairman, New, York, Singapore, WTO, China, LLDC, UN, Programme, LLDCs, LLDCs, LLDCs, WTO, WTO, WTO, WTO, SPS, Director-General, WTO"

He noted the caution expressed by some representatives with respect to the initiatives on market access and pointed out that such initiatives were to be considered as a positive list of options, some of which did not need to be implemented immediately. The plan was a commitment to action. He encouraged delegations to finalize a substantial Plan of Action in time for the Singapore Ministerial. This would be an important first step in efforts to increase coherence and efficiency in international actions in favour of least-developed countries. In that context he recalled that at their recent Quad meeting in Vancouver, representatives from Canada, the European Communities, Japan and the United States had recommended that a Ministerial meeting be held. The Committee might wish to consider recommending a high-level meeting next year, under WTO aegis, grouping aid agencies, multilateral financial institutions and LLDC's, with a view to building an integrated approach to the trade-related aspects of LLDCs' economic development. He welcomed views from delegations on the question as to whether the CTD in its report to the General Council should propose that such a high-level meeting be organized in coordination with relevant international organizations.","WTCOMTDM11.pdf","Chairman, Committee, WTO, Singapore, Vancouver, Canada, European, Communities, Japan, United, States, Committee, WTO, LLDC, CTD, General, Council"

He furthermore proposed the addition of the Agreement on Textiles and Clothing in the footnote to the paragraph referring to various areas in the WTO where means had yet to be elaborated to give an operational content to the special provisions in favour of developing countries.

While he agreed that documents before the Committee, including WTO/COMTD/W/15 and 16 did not give the full picture, it was important to pass the message that there had been progress. Referring to the suggestions proposed by the representative of India, he said that the role of the CTD was to look at provisions in favour of developing and least-developed countries. Reviewing an agreement such as the ATC was better left to the Textiles Monitoring Body and the Council for Trade in Goods. He agreed that more precise information was needed on the application of provisions; he cautioned however against drawing conclusions on the level of implementation on the basis of domestic legislation, since implementation of such provisions was often on a best-endeavour basis and did not need to be reflected in domestic legislation. He also cautioned that the impression should be avoided that there had been any failure on the part of members. He said that the purpose of the report was to give information on the provisions in favour of developing countries, not to express concern on any lack of their use nor to encourage their use. It was up to each Member to decide what action to take. The trade policy review seemed a case in point: least-developed countries were allowed to seek exemption from the TPRM for 7 years. However, encouraging use of this provision would deprive the 51 least-developed countries not yet subject to the TPRM the benefits of such a review. It was not within the Committee's mandate to work towards the full application of the provisions; instead, the Committee needed to disseminate the information.","WTCOMTDM11.pdf","European, Communities, Chairman, Committee, India, CTD, ATC, Council, for, Trade, in, Goods, Member, Committee, Committee"

The efforts made by developing countries to adapt legislative and administrative structures should be recognized and reflected in the Ministerial declaration. The Committee should be entrusted with a detailed analysis of difficulties faced by developing countries. There often seemed to be a lack of understanding of the provisions relating to the time frames for the implementation of the Uruguay Round Agreements, both on the part of governments and of the private sector.

He was hopeful that between this meeting and the Singapore Conference, and maybe before or during the High-Level Meeting planned for next year, some Members would be in a position to contribute more substance to the Plan of Action. This would be in line with the Committee's objective to avoid marginalization of the least-developed countries and to bring them on board, at a time when the WTO might be embarking on new areas within its competence.","WTCOMTDM12.pdf","Chairman, Chairman, Members, Committee, WTO"

The representative of the United States said that his delegation wished to express its appreciation for the Chairman's efforts in putting together not only a Report but also a Plan of Action for the Least-Developed Countries, which was a start, even though it was not necessarily satisfactory to all. The one element that was important about the Plan of Action was its integrity and credibility. The Committee had rightly avoided the inclusion of text which would have sent a message which could not be turned into realities. In that respect it was a credible Plan on which to build without creating false expectations. This was an important element of the Committee reflecting its maturity.","WTCOMTDM12.pdf","United, States, Chairman, Committee, Committee"

The Chairman proposed that the Committee, at its next meeting, planned for 25 November, set the track for the modalities of WTO technical cooperation activities in light of the newly adopted Guidelines, and start to reflect on ways to conduct its discussions on that item next year, when it might have another Chairperson. Taking up this issue at the Committee's next meeting in November would signal that Members were serious about identifying the best possible technical cooperation in WTO. He also proposed that the Committee invite UNCTAD and the ITC to contribute with a description of their respective modalities of providing technical assistance. This would enable the Committee to compare notes and would be in line with the aim of enhancing the WTO/UNCTAD/ITC institutional dialogue with a view to ensuring a coherent approach and identifying areas of competence and complementarity. In this context, he recalled that the Guidelines also called for a three-year plan for WTO technical assistance activities, similar to the three-year cycles of UNCTAD and ITC.","WTCOMTDM12.pdf","Chairman, Committee, WTO, Chairperson, Committee, Members, WTO, Committee, UNCTAD, ITC, Committee, WTO, UNCTAD, ITC"

He agreed with the European Communities concerning ideas for improving technical assistance, as discussed at various Committee meetings on technical assistance over the past year. A written, qualitative assessment by the Secretariat would therefore be helpful, even though a qualitative assessment had perhaps not been the original objective of the report. Rather, the Committee needed to be informed of which technical assistance activities had been undertaken. Nevertheless, some interesting data or analysis existed which might be included, and it would be helpful if the Secretariat could consider preparing another document some time in the next few months. Such a document would contain the Secretariat's assessment of the strengths and efficiencies of the programmes based on its experience in carrying out the programmes. Further analysis of that kind might enable the Committee to focus its efforts on the question of how to make technical assistance as meaningful as possible.","WTCOMTDM13.pdf","United, States, Committee, Secretariat, Committee, Secretariat, Secretariat, Committee"

Additionally, he saw merit in the points raised by the delegations of the European Communities and of the United States about a qualitative assessment of the activities carried out.

His delegation supported a number of points mentioned by the delegation of the European Communities. First, his delegation had received indications that the handbook on Notifications had been useful, and he thanked the Secretariat for its effort in preparing it. Second, his delegation supported the statement by the representative of the European Communities regarding the difficulties faced by the Secretariat. Thirdly, he concurred with the delegations of the United States and the European Communities, that a qualitative assessment would be useful, and could be done in a separate paper. His delegation hoped that such a paper would be ready for the next meeting of the CTD and that the item would remain on the agenda for the coming meetings so that the report would be adequately addressed by the Committee. Lastly, his delegation supported the European Communities' intervention regarding the documents and other efforts that had already been done in various countries. Further details on the specific activities which benefitted certain developing countries would be useful as these could easily be replicated at low cost once initial work was done, benefitting other developing countries, in particular, the least-developed among them. He hoped to come back with additional detailed remarks on the Report at the next meeting.","WTCOMTDM13.pdf","Egypt, Secretariat, UNCTAD, UNDP, Secretariat, Secretariat, United, States, CTD, Committee"
"850",850,"13","13.      The representative of Switzerland said he had some preliminary comments, not on technical cooperation activities undertaken at the WTO, but rather on the Report itself. In this context he supported the interventions by previous speakers and said that it would be interesting to learn about the problems and successes of the previous programmes of technical cooperation. His delegation realized that the Secretariat had followed the same format it had used in the past since previous reports had not been subject to the type of comments which had been made at this meeting. Future reports, however, could be of a different format, which would have to be agreed on, based on the year's work and follow-up. His delegation supported the idea of having a new report sometime in the next few months, following the Committee's discussions on the modalities. Particularly, the assessment and the evaluation of past programmes should be contained in such a report, as should the criteria under which the assessment of the programmes would take place. He suggested that the Secretariat prepare a more detailed report WT/COMTD/M/13 Page 4 based on the criteria it had to agree on. His delegation also supported interventions by other delegations suggesting that the agenda item be retained for the next meeting.","WTCOMTDM13.pdf","Switzerland, WTO, Secretariat, Committee, Secretariat"

He also expressed satisfaction with the work done on the manual on Notifications: it was a useful instrument for authorities and provided a basis for consultation, enabling Members to better comply with WTO obligations. Finally, the lack of a qualitative analysis in the Report was perhaps caused by a lack of contact between the countries involved and the Secretariat. Delegations, as well as the Secretariat, had an obligation to make contributions to this analysis. His government, for example, could have expressed clear appreciation if it had been asked for an assessment on the courses held in his country. His delegation would like to participate in the preparation of the qualitative analysis.","WTCOMTDM13.pdf","Argentina, Members, WTO, Secretariat, Secretariat"

The representative of Australia said, by way of preliminary remarks, that she wished to add her delegation's voice to those who had suggested that the Secretariat assess the difficulties and successes experienced over the past year. Such assessment would be useful for the Committee's discussion on modalities and the application of the technical cooperation guidelines, which the Committee would address.

As for an evaluation of the activities, he agreed with the representative of Argentina. The government beneficiaries of the technical cooperation could report on the way in which they had benefitted from the programmes carried out by the WTO. He wondered whether a distinction had been made between activities developed through the regular budget of the WTO and activities developed through the Trust Fund on Technical Activities.","WTCOMTDM13.pdf","Venezuela, Secretariat, Secretariat, Singapore, Ministerial, Conference, Argentina, WTO, WTO, Trust, Fund"
"854",854,"17","17.      The Chairman, speaking in his capacity as the representative of Morocco, thanked the Secretariat for the Report and said that there was a strong commitment to make the technical cooperation the best available. The Report covered all the activities which had been carried out by WTO in cooperation with other institutions. However, he was of the view that the Report was somewhat vague. In spite of the tables, the details pertinent to making an assessment of the situation were lacking. In some parts of the Report, it was difficult to distinguish whether an activity had been one of WTO or one of another organization, such as UNCTAD. There should be a separate section for the cases where the WTO had been invited along with the delegation of another organization, such as the UNDP, spelling out what the WTO staff had contributed to the efforts. Otherwise, the Report could give the impression that the WTO had been doing something beyond its purview and competence. The Committee had to be careful about the description of the work. There had been many queries regarding the Technical Assistance Programme for Africa. If the Committee did not agree on what the report should contain, it would not know what to expect from it. It would be a narrative document without any real use. The Committee had to make sure that the Report contained enough details of the activities and a good assessment so as to enable it to make recommendations.","WTCOMTDM13.pdf","Chairman, Morocco, Secretariat, WTO, WTO, UNCTAD, WTO, UNDP, WTO, WTO, Committee, Africa, Committee, Committee"

The Chairman recalled that at the Committee's last meeting on 31 October, he had mentioned that he intended to raise this issue at today's meeting with a view to starting the discussion on this important item and carrying it into next year. He added that the delegation of Morocco had submitted a statement in the Budget Committee on that subject and on related financial budgetary implications, contained in document WT/BFA/W/12, dated 19 November 1996. The Secretariat had provided his delegation with some answers to its questions in the Budget Committee, which were related to this subject. Since the answers did not fully respond to all the questions, his delegation would redirect its questions to the Secretariat in the future. He intended to request the Budget Committee to circulate the answers in an official document.","WTCOMTDM13.pdf","Chairman, Committee, Morocco, Budget, Committee, Secretariat, Budget, Committee, Secretariat, Budget, Committee"
"859",859,"21","21.      A representative of the Secretariat introduced the Secretariat non-paper on WTO Technical Cooperation: Implementation Modalities1 of 25 November 1996. The Secretariat's intention in presenting the non-paper had been to assist delegations in the discussions on this matter. It therefore included an indication of the different activities that had been carried out by the Secretariat in technical cooperation, without wanting to rank them according to their relative importance or level of magnitude. All modes of delivery mentioned in the document had been utilized in providing technical assistance, some in more detail, others in less, and they were all part of the material and instruments that the WTO used in dealing with the different elements of training and assistance. The relative importance depended on the request received from the different beneficiaries. The document included some elements on how technical cooperation should be organized in the future, including the establishment of a central point, a central officer or office, in the recipient country to become the focal point for communications with the WTO. An element of particular importance was that of selecting officials of beneficiary countries to be included in a programme for the training of trainers, as had been discussed and adopted in the guidelines on technical assistance, and the element relating to local expertize, also to be utilized in future technical cooperation activities at the national, regional or sub-regional levels. With respect to coordination, the Secretariat proposed that the Technical Cooperation and Training Division coordinate and administer WTO's collaboration in the area of technical assistance with other organizations, for example with UNCTAD, the ITC, the World Bank, and also at the regional and sub-regional levels. It would also be the responsibility of the Technical Cooperation and Training Division to negotiate and execute inter-agency programmes, which was a growing area in view of the fact that other organizations were increasingly seeking joint activities with the WTO. Finally, some organizations already had joint activities with other Divisions of the Secretariat, notably in the areas of customs duties, intellectual property and agriculture. The coordination of those activities would also have to lie with the Technical Cooperation and Training Division, and therefore with the CTD in the ensuing stage of supervision.","WTCOMTDM13.pdf","Secretariat, Secretariat, WTO, Secretariat, Secretariat, WTO, WTO, Secretariat, Technical, Cooperation, and, Training, Division, WTO, UNCTAD, ITC, World, Bank, Technical, Cooperation, and, Training, Division, WTO, Secretariat, Technical, Cooperation, and, Training, Division, CTD"
"860",860,"22","22.       The representative of the Secretariat continued, explaining that, regarding management, the Secretariat would work according to a three-year plan, as approved in the guidelines. The three-year plan had been qualified in the sense that the Technical Cooperation and Training Division was trying to identify the type of activities that would be included by region. This would be indicative and would be subject to specific agreement for each yearly plan. The paper had suggested that there be a deadline, both with respect to requests addressed to the WTO for technical assistance and with respect to voluntary contributions for certain types of activities, as a sample date to allow a platform for the activities of the following year. The date of 15 November was mentioned in the non-paper, but only as an indication. Another important point had been to leave an open door to accommodate, to the extent possible, new requests that would be coming while the regular plan was being applied. Finally, he wanted to emphasize that, as regards the modalities, the reporting would be done to the Committee on Trade and Development,      1          Non-paper for the Thirteenth Session of the CTD of 25 November 1996 (Job No.6474).

"861",861,"23","23.      The representative of the European Communities said that his delegation had only preliminary comments for the time being. While some interesting ideas had been expressed, the non-paper could be improved, most importantly the part on the Modes of Delivery. The same difficulty had already been encountered in the annual reports on technical cooperation of the past two years. It was essential now that the Committee discuss the modes of delivery to define, or to redefine more clearly, what was meant by each of those activities. A requesting country having to select from the instruments presented might be more confused than helped. It was important to know what was meant by a national seminar, a technical mission, or a detailed in-depth seminar. What was a special training course, a practical training programme and participation in other activities on the regional and sub-regional levels and in Geneva? It was essential to have a clear-cut definition of each of the instruments available, so that delegations could request the use of the one which would suit them best. The Committee should use its discussion to try to improve on these concepts. His delegation suggested that a section on follow- up also be included, as had been mentioned in the guidelines, but so far had not been reflected in the non-paper. It was his delegation's view that it would be useful to reformulate slightly the language on International Coordination in order to make it clear that the Secretariat would develop, negotiate, and execute inter-agency programmes for the part that related to the Secretariat.","WTCOMTDM13.pdf","European, Communities, Committee, Geneva, Committee, Secretariat, Secretariat"
"862",862,"24","24.      The representative of the European Communities continued by commenting on the section on Management in the non-paper. As the representative of the Secretariat had explained, the section contained some useful ideas, but preference should be given to establishing a certain deadline so that the Secretariat would be in a better position to plan the activities for the year ahead. It would also be useful if the requests for technical assistance were accompanied by justifications. A request should not only be for a seminar to be organized in a certain capital, but should also contain a justification on why that specific seminar was necessary for that country. That would also assist the Secretariat in acquiring a better knowledge of the difficulties of individual WTO Members. Finally, he suggested that the point which indicated that all the requests and contributions should be addressed through the Division on Technical Cooperation and Training should appear earlier in the paper, probably as the first sentence in the section on Management, to set the terms of what followed next.","WTCOMTDM13.pdf","European, Communities, Secretariat, Secretariat, Secretariat, WTO, Members, Division, on, Technical, Cooperation, and, Training"
"863",863,"25","25.     The representative of Canada said that it was unclear how the relationship between the Technical Cooperation and Training Division and the line Divisions within the WTO worked. It was clear that the Technical Cooperation and Training Division was the coordinating Division, but the delivery seemed to be done primarily through the line Divisions. Perhaps a more detailed explanation of how that delivery mechanism worked should be included in the section on Management, in the next version. He agreed with the representative of the European Communities that, all requests should go through the Technical Cooperation and Training Division. He did not know if that was the current practice. For instance, in case a particular country wanted aid on dispute settlement issues, were requests addressed to the Legal Division? He would appreciate information on such procedures as well as on the question of who approved the technical assistance activities.","WTCOMTDM13.pdf","Canada, Technical, Cooperation, and, Training, Division, WTO, Technical, Cooperation, and, Training, Division, Technical, Cooperation, and, Training, Division"
"864",864,"26","26.     The representative of Argentina drew attention to the point on flexibility in carrying out technical cooperation. This was important and should be preserved in the exercise. Secondly, his delegation had some doubts as to how the ""Modes of Delivery"" exercise would fit with the guidelines already drawn up. While the guidelines exercise had been long, it had resulted in setting the parameters for technical cooperation. His delegation did not see the merits of negotiating Modalities in a way that would reproduce the exercise of negotiations on guidelines. The section of the text dealing with long- term engagements included some commitments the States would need to take on in order to receive technical cooperation; that part should not necessarily be interpreted as a prerequisite in order to receive technical cooperation. For example, it referred to the desirability of establishing a ""focal point"" in                                                                             WT/COMTD/M/13                                                                             Page 7 a country. That should not be a prerequisite conditioning the actual receipt of technical cooperation. If the Committee was going to advance along those lines, it needed to be explicit. Perhaps it would be more useful to keep the text as a sort of indicative non-paper, which the Secretariat could use in future work as a guide for the preparation of annual reports.","WTCOMTDM13.pdf","Argentina, States, Committee, Secretariat"
"865",865,"27","27.      The representative of Uruguay said that he fully agreed with what had been said by the representative of Argentina and wished to underscore a couple of points. First, the greatest virtue of the discussion and of the non-paper was the fact that they were general. His delegation agreed with the ideas stated by the representative of the European Communities, to the effect that it might be interesting to know, in general, what each one of the subjects meant, without reaching a dictionary-type definition that could become taxing and restrictive. One positive aspect of technical cooperation was that it was not restrictive, but rather it adapted to the needs of each country requesting the assistance. His delegation was not calling for a negotiated text, which would be restrictive in nature. Because countries often did not need one specific modality, but rather a combination of different ones or aspects of them, it would be good to build in sufficient flexibility. South-South cooperation was very useful, as one often could learn more easily from what others suffered than from top-down, professor-to-student instruction. That was what was being done on the regional level, so maybe regional experience should be considered in the future.","WTCOMTDM13.pdf","Uruguay, Argentina"
"866",866,"28","28.      The representative of Switzerland said that because his delegation had received the non-paper rather late, it would comment on it in more detail at a later stage. It seemed a good basis for elaborating the implementation modalities. To achieve the aims set out in the guidelines for WTO technical cooperation, it was imperative that such modalities be developed by the Committee and that they be sufficiently helpful and precise, so that the Committee could set up a type of technical cooperation which would benefit both donors and recipients, and, indeed, the image of the WTO. There were some errors which further work could correct to make the modalities more precise. First, more thought needed to be given to the operation of the WTO Trust Fund. Pursuant to Section 24C of the guidelines for WTO technical cooperation, which stipulated that ""the WTO Trust Fund shall be managed according to the recommendations contained in the Decision taken by the General Council of 18 July 1996 and to the financial regulations and financial rules of 5 August 1996,"" it was now necessary to establish specific rules for the management of the WTO Trust Fund for Technical Cooperation. One idea would be for the Fund to be composed of two parts - an earmarked part and a non-earmarked part. The non- earmarked contributions could be used for any activities and projects appearing in the WTO's three-year plan for technical cooperation, and earmarked contributions could be used for particular projects, which could be chosen by the donor from the lists of projects appearing in the three-year plan. Another issue needing reflection concerned the role and the range of donors who might contribute to the WTO Trust Fund.","WTCOMTDM13.pdf","Switzerland, WTO, Committee, Committee, WTO, WTO, Trust, Fund, WTO, WTO, General, Council, WTO, Trust, Fund, for, Technical, Cooperation, WTO, WTO, Trust, Fund"

Section 1 of the guidelines provided that WTO technical cooperation activities ""be administered by the Secretariat and reviewed by Members, in accordance with operational directives and implementation modalities, to be established by the Committee on Trade and Development,"" while in Section 24C, the guidelines called for ""monitoring and evaluation by the Committee on Trade and Development, based on annual evaluation of the results of technical assistance activities, in order to ensure optimum use of resources, according to appropriate evaluation criteria."" In his delegation's view, those operational directives and evaluation criteria needed to be elaborated by the Committee based on existing documents, such as the ITC Manual on Programming, Project Design, Monitoring and Evaluation. Section 22 of the guidelines provided for ""follow-up of individual programmes and assessment of their effectiveness."" It would probably not be necessary to evaluate every single project, but all major projects and programmes should be evaluated and exposed according to internationally recognized procedures and criteria. Such an evaluation should take place no sooner than one year after the end of the project or programme, to allow an assessment of the sustainability WT/COMTD/M/13 Page 8 of the benefits. In this context, he reminded delegations of the Committee's intention to develop a format for the reports by the Secretariat.","WTCOMTDM13.pdf","Switzerland, WTO, Secretariat, Members, Committee, on, Trade, and, Development, Committee, on, Trade, and, Development, Committee, ITC, Committee, Secretariat"
"868",868,"3","3.       The Chairman recalled that, in the airgram convening the meeting, Members had been invited to notify to the Secretariat information relevant to the Committee's review of this agenda item, in time for circulation and consideration at this meeting. Notifications had been received from Japan, circulated in document WT/COMTD/N/2/Add.2 and 3, New Zealand, circulated in document WT/COMTD/N/5/Add.1, and the Latin American Integration Association circulated in document WT/COMTD/7.","WTCOMTDM13.pdf","Chairman, Members, Secretariat, Committee, Japan, New, Zealand, Latin, American, Integration, Association"
"869",869,"30","30.      The representative of Switzerland continued, saying that the third point concerned international coordination. Section 23 of the guidelines provided for a ""close institutional dialogue with other international organizations, in particular with ITC and UNCTAD, and with other regional institutions to ensure a coherent approach to identify areas of competence and complementarity."" His delegation would be grateful if the Secretariat would inform the Committee about any recent steps taken towards such a dialogue, particularly in view of the high-level meeting planned for 1997 in the context of the WTO Action Plan for the Least-Developed Countries. The Secretariat could be asked to prepare an outline of the necessary steps for the implementation of that part of the guidelines and of the possible role of the CTD in both the process and the high-level meeting. He emphasized that the ideas just expressed were very preliminary and that the guidelines contained other provisions which required further elaboration, as had been pointed out by other delegations. His delegation planned to present its ideas in writing to the Committee, and to participate actively in the work required, since his Government attached great importance to those issues and hoped that the Committee would continue its efforts to carry out effective WTO technical cooperation activities to meet the essential needs of recipients. His delegation hoped that further work would be undertaken and that the item would remain on the agenda.","WTCOMTDM13.pdf","Switzerland, ITC, UNCTAD, Secretariat, Committee, WTO, Secretariat, CTD, Committee, Committee, WTO"
"870",870,"31","31.      The representative of Egypt thanked the Chairman for his efforts from the start of the process regarding technical cooperation, including those regarding the guidelines earlier in the year. It appeared that the Committee was on the right track. To start working on the Implementation Modalities was a step that had been foreseen in the guidelines, and hence, his delegation welcomed the start of the discussions. However, like other delegations, his delegation had received the non-paper only recently, and thus had not had time to study it. Regarding the Modes of Delivery, he shared some of the concerns raised by the delegation of the European Communities. His delegation was nevertheless pleased to see various modes of delivery listed, since in the past, concentration seemed to have been on seminars as one of the most important modes of delivery, even though other modes of delivery would perhaps have been more suitable for some of the purposes. It was a valid point that certain modes of delivery would require some refinement and improvement. Secondly, he shared the concern raised by the delegation of Argentina regarding the establishment of a focal point. Egypt had established different focal points and enquiry points, in accordance with various WTO provisions. Those arrangements were under the purview of different authorities, which had different areas of competence. Thus it was unclear how the new ""focal point"" would affect the competence of various organizations and authorities within Egypt's Government. His delegation wished to reflect on the idea more to determine whether it would be feasible to have the new focal point, or whether it would create an additional level of bureaucracy that might not be needed at that point in time. Regarding international coordination, there were several joint programmes of cooperation with other international organizations. His delegation sought clarification on the question of how those joint projects would be evaluated, since they sometimes fell within the competence of more than one organization, which made their assessment and evaluation, as well as their reporting to different bodies, a difficult task. The Chairman had referred to that point earlier, regarding the Tripartite Technical Cooperation Programme for Africa. His delegation would welcome more details in that respect. As mentioned by the delegation of Canada, the relationships between the different Divisions in the WTO were unclear, in terms of the delivery of technical cooperation programmes. Members also needed to clarify the roles of different Committees within the WTO regarding technical cooperation, in view of a certain overlap in activities related to technical cooperation in different Committees. Thus, the modalities should include language on the need to clarify the distribution of the workload and the division of labour among Divisions and also among the various Committees in the WTO machinery. His delegation also supported the suggestion by the representative of Switzerland to send comments in writing to the Secretariat, which could be included in a second version of the non-paper for discussion at the CTD's next meeting. A paper prepared for the evaluation of technical cooperation would assist the Committee in its work to refine the                                                                               WT/COMTD/M/13                                                                               Page 9 implementation modalities. His delegation intended to send specific comments to the Secretariat regarding the non-paper.","WTCOMTDM13.pdf","Egypt, Chairman, Committee, Argentina, Egypt, WTO, Egypt, Chairman, Tripartite, Technical, Cooperation, Programme, Africa, Canada, WTO, Members, WTO, WTO, Switzerland, Secretariat, CTD, Committee, Secretariat"
"871",871,"32","32.     The representative of Côte d'Ivoire said that the initiative concerning technical cooperation was consistent with WTO's intention to help countries participate fully. The non-paper was a good basis for the discussion, and it had been improved by the comments of delegations. Her delegation was of the view that those countries benefitting from technical cooperation should be required to contribute by submitting reports, to allow better transparency. Comments from countries themselves could help to improve the programme over the years. Her delegation wished to thank the Secretariat for all the technical cooperation activities it had undertaken - including those it had undertaken cooperatively with other organizations - despite the fact that it had only limited resources. There had been a seminar in Côte d'Ivoire, and the feedback had been positive. Her delegation also wished to thank those countries which, despite financial difficulties, contributed to the programme. Finally, she thanked the European Communities for financing the Abidjan Seminar, which had brought together African countries.","WTCOMTDM13.pdf","WTO, Secretariat"
"872",872,"33","33.       The representative of Venezuela said that he agreed with the representative of Argentina regarding the nature of the non-paper and its relationship to the guidelines that had already been formulated by the Committee. It was a document basically for information. Although it was informal in nature, its drafting implicitly suggested certain conditionalities, as illustrated by the representative of Argentina, for example, in the area of the designation of a focal point, or enquiry point. The document could be improved through incorporating suggestions such as those made by the representatives of Canada and the European Communities, which would enable a country using it to have a better idea of what had been done in the area of technical cooperation, and how programmes had been delivered and organized. Also, while his delegation had listened with great interest to the comments put forth by the delegation of Switzerland regarding the Trust Fund for Technical Cooperation, it wanted to exercise caution. The Committee needed to contemplate the impact which the Fund might have on other programmes that were already existing, such as the one in the ITC, which had windows to channel the contributions received for cooperation. Those activities should not be impaired by activities planned in this body.","WTCOMTDM13.pdf","Venezuela, Argentina, Committee, Argentina, Canada, European, Communities, Switzerland, Committee, ITC"
"873",873,"34","34.      The representative of Madagascar congratulated the Chairman on the dynamic way in which he had worked to accelerate the discussions and the implementation of the programme of technical cooperation. The programme was important for the least-developed countries, such as Madagascar. His delegation wished to express satisfaction with the quality of the technical cooperation it had been receiving from the WTO Secretariat on a number of occasions. In 1996 alone, seminars had been organized in Madagascar on the implementation of the Uruguay Round Agreements, and in Abidjan, as well as the Meeting for Ministers of Least-Developed Countries held in Geneva for the preparation of the Singapore Meeting, in addition to other meetings for delegations from LLDCs. Delegations could only be pleased with the current level of technical cooperation provided by the WTO. Nevertheless, given the international environment and its imperatives, improvement and acceleration were needed. He was thus thankful that the Chairman had put the issue on the agenda of the Sub- Committee, thereby giving it a certain level of priority.","WTCOMTDM13.pdf","Madagascar, Chairman, Madagascar, WTO, Secretariat, Madagascar, Uruguay, Abidjan, Geneva, WTO, Chairman, Sub, -, Committee"
"874",874,"35","35.      The representative of Madagascar continued, saying that the non-paper merited in-depth analysis. His delegation would provide a written analysis at a later stage. It was important to consider the match between supply and demand for technical assistance, and to place a certain level of responsibility on the beneficiary countries receiving such technical assistance. A country first needed to define its own needs. On the basis of those needs, the Secretariat could then explain the extent to which it was in a position to respond. One could not ask donors, however generous and willing, to finance something that had not been well-structured or defined. Regarding specific aspects of the non-paper, he suggested that the date of 15 November, which had been set as a deadline for requests for technical cooperation, could be advanced by a couple of months to allow donors to communicate views about what had been WT/COMTD/M/13 Page 10 requested by the beneficiary country. This would be for the purpose of facilitating donations. Regarding the question of international and inter-institutional coordination, it was common knowledge that those Members receiving technical assistance had great difficulty in defining their problems. They were aware of the problem of integration in international trade and a general need for technical assistance, but, due to the overlap and duplication among various organizations and the difficulties in distinguishing their special capabilities, countries sometimes approached an inappropriate organization. The WTO could therefore assist such countries in better understanding the capabilities of each organization, so as to refine their requests. The WTO should not just supply technical assistance, but should also have an advisory role, so that countries approaching the WTO would know how to find solutions to their problems. The WTO had this type of incident at the Meeting for Ministers of Least-Developed Countries in preparation for the Singapore Ministerial Conference. For example, the WTO sometimes had to turn down a request for technical assistance, since it was not within its competence. In such instances, countries still had a problem and needed some response. If the WTO was not able to provide the assistance, perhaps it could advise countries where to go for such assistance.","WTCOMTDM13.pdf","Madagascar, Secretariat, Members, WTO, WTO, WTO, WTO, Singapore, WTO, WTO"
"875",875,"36","36.     The representative of Korea said that it was important to establish criteria to evaluate which means of technical cooperation activities were effective. Referring to statements made by the Swiss and Egyptian delegations concerning international cooperation, he noted that similar kinds of technical cooperation funds in the WTO, UNCTAD and ITC existed. To be cost-effective, it might perhaps be possible to implement a type of coordination, such as regular consultations with the relevant organizations. Such a framework could include running lists of countries receiving technical assistance. By identifying the countries and specifying their needs, cooperation among the relevant organizations might be promoted.","WTCOMTDM13.pdf","Korea, WTO, UNCTAD, ITC"
"876",876,"37","37.      The representative of the Secretariat said that he wished to comment on the issue raised by the delegate of Canada, on the coordination of requests for technical cooperation and on the planning and the execution of those requests. As indicated in the non-paper, the Technical Cooperation and Training Division was the focal point for the contacts between the Secretariat and the delegations in the area of technical cooperation, as well as for the organization of activities related to technical assistance. However, there was no doubt that, in certain cases, there were countries which made requests directly to the operational Divisions in charge of a specific subject or type of activity. The Secretariat had been trying to coordinate to avoid duplication, with a view to establishing a clear programme of activities performed by the different Divisions. When a particular request was made, the operational Divisions and the Technical Cooperation and Training Division designed certain steps. In many cases the Secretariat staff participating in those activities did not work in the operational Division concerned with that specific subject, but still took on some responsibility in activities performed abroad because it was well informed on the subject. There was, therefore, a coordinating role for the Technical Cooperation and Training Division. The Report which delegations had considered earlier surveyed the technical cooperation activities performed by the Secretariat, and as such showed that there was a clear knowledge in the Secretariat of the various activities that were being carried out by the different Divisions.","WTCOMTDM13.pdf","Secretariat, Canada, Technical, Cooperation, and, Training, Division, Secretariat, Secretariat, Technical, Cooperation, and, Training, Division, Secretariat, Technical, Cooperation, and, Training, Division, Secretariat, Secretariat"
"877",877,"38","38.      The Chairman said that he was of the view that the Committee needed to stress that it had only just begun its work on the establishment of modalities for the technical assistance of the Organization. It was better to move the process steadily because what the Committee ultimately sought was to ""get its money's worth"", obtaining the best technical assistance possible for the Members, particularly for the developing and least-developed countries. As some delegations had emphasized, the effort of clarification and transparency was essential if the Committee wanted to attract additional voluntary contributions. The Committee needed to communicate to donors how the money would be allocated and the impact it would have.","WTCOMTDM13.pdf","Chairman, Committee, Committee, Members, Committee, Committee"
"878",878,"39","39.      The Chairman then referred to the question raised by the representative of Canada, concerning the relationship between the Technical Cooperation and Training Division and the other Divisions.

For instance, if there was a need for technical assistance in making notifications, would the Division dealing with notifications handle the substance, while the Technical Cooperation and Training Division coordinated the work? It was a question demanding attention as the Committee considered what kind of Technical Cooperation and Training Division it wanted, entailing important budgetary implications as well as the size of each Division. UNCTAD's Technical Cooperation Division had a different shape from that of the WTO; UNCTAD's arrangement might be a useful source for determining what would be optimal for the WTO in order to deliver the best technical assistance, and, as such, should be on the Committee's agenda.","WTCOMTDM13.pdf","Chairman, Canada, Technical, Cooperation, and, Training, Division, Committee, Technical, Cooperation, and, Training, Division, Technical, Cooperation, and, Training, Division, Committee, kind, of, Technical, Cooperation, and, Training, Division, UNCTAD, Technical, Cooperation, Division, WTO, UNCTAD, WTO, Committee"
"879",879,"4","4.       The representative of the United States said that he had some brief information concerning the status of his country's legislation on the Generalized System of Preferences (GSP). According to its most recent renewal, signed into law on 1 October 1996, its expiration would be 31 May 1997; WT/COMTD/M/13 Page 2 the President would seek reauthorization for the GSP at the beginning of the next Congress, convening in January 1997. The programme allowed for the refund of customs duties dating back to 1 August 1995, provided proper documentation was submitted. Furthermore, the U.S. Executive branch had the legal authority to extend the GSP product coverage for LLDCs only while the current GSP legislation was in effect. During the coming months the U.S. Executive branch would review the product coverage and certain exclusions in that regard. The next legislation would probably be different from that which was currently in effect.","WTCOMTDM13.pdf","United, States, GSP, Congress, U.S., GSP, LLDCs, U.S., Executive"
"880",880,"40","40.      The Chairman continued, referring to a point raised by the delegation of Switzerland and others. There was perhaps merit in establishing a guide on technical cooperation at the WTO - in other words, a booklet that would outline the basic scheme and explain the different modes of delivery of technical assistance. He had proposed that the WTO have more regional seminars, where people were introduced to the work of the Organization, before it provided the more substantive technical assistance. The basic scheme should introduce the concept of flexibility that had been elaborated by the representatives of Venezuela and Uruguay. The scheme should be described in the booklet on technical assistance, so that people would know what was available and what the different possibilities were. In that way they would be able to make their own requests, and not just go for the easiest option, which was to participate in seminars or to provide for officials to come to Geneva for training. Here, also, the Committee needed to make sure that when people came to Geneva, the training was more practically oriented. The WTO should not give them lectures, which they could get in their own countries or universities, but rather offer them practical training.","WTCOMTDM13.pdf","Chairman, Switzerland, WTO, WTO, Venezuela, Uruguay, Geneva, Committee, Geneva, WTO"
"881",881,"41","41.      The Chairman said that a third element for future discussion by the Committee entailed the many questions that had been raised by the delegation of Switzerland, concerning the WTO Trust Fund. The Committee also needed to make sure that its monitoring and evaluation procedures were clear. Dates for the evaluation and review were to be set in advance. The Committee on Trade and Development should have special meetings regarding those issues. In his opinion, there should be a small group within the Committee on Trade and Development to do preparatory and other work for the meeting on evaluation, to prevent that meeting from resulting only in discussion which did not yield results. The criteria for the evaluation, a subject raised by the Swiss delegation, represented the fourth item to be discussed. One aspect that had been mentioned was the idea of having the Technical Cooperation and Training Division do its Report to the Committee each year according to some basic elements agreed to in advance. There could be certain sections, including one on the internal evaluation of programmes.","WTCOMTDM13.pdf","Chairman, Committee, Switzerland, WTO, Trust, Fund, Committee, Committee, on, Trade, and, Development, Committee, on, Trade, and, Development, Technical, Cooperation, and, Training, Division, Committee"
"882",882,"42","42.      The Chairman then said that his final point concerned cooperation, a subject which had been mentioned by many delegations. Here, also, the Committee needed to be very careful. As Committee Chairman, he had had many contacts with the heads of the ITC and UNCTAD, Mr. Bélisle and Mr. Ricupero, respectively. Those contacts were geared toward ensuring a certain coherence between the guidelines and modalities, which the Committee was working on, and the activities of those other institutions, which would facilitate the execution of common programmes. The Committee needed to make sure that its guidelines and modalities were not too different from theirs, taking into account, of course, each organization's specificity. He had understood from his conversations with them that they were aware of that point and that they would cooperate with the WTO. Against this background, he proposed that the Committee invite them to give their views at its next meeting, planned for 30 January 1997. He would be presiding over the Committee for the last time, taking just a few minutes to hand the role of Chairman over to his successor. At that meeting, with the Committee's approval, he could invite the ITC's and UNCTAD's Technical Cooperation Divisions to give the Committee their views on how they themselves conducted technical cooperation activities.

"883",883,"43","43.      The Chairman concluded by saying that, while many of the LLDCs had the impression that the WTO was either an aid agency or a development agency, it was neither. They seemed to come to the WTO for help. Because they identified their problems but did not identify the institutions that should deal with their problems, an integrated approach was necessary when they came to Geneva. Availability of representatives of the three organizations to help them and the existence of common programmes of the three organizations, would solve the problem of identifying the institutions, which would make a difference to LLDCs. He clarified that he was not of the view that the WTO could address issues that were not within the purview of its competence. That was why the Committee had attempted to include the concept of international cooperation in its guidelines, so that it could direct the countries that needed help in subjects outside WTO competence to other institutions in Geneva which handled those issues. Finally, some work needed to be done regarding the organization of a high-level meeting between the three institutions, as proposed in the Committee's Report to the General Council. As Chairman of the Committee which made and accepted the proposals, he had taken the initiative of making preliminary contact with the heads of the other two institutions, to inform them that the meeting was scheduled to take place, and to ask them for their cooperation. It was his understanding that Mr. Ricupero was directing his own Secretariat to start thinking about the best contributions UNCTAD might make to this high-level meeting, and that Mr. Bélisle would be doing the same. He had also consulted with the Director General of the WTO. He invited the delegation of Switzerland to come forward with its contribution on modalities as soon as possible. The delegation of Morocco would also make a contribution on the modalities, probably before the end of the year. He thanked the Secretariat for its efforts, which would constitute a good basis for further work.","WTCOMTDM13.pdf","Chairman, LLDCs, WTO, WTO, Geneva, WTO, Committee, WTO, Geneva, Committee, General, Council, Chairman, Committee, Ricupero, Secretariat, UNCTAD, Bélisle, Director, WTO, Switzerland, Morocco, Secretariat"

The Chairman said that he wished to take the opportunity of the final CTD meeting which he was chairing to thank the Development Division for providing him with support and ideas. He also thanked all the delegations and said that the year had been a good one. He had always found a spirit of cooperation from them all. It was the way the Committee should continue to work in the future.","WTCOMTDM13.pdf","Chairman, CTD, Development, Division, Committee"

That document completed the information for 1996 and complemented an earlier report submitted to the Committee in May, in document WT/COMTD/W/14, and Add.1 in June of the same year.  8.      The representative of Switzerland regretted that the annual report on technical cooperation had been distributed only shortly before the meeting. The representative of the Secretariat said that the late distribution of the document was caused by the heavy workload in the Secretariat in preparation for the Singapore Ministerial Conference. The representative of Uruguay said that, while it would be useful to receive documentation earlier in the future, he understood the reasons for the delay.","WTCOMTDM13.pdf","Chairman, Secretariat, Committee, Switzerland, Secretariat, Secretariat, Singapore, Uruguay"
"889",889,"9","9.       The representative of the European Communities said that his delegation would have preferred to receive the document at an earlier stage but several improvements had been made over the years. His delegation had some suggestions for the future. Regional seminars should be encouraged in the future. It was a cost-effective method that promoted a better understanding of the different countries and also a better understanding among officials of each others' difficulties. He welcomed the work that had been done in compiling the handbook on Notification Obligations, which would be of use to many delegations. The Trade Policy Review Mechanism was also an element that developing countries, and particularly the least-developed, should be encouraged to undergo in the future. He recalled that his delegation had made a similar observation when discussing the Annual Report of the CTD. A trade policy review, even at an earlier date than foreseen in Annex 3 of the Agreement Establishing the WTO, was probably one of the most comprehensive forms of technical assistance that countries could get, as it obliged them to put their trade policy in order and to check, in the preparation of the reports, the levels of fulfilment of obligations. It was a useful mechanism of self-reflection for national administrations. In referring to the report on technical cooperation, he suggested that the Committee avoid limiting the assessment to only quantitative terms. It would be useful to know the Secretariat's view of the difficulties encountered. Human resources and institutional capacity building, for example, formed the main focus of the Committee's activity. What had been the result of such efforts? What difficulties did the countries have? Answers to these questions would be important, not only for determining the ordinary budget of those organizations, but also for assisting Member donor governments. If Member governments wanted to contribute on a voluntary basis, they would need to have a better understanding of what the difficulties were. It would thus be useful to have a Secretariat's qualitative assessment of the type of problems that existed and had been identified during the seminars and fact-finding missions. The Report also mentioned that: ""In addition, comprehensive                                                                             WT/COMTD/M/13                                                                             Page 3 studies on the outcome of the Uruguay Round for requesting individual countries or groups of countries, as well as background notes on specific issues in different areas of the negotiations, were prepared.""

He referred to the need for global coherence, and felt the Meeting would be an opportunity to take a bold stance by addressing policy issues in terms of both trade and finance. He felt that the CTD focused too much of its attention on issues of marginalization, market access and technical assistance, while the fundamentals of the problem were not addressed. He commented that even with additional market access opportunities, there remained for LDCs the basic issue of capacity constraints.","WTCOMTDM14.pdf","Zambia, Chairman, CTD, IMF, World, Bank"

The representative of Switzerland expressed concern about the number of issues proposed for inclusion on the Agenda of the Meeting and urged the CTD to choose between words and action. The Meeting should be devoted the core issue identified in the Singapore Ministerial Declaration, which was “to foster an integrated approach to assisting these countries and enhancing their trading opportunities"". The focus should be on trade assistance to the LDCs, although other general items could be added. He supported the need for the CTD to have regular progress reports and said that Switzerland wished to actively participate in informal consultations. As regards the international organizations to be involved in the preparation, he recalled that the Ministerial Declaration had clearly stated that UNCTAD, ITC and WTO should prepare the Meeting.","WTCOMTDM14.pdf","Switzerland, CTD, Singapore, CTD, Switzerland, UNCTAD, ITC, WTO"

The representative of Korea reminded the Committee that funding was one of the most important elements to be taken into account when organizing a meeting and asked the Secretariat for an estimate, its proposals for funding, and whether the costs would be shared by the ITC and the UNCTAD. The Chairman acknowledged the importance of this point.","WTCOMTDM14.pdf","Korea, Committee, Secretariat, ITC, UNCTAD, Chairman"

He expected that the cooperation which had already begun would continue and that common documentation from the organizations concerned would be prepared. Regarding the Agenda, he supported the point made by the delegation of Switzerland that it should not be too comprehensive in order to advance due WT/COMTD/M/14 Page 4 preparation and ensure a successful outcome. He agreed on the importance of involving the private sector, but felt that Member governments should first consolidate the objectives. He asked for clarification of the reference in the Note to ""selected investors"".

The representative of Uganda appreciated the Chairman's efforts in steering the CTD successfully to adopt an integrated programme of action for the LDCs, and hoped that concrete activities would result. He thanked the three secretariats for moving expeditiously to prepare for the Meeting. His delegation felt that the Agenda should cover the problems that faced the integration of LDCs, and supported the point made by the delegation of Zambia about the need for greater policy coherence. He urged the involvement of the financial institutions and UNDP in preparing the Meeting, and stressed the need for the active participation of LDCs in identifying the problems to be addressed. He agreed with the importance of involving the private sector, especially in LDCs, in order to assess the difficulties they faced and how they could be supported. He welcomed Geneva as the venue for the Meeting. He recalled also the need to avoid overlap with the UN meeting on land-locked countries, urged expediency so that momentum be maintained, and asked to be kept regularly informed of the preparatory process.","WTCOMTDM14.pdf","Uganda, Chairman, CTD, Zambia, UNDP, Geneva, UN"
"901",901,"15","15.       The representative of the United States thanked the Chairman for his leadership in the CTD and in proposing the High Level Meeting. Regarding the Informal Note, he agreed the phases suggested were within the framework of the Agenda. Tangible results would entail much work and tough decision- making prior to the Meeting itself, and he made two general points. First, he recommended no change to the organizations that had been identified as co-organizers; although many other international organizations might make useful input to the process, this should be channelled through the co-organizers for the sake of efficiency. Secondly, he supported the involvement of the private sector and encouraged arrangements to be made for their participation, through a parallel process, early in the process. He felt that the Meeting should not be held until concrete results were available. Rhetoric should be avoided.","WTCOMTDM14.pdf","United, States, Chairman, CTD"
"902",902,"16","16.      The representative of Canada said the Meeting should not be considered a pledging session. The objective was to launch integrated, country-specific, cooperation programmes. He agreed that information technology was critical for LDCs' trading opportunities, and supported the view that it should be incorporated into the issue of technical assistance and not treated separately. He noted that a Conference, ""Global Knowledge 97”, would take place from 22-25 June in Canada to consider the contribution of information technology to development, and he suggested that a report from that Conference be used in the High Level Meeting to focus on the trade-related aspects of information technology and how they relate to LDCs. The date of 26-27 June for the Meeting was acceptable as long as proper preparations could be completed in time to produce meaningful results. He was somewhat concerned that broadening the co-organization of the Meeting would make it more difficult logistically, but he was open to inviting the IMF, World Bank and UNDP to express their interest in this regard. Finally, he supported others in thanking the Chairman for his leadership in the CTD.","WTCOMTDM14.pdf","Canada, Canada, IMF, World, Bank, UNDP, Chairman, CTD"

He shared the view that information technology be included in the Agenda. He was convinced that the Committee had the necessary guidelines to focus on the problems of the LDCs and their solutions through the Plan of Action adopted in Singapore. He felt the continuation of informal consultations would be the best method of preparing for the Meeting.","WTCOMTDM14.pdf","Hungary, Chairman, Committee, LDCs, Singapore"

The representative of Hong Kong said the Informal Note would be useful in focusing on the preparation of the Meeting, which should be an action-oriented with clear objectives in mind. For the outcome to be sustainable for the LDCs, it would be essential to involve them in the identification of priorities. The Agenda seemed comprehensive. He felt the developed and more advanced developing                                                                           WT/COMTD/M/14                                                                           Page 5 countries could help facilitate the LDCs' trade and investment opportunities, and he recalled lengthy discussions regarding this prior to the Singapore Ministerial. He supported the participation of the private sector, and felt its role should be precisely defined. He agreed with the suggested timing of the various phases of the preparatory process, and with the suggested duration of the Meeting. Hong Kong was committed to making a positive contribution to the Meeting, and he thanked the Chairman for his commitment to the work of the CTD.","WTCOMTDM14.pdf","Hong, Kong, Singapore, Hong, Kong, Chairman, CTD"
"905",905,"19","19.      The Chairman said it was clear that everybody expected a practical outcome to result from the High Level Meeting. The Plan of Action would form the framework. He stressed the immediate need for the Secretariat to contact the IMF, World Bank and UNDP to clarify their intentions as regards their participation. In his view there was no need to include too many other organizers. Further work needed to be done on the basis of the CTD discussion, and he trusted that the Secretariat had taken good note of all the comments made. Further informal consultations and meetings with delegations, led by the Chairpersons of the CTD and the Sub-Committee on Least developed Countries would allow Members to keep track of progress and provide input.

The Chairman recalled that Ministers in Singapore agreed to organize a High-Level Meeting with the UNCTAD and ITC in 1997, along with aid agencies, multilateral financial institutions and least-developed countries (LDCs), to foster an integrated approach to assist these countries to enhance their trading opportunities. The initiative for the Meeting had come from the CTD. He had been conducting informal consultations with a number of delegations and the three secretariats involved, and the secretariats had circulated an informal Note on the preparation of the meeting in the CTD as a basis for discussion. He encouraged delegations to comment on the substance of the Note, noting that the WTO Secretariat would have to act quickly in organizing the Meeting and needed guidance from the CTD. Two questions deserved immediate attention: what should be the Agenda of the meeting, and which international organizations should be involved? Regarding procedure, he requested the agreement of the CTD in principle on the four steps suggested for the preparatory process under Item C.3 of the Note.","WTCOMTDM14.pdf","Chairman, Singapore, UNCTAD, ITC, CTD, CTD, WTO, Secretariat, CTD, CTD"

He noted also that representatives from the ITC and the UNCTAD had been invited to the meeting to present the CTD with their views on activities.","WTCOMTDM14.pdf","Chairman, Committee, Secretariat, WTO, ITC, UNCTAD, CTD"
"909",909,"22","22.      The Secretariat said the revised non-paper incorporated comments made by delegates at the last CTD meeting and a submission received from the delegation of New Zealand. It followed the guidelines for technical cooperation in Part 2 of the Operational Directives and included five sections: Modes of Delivery, Long-Term Engagement, Coordination with Other International Organizations, Management, and Monitoring Follow-Up and Evaluation. Three broad objectives were identified. First, to provide broad and systematic coverage of WTO issues, while allowing flexibility for the Secretariat in the application of its programmes. As requested, an Annex had been added to provide for indicative descriptions of the modes of delivery used in the Secretariat's activities. The section on Coordination with International Institutions had been revised to be more precise. The role of the Technical Cooperation and Training Division had been clarified in the section on Management, and included suggestions by Members regarding its procedures for the presentation of their requests. The second objective concerned procedures for the Preparation of Programmes, and the third related to provisions of Voluntary Contributions by Donors. The last section on Monitoring Follow-Up and Evaluation had been expanded to include an external evaluation of technical cooperation activities every three years.","WTCOMTDM14.pdf","Secretariat, New, Zealand, WTO, Secretariat, Secretariat, Technical, Cooperation, and, Training, Division, Members, Preparation, of, Programmes"
"910",910,"23","23.       The representative of UNCTAD Secretariat welcomed collaboration between the WTO, ITC, and the UNCTAD on technical cooperation issues. UNCTAD IX had broken new ground on these matters, and had given a mandate to strengthen and expand work on technical cooperation and to integrate it into the general work programme of UNCTAD. This would enhance common objectives of UNCTAD and the WTO. UNCTAD strived to respond to the requests, concerns and priorities of member States WT/COMTD/M/14 Page 6 while taking into account the ""supply-driven"" aspects of financing and the secretariat's capability to meet a division of labour so as to maximize its comparative advantage. He quoted the following passages from UNCTAD's mandate:         “Enhancing national capacities, in terms of human resources and administrative infrastructures         to enable WTO Members to adjust effectively to meet their obligations and to take advantage         of their rights, including by helping them to enhance their understanding of WTO rights and         obligations, as well as improving the transparency of their trade reviews""         ""Assisting developing countries in collaboration with WIPO and WTO to identify opportunities         provided by the TRIPS Agreement, including for attracting investment and new technologies         and contributing, as appropriate to the work of relevant international organizations in the         implementation of the Uruguay Round Final Act Decision on Measures in Favour of the Least-         Developed Countries, by assisting the LDCs, ...

Assistance was directed towards helping countries strengthen their services sector, develop their competition policies, legislation and institution building, and integrate their overall trade, environment and development goals. The WTO and UNCTAD were already working together to integrate countries into the trading system in an efficient way. He cited the success of the Joint Programme for Africa. Thus far, assessment missions had been sent to eight African countries, including four LDCs, which focused on human resources development and institutional capacity building with regard to the Uruguay Round Agreements. The next stage would focus on supportive measures required to strengthen the export capacity of beneficiary countries.","WTCOMTDM14.pdf","WTO, UNCTAD, Joint, Programme, Africa, Uruguay"
"912",912,"25","25.       UNCTAD's Technical Cooperation Programme covered all areas of the work of its Secretariat, including trade in goods and services, investment, technology and enterprise development, trade efficiency and services, infrastructure and transport, finance and debt management. Annual delivery amounted to about US$20-25 million a year, out of total budgets of about US$50 million a year. At any given time, about 300 projects were under implementation, with about one-third directed at LDCs and 40 per cent for Africa. Operations responded to requests from individual beneficiary countries, developing or in transition, and at regional and inter-regional levels. Activities included policy advice on select issues within UNCTAD's competence, such as analytical work, public sector decision-making, and information from data bases. He added that training and human-resource development had been major elements of UNCTAD's activities; these were crucial to the development of capacity building. This ranged from ad hoc activities, seminars and workshops, to more structured activities such as the development and strengthening of local training capacities through UNCTAD's work with ""train for trade"", which included a training programme for maritime transport. Emphasis had been on a more structured and deliberate long-term process of developing training capacity. As for funding, UNDP continued to be the single most important source of support for UNCTAD's technical cooperation activities despite a significant decrease in its share for the total Programme. In addition, a variety of trust funds had been established for the purpose of implementing these projects. These were financed from a wide range of bilateral donors, of which the European Commission's DG8, which handles the European Development Fund, and DG1, responsible for developing countries and those in transition, were mentioned along with support from foundations and trust funds held by international financial institutions, including the World Bank. Developing countries also contributed to the Programme as a whole, or for activities in their own countries through resources available or from proceeds of loans, particularly from the World Bank and the International Development Association. Cooperation took place with numerous agencies including the World Bank on trade and financial issues, the IMF with its Customs Reform Programme and ASECUDA, which was its single largest programme, with UNDP and UNIDO, among other UN organizations, and a variety of regional and sub-regional organizations                                                                               WT/COMTD/M/14                                                                               Page 7 through joint activities or sharing information.

He added that UNCTAD was guided by the UN General Assembly overall, particularly by the system-wide decisions the Assembly took on operational activities for development which have been the basis for collaboration with governments through the national execution modality. This was an increasing feature of the way technical cooperation was carried out by UN organizations. Projects were monitored regularly by both beneficiaries and the Secretariat and were subject to independent evaluation and review by member States, the Trade and Development Board and its subsidiary machinery. Procedures ranged from the use of a project document format to the use of UNDP resident representatives, who acted on UNCTAD's behalf on issues pertaining to technical cooperation. As a UN organization, UNCTAD was bound by the financial rules and regulations governing the administration of trust funds and UNDP financed projects. Adoption of a strategy for technical cooperation work as part of a rolling three-year plan was scheduled for discussion at the Executive Session of the Trade and Development Board in March. UNCTAD IX clearly indicated the priority assigned to LDCs, which should receive increased attention of about one third in the future. To that end, the Secretariat had established a trust fund, which included contributions from developing countries, especially directed towards LDCs to encourage them to launch comprehensive programmes of trade and investment. The Integrated Programme for Africa would be part of this arrangement.","WTCOMTDM14.pdf","UNCTAD, UN, General, Assembly, Assembly, UN, Secretariat, Trade, and, Development, Board, UNDP, UNCTAD, UN, UNCTAD, UNDP, Trade, and, Development, Board, UNCTAD, Secretariat, Integrated, Programme, Africa"
"914",914,"27","27.      The representative of the ITC said technical cooperation was an essential part of ITC's activities. He cited its mandate to support developing and transition economies, and especially their business sectors, to realize their full potential for developing exports and improving import operations, with LDCs a priority in its work. ITC's first objective was the development of national capacities for improving trade performance of businesses in the context of building national business service institutions to help them expand and carry out their activity. It had comparative advantages in six core services: product and market development, trade support services, trade information, trade-related human resources development, international purchasing and supply management and needs assessment and programme design in the trade field. Although its main focus had been the international competitiveness of businesses, trade promotion strategy remained crucial as the ITC was concerned with the nexus between the public and private sectors. He noted that all of its technical cooperation activities were at the national level, and cited two examples. At one extreme, it had tailor-made, multi-year, and multi-faceted projects, combining information training, trade training and product upgrading components. In a typical case, an ITC Project Coordinator in the country would be the focal point for implementation; thereby, the country was at the centre of gravity for implementation. At the other extreme, projects would be headquarters-based, inter-regional or global, such as the Uruguay Round Follow-Up Programme, financed by the Global Trust Fund. Here, the business implications of the Uruguay Round Agreements, and trainer training events were offered to partner countries. Presentations were adapted and directed toward national circumstances through the events organized from Geneva with national contacts. Sixty- eight such events were held last year, and benefitted from input by the WTO Secretariat and others, including FAO and ISO.","WTCOMTDM14.pdf","ITC, ITC, ITC, ITC, ITC, Uruguay, Global, Trust, Fund, Uruguay, Geneva, WTO, Secretariat, FAO, ISO"

In all cases, the project started with an idea based on country-specific or collective needs assessment. If it required a major undertaking or new approaches, it would be first reviewed in an inter-divisional forum within the ITC that brought together functional, product and marketing, and geographic expertise and clarified the respective roles of its staff in the project development process. Donors would then be contacted and the development of the project taken to its final stages. In a country-specific context, a donor might finance pre-project design work, although it was not unusual for projects, whether national, sub-regional, or inter-regional, to be designed to a large extent before financing was secured. The project in its final form would be subject to an inter-divisional review where substantive issues would be sorted out. At this stage WT/COMTD/M/14 Page 8 the focus would be on implementation arrangements, including sources of expertise, internal and external, to complete the task according to the indicated schedule. Project monitoring responsibilities and evaluation arrangements were specified in the project document, usually based on a UNDP format. At any given time, the ITC was implementing over 100 projects, most of which were national or sub-regional projects.","WTCOMTDM14.pdf","WTO, UNCTAD, ITC, Integrated, Programme, Africa, ITC, UNDP, ITC"

The representative of the United States appreciated learning more about the specific aspects of coordination and noted the potential for overlap, which he said was of common concern in the CTD.

The representative of Madagascar said that the Meeting should testify to the complementary activities of different international organizations in giving integrated assistance to LDCs. He hoped it would be an opportunity to launch immediate, integrated and coherent activities. He approved the current focus of the Note on technical issues, but noted there were other measures which could help prevent the trade and development of LDCs from being marginalized and in that regard welcomed the inclusion of improved market access for LDCs as an objective of the Meeting. Regarding the Agenda, his delegation stressed the need to consider initiatives that could be applied and implemented immediately. He welcomed the inclusion of a study on the use of information technologies for LDCs, as their potential needed to be better understood, and he felt that synergies could be developed in this area with UNCTAD. As regards other aspects of coordination, he reminded the CTD that UNCTAD would organize a pilot seminar on partnership with the private sector in order to mobilize investment for LDCs, and he hoped this would be integrated into the Meeting to further enhance synergies. He asked that the list of international agencies involved in the Meeting not be closed until after further consultations. He supported the participation of the private sector, and suggested inviting industrialists and exporters from LDCs. The proposed date and duration of the Meeting was acceptable to his delegation. Regarding the preparatory process, he urged the close involvement of LDCs to allow them to define their needs; they should be assisted in this regard by the three secretariats.

He also referred to the long-term engagement noted in paragraph 2C, and asked whether it was limited only to trainers and expertise developed under WTO technical cooperation activities or whether there were possibilities for a national government to nominate experts to participate in programmes undertaken jointly in its territory? He asked for clarification of the term ""information technology-based training material"" referred to in paragraph 6, and said it might be clearer to use the phrase ""electronic-based training material"" to avoid confusion for recipients of the Assistance Programme. His delegation strongly endorsed the statement by Singapore to allow for flexibility in the assessment of programmes that might be duplicated or overlapped, and felt that in the context of the demand-driven nature of such programmes more flexibility should be allowed.","WTCOMTDM14.pdf","India, UNCTAD, WTO, Secretariat, WTO, Assistance, Programme, Singapore"

It provided a good basis to strengthen relevant technical cooperation activities and make the approved guidelines more operational. Citing paragraph 3A, he asked whether the CTD would like to include UNDP among organizations explicitly mentioned as he saw value in such a consultation. Citing paragraph 4C, regarding an indicative three-year plan comparable to the rolling plan already established under UNCTAD, he requested coordination between the two organizations on this question. He was concerned with sub- paragraph 4D regarding the definition of the needs for contributions, in terms of human resources and financial means. He said it suggested an annual programme based on specific requests from recipient countries, and asked the Secretariat to clarify the amount of contributions needed in order to attain a balance between the needs requested and the contributions available. He asked whether it was possible to make available human resources from donor countries as well? Citing paragraph 4F, on the Provision of Voluntary Contributions, he recalled the suggestion for a time-limit for the announcement of voluntary contributions and wondered if it was possible to consider another deadline; his delegation would favour an earlier deadline.","WTCOMTDM14.pdf","Norway, Secretariat, Members, CTD, UNDP, Secretariat"

The representative of New Zealand said his delegation supported the views expressed by other delegations regarding the need for complementarity between the activities of the three organizations, and agreed with Singapore that competition would be healthy. He said the Secretariat's non-paper was quite comprehensive and provided practical guidance. He was particularly pleased with paragraph 5C that incorporated his delegation's suggestions regarding an external evaluation. He explained that the process would involve hiring an independent consultant from an international organization or privately that would undertake an overall management audit of the programmes, not only to provide for efficiency but also to conduct a qualitative evaluation of their impact. This should evaluate both the effectiveness of WTO technical cooperation and ensure that feedback mechanisms were working so lessons learned would be registered into the programme's preparation and delivery. He supported the conduct of an annual internal review in addition to a three-year review, reasoning that it would bring WTO procedures in line with international practice and maximize improvements in the programme's operation by drawing on lessons from past experience. As regards training, he felt that four weeks seemed to be enough time for most courses of a substantive nature and reasonable time for WTO officials to be absent; he accepted the range of 2-6 weeks cited in the non-paper, although he felt the nature of the training would be a consideration. Citing the example of the two-week trade policy course proposed for Pacific WT/COMTD/M/14 Page 10 Island countries, he felt the period adequate for its purposes. He congratulated the Netherlands for its generous contribution to the Fund, and encouraged others to do likewise.","WTCOMTDM14.pdf","New, Zealand, Singapore, Secretariat, WTO, WTO, WTO, Netherlands"

The representative of Bangladesh hoped the High Level Meeting would lead to a more coherent and integrated international approach for supporting trade-related activities of the LDCs, at all levels, and appreciated the leadership of the Chair. There needed to be a close cooperation among the three secretariats in order to find solutions to problems. He was pleased the World Bank, IMF, and other international and regional financial institutions would be invited. The support of key developed and developing countries was needed for the Meeting to be successful. The Secretariat Note included views already expressed in the CTD, and he urged further CTD input. The scope for assisting LDCs went beyond aid and technical assistance, and should involve market access and export diversification, as well as investment opportunities and the immediate launching of country-specific cooperation programmes. Most problems facing LDCs were structural, and these constraints needed to be removed to allow for progress. Regarding Africa, he said the burden of debt remained a deterrent to development. There was also need for international cooperation in the commodity field, although this and other issues might amount to too much to address at one Meeting. It would be necessary to be selective, but other issues should not be disregarded. He noted that Bangladesh had had a measure of success with donors in achieving common goals, and he appealed to the key global economic actors, both public and private, to send high level delegations to the Meeting. All LDCs should be encouraged to participate, and they would need to be assisted financially and with preparatory expertise. Ministers in Singapore had envisaged the Meeting could take place in the first half of 1997, and the Secretariat needed to begin preparations immediately.","WTCOMTDM14.pdf","Bangladesh, World, Bank, IMF, Secretariat, CTD, Africa, Bangladesh, Singapore, Secretariat"

The representative of Turkey asked for elaboration of the criteria for assistance to the countries and regions concerned, and stressed that complementarity and competition could go well together, for both bilateral and regional technical assistance; while bilateral technical assistance could be very beneficial, more time and money could be saved when complemented by regional schemes. He cited Turkey's own participation in the Black Sea Economic Cooperation and the Economic Cooperation Organization, which were comprised of new and prospective WTO Members. Turkey was assisting these states to become more familiar with the workings of the WTO and was in contact with ITC and the WTO to support these regional schemes.","WTCOMTDM14.pdf","Turkey, Turkey, Black, Sea, Economic, Cooperation, Economic, Cooperation, Organization, WTO, Members, Turkey, WTO, ITC, WTO"

The representative of Bangladesh appreciated that the presentations accorded due priorities to the needs of LDCs, which was of key interest to his country, and in particular the requirements of Africa. His country had received considerable technical assistance in the past and had been able to effectively use it in enhancing its capabilities. He endorsed the caveat raised by Singapore, among others, against taking an excessive view on coordination which would eliminate the distinctive features of the three respective institutions.","WTCOMTDM14.pdf","Bangladesh, Africa, Singapore"
"931",931,"42","42.      The representative of Argentina appreciated the work being done on technical cooperation. While supporting the point made by Singapore, he cautioned against overt competition between the three organizations and added that they should render services according to needs, The Secretariat's non-paper raised the issue of flexibility, which he felt should be maintained as regards the modalities of rendering technical cooperation. He shared the view of the UNCTAD representative in that new areas of interests to the WTO, such as competition policies, should be integrated into a cooperative programme which would draw upon work already done by the UNCTAD. He cited trade facilitation as an area in which UNCTAD had expertise, and requested further information on other areas in which the respective organizations planned to cooperate.","WTCOMTDM14.pdf","Argentina, Singapore, The, Secretariat, UNCTAD, WTO, UNCTAD, UNCTAD"
"932",932,"43","43.      The representative of Korea generally agreed with the Informal Note. He had intended a question regarding the commissioning process for an external evaluation, but had since heard the reply from the representative of New Zealand. Regarding Point 4C in the Management section, he asked about the rationale for having a three-year plan, considering that Ministerial Meetings were held every two years; perhaps it would better to coincide with them. With respect to Point 2 of the Annex, he felt that five-day seminars and workshops were too lengthy and advised against making such an exact reference in this document.","WTCOMTDM14.pdf","Korea, New, Zealand"
"933",933,"44","44.      The representative of Uganda appreciated the presentations made. He emphasized the need to reach the private sector in developing countries, and felt that these types of programmes would succeed only when the private sector was able to take advantage of the international trading environment. He welcomed the efforts of ITC to this effect, and asked for clarification about the business guide being formulated for the private sector, particularly on how the feedback on its impact had been arrived at as well as its implications. He shared the views of Singapore that coordination should avoid overlap while maintaining each organisations areas of specialization. He noted that the UNCTAD and WTO programmes were more focused on public institutions, whereas ITC could complement them in reaching the private sector. Coordination should not be used to curtail important activities, but rather to enhance programmes that were effective. He asked the representative of the UNCTAD to explain his statement about the ""educative process"" of LDCs. He noted agreement with the direction of the Secretariat's non-paper.","WTCOMTDM14.pdf","Uganda, ITC, Singapore, UNCTAD, WTO, ITC, UNCTAD, Secretariat"

"935",935,"46","46.     The representative of Senegal recalled that the call for coordination between the three institutions was recent. She agreed with the Long-Term Engagement noted in paragraph 2 of the Secretariat's non-paper, particularly that the training of trainers allowed for better dissemination of information at a lower cost; she added that her country was among those interested in this item. In regards to external evaluation, she hoped that the beneficiary countries would be involved in the selection of their examiners. Citing paragraph 1 on the Modes of Delivery, she hoped that within the seminars more importance would be given to the specific benefits of the participation of LDCs in the multilateral trading system.","WTCOMTDM14.pdf","Senegal, Secretariat"

He invited Members to give their views on how cooperation should be achieved. He assured Switzerland that the question raised by Morocco at the Committee on Budget, Finance and Administration would be addressed also in the CTD.","WTCOMTDM14.pdf","Chairman, WTO, Members, Switzerland, Morocco, Committee, on, Budget, ,, Finance, and, Administration, CTD"
"938",938,"49","49.      The representative of UNCTAD replied to comments on the issue of complementarity and duplication. The point made by Singapore and others to allow for healthy competition was well taken. It was a difficult issue to place in a neat framework, due to the dynamics involved between a potential beneficiary requesting help, an organization that was able to respond and a donor. Clearly, duplication in a wasteful sense should be avoided. He agreed with Argentina on the need to avoid overlap while allowing for joint approaches to the same issue. He cited the initiative of the Government of Switzerland, which convened a workshop at the end of 1995 in Ascona, to discuss this issue with international organizations concerned with trade-related technical cooperation. The meeting did not succeed in clarifying the role of each institution, but it did promote an effort to establish a mechanism for information exchange and to avoid duplication. In addition, the ITC had taken the initiative, together with UNCTAD and the WTO, to produce a succinct and clear statement regarding the main elements that differentiated the technical cooperation work of each organization. In that light, the Integrated Programme for Africa and others should provide opportunities for further learning and lead to maximization of complementarity and minimization of overlap. He added that this process should also involve the World Bank, the IMF and UNDP. The comparative advantage of the WTO Secretariat with regard to the outcome of the Uruguay Round, particularly in explaining contractual obligations, was obvious. UNCTAD would help countries take advantage of trade and other opportunities that emerged from these negotiations. For instance, UNCTAD's Commission on Investment had called for the convening of an extra meeting to discuss the possible impact of multilateral investment regimes with a view towards regional, sub-regional and bilateral arrangements; this would contribute to an area generally handled by the WTO. In a wider sense, trade-related technical cooperation was included in the mandate, and covered investment-related, technology-related, finance-related matters as they pertained to the supply response. In addition to increasing exports and trade efficiency, capacity development would include infrastructure and human resources; these were areas in which UNCTAD would play a role. The negotiation process was another area where UNCTAD could assist countries through programmes supporting commercial diplomacy. Officials from LDCs could then better understand the issues that would arise from a built-in agenda and other forms of negotiations. Accession procedures would remain the domain of the WTO. UNCTAD could complement this process by assisting Members with the substantive issues that might arise, while ITC had enormous expertise in the field of export promotion and in dealing with specific sectors and with enterprises.

The representative of Bolivia said the initiative for the High-Level Meeting reflected the spirit of the WTO Agreement to fully integrate all Members into the multilateral trading system and contribute to the expansion of trade.

He said the results of the Meeting should be integrated and applied to other countries with small economies, including land-locked countries.","WTCOMTDM14.pdf","Bolivia, WTO, Members, LDCs"
"940",940,"50","50.      At the Ascona meeting, the focus was on the national level as the coordination of technical cooperation programmes and other forms of development cooperation was evidently the responsibility of the host country. He cited the case of a country in the process of accession to WTO that had invited the three organizations and others, such as UNDP and the World Bank, to conduct an exercise regarding the coordination of trade-related technical cooperation; this had proven to be a promising initiative. He stressed the importance of emphasizing the demand-driven nature of technical assistance, as the beneficiary country was in the main position to determine its needs in light of its own capacities and resources. UNCTAD had a good working relationship with the WTO and ITC, and it found the exchange of information particularly helpful. He personally had not encountered a clear case of duplication or lack of prior consultation, but even so the full potential for cooperation among the organizations had yet to be realized. From UNCTAD's standpoint, the preparatory process for the proposed High-Level Meeting on LDCs would be useful in carrying forward efforts to enhance and deepen existing cooperation. Regarding the evaluation of the Integrated Programme for Africa, he noted that a request for such a review had been made in the Trade and Development Board last October, whereby the three organizations agreed to proceed when the results were sufficient to justify such an exercise. It was UNCTAD's view that such a stage had not yet been reached. In response to the question of criteria from Morocco, he said UNCTAD's Programme had no a priori criteria but its projects were based on the nature of requests and availability of funding. From there, the secretariat evaluated requests to determine questions of competence and capacity. Some popular programmes such as the Customs Reform Programme and the Debt Management Programme had resulted in heavy demand beyond current capacity. The next stage of consideration would lead to the design of projects based on generally accepted guidelines to ensure they would be responsive to the needs of beneficiary countries and the secretariat's capacity.","WTCOMTDM14.pdf","Ascona, WTO, UNDP, World, Bank, UNCTAD, WTO, ITC, UNCTAD, Integrated, Programme, Africa, Trade, and, Development, Board, UNCTAD, Morocco, UNCTAD, Customs, Reform, Programme, Debt, Management, Programme"
"941",941,"51","51.      Regarding financial participation by developing countries, such activity took two forms. First, there have been contributions to general activities of interest to these countries, including work on the General System of Preferences, to the Trust Fund on Investment and Transnational Corporations, and on Competition Policies and Restrictive Business Practices, etc. The Trust Fund established recently in UNCTAD had benefited from contributions from developing countries, including India. Secondly, proceeds used by developing countries from World Bank loans, or those from the Inter-American Development Bank, Asian Development Bank and the African Development Bank, had led to financing of technical cooperation. Programmes financed in this manner include the ASECUDA, the Customs Reform Programme, and the Debt Management Programme. Regarding the rolling three-year plan, he said that UNCTAD had found the period too lengthy as the beneficiaries understandably found it difficult to indicate what their particular requirements would be that far ahead. Likewise, donors were not always in a position to indicate the supply side. Consequently, the focus has been on a one-year exercise, while allowing for some indications of what the main areas of work would be in the second and third years. He agreed with the point made by Turkey about the collaboration between bilateral initiatives and regional initiatives, an area in which the secretariat had much experience and was in fact having discussions at the moment with the European Cooperation Organization. On the question raised by Peru, Argentina, and Uganda, about work by the UNCTAD in connection with competition policies, he saw this as a matter of information exchange and noted the secretariat was in discussion with potential donors to mobilize resources for seminars and workshops. He understood it was in contact with the WTO on this matter, which had led to cooperation and, hopefully, its participation in these meetings. Regarding trade efficiency, it was his understanding that the CTD would be undertaking exploratory work in this area. It had already requested UNCTAD to provide the General Council with information regarding UNCTAD's activities towards trade facilitation under its Trade Efficiency Programme.","WTCOMTDM14.pdf","General, System, of, Preferences, Restrictive, Business, Practices, Trust, Fund, UNCTAD, India, World, Bank, Inter-American, Development, Bank, Asian, Development, Bank, African, Development, Bank, Customs, Reform, Programme, Debt, Management, Programme, UNCTAD, Turkey, European, Cooperation, Organization, Peru, Argentina, Uganda, UNCTAD, WTO, CTD, UNCTAD, General, Council, UNCTAD"

Regarding the management of technical cooperation, this involved close fusion between regular work financed from the programme budget and the operational activities that were financed from extra- budgetary resources, which drew upon analytical work and contributed to intergovernmental deliberations.

Logistical and administrative support was provided by the Administrative Service of its Secretariat. As regards the allocation of administrative costs, he said that each project undertaken earned support costs of 13 per cent of the delivery of the amount actually carried out. Those resources were allocated to support functions, either to the Administrative Service centrally or toward the divisions.","WTCOMTDM14.pdf","UNCTAD, Administrative, Service, Secretariat, Administrative, Service"

The Chairman stressed that a careful evaluation of the managerial structure of the UNCTAD and the WTO might be in order to assure that focus was maintained towards the activity.

"944",944,"54","54.      The representative of ITC agreed with UNCTAD in that it was too early for a comprehensive evaluation of the Integrated Programme for Africa. He explained that currently, the needs analysis reports prepared by countries received feedback from the three organizations, and were then returned to the governments for consideration before the finalization of the project proposals and funding. Thus far, only one country had reached that stage but others were close, which should result in a broad implementation phase over the coming months. As regards the three-year rolling medium-term plan, he said the ITC had launched its own plan and this was a valuable planning tool. The first year laid out a comprehensive annual operational plan while the next two evaluated output. He noted that seminars had requested more product-specific approaches, such as addressing the business implications of the Uruguay Round Agreements. ITC would focus on such areas more this year. In addition, it had conducted an internal management review last summer which led to helpful recommendations now being pursued, and an evaluation would take place later in the year.","WTCOMTDM14.pdf","ITC, UNCTAD, Integrated, Programme, Africa, ITC, Uruguay, ITC"
"945",945,"55","55.     The representative of the WTO Secretariat noted the different views of Members regarding cooperation, and said the WTO was moving in this direction. He recalled three major developments within the last eighteen months. First, periodic meetings had been initiated among the heads of the three organisations and provided a formal structure to advance coordination. Second, the Integrated Programme for Africa. Third, the secretariats had worked on certain preparations for UNCTAD IX. Regarding Morocco's question on internal management, most WTO divisions were involved with technical cooperation due to their expertise in certain areas. The Technical Cooperation and Training Division nevertheless was the primary provider of technical assistance, and it liaised with other divisions. The Management Committee along with the Deputies and the Director-General allocated resources by formula, emphasis, or major decisions of a policy nature. With regard to Peru’s request, he said the working parties on investment and competition policy had not yet been established. However, the Secretariat would provide technical assistance from the responsible divisions wherever appropriate. Discussion had taken place on the possible extension of the Integrated Programme for Africa to more LDCs. Since it was a major endeavour, the three organizations wanted to proceed in a thorough manner. No activities were implemented without the consent of the three secretariats. He acknowledged the concerns of Venezuela, and said that the integrity of services to all other developing and transition economies would be taken seriously.","WTCOMTDM14.pdf","WTO, Secretariat, Members, WTO, Integrated, Programme, Africa, UNCTAD, Morocco, WTO, Technical, Cooperation, and, Training, Division, Management, Committee, Director-General, Peru, Secretariat, Integrated, Programme, Africa, Venezuela"

As for long-term engagement and the provision for trainers, he noted that in the guidelines for technical cooperation, developing countries would provide trainers when they had the human resources necessary, as supported by the Training for Trainers Programme. In regards to the training material, the Secretariat remained open to any suggestions. In the case of the Integrated Programme for Africa, a task force had been established to review the WT/COMTD/M/14 Page 14 training material being used. In reply to Switzerland’s concerns about coordination, he said that the Technical Cooperation and Training Division was the focal point for coordination among other bodies.","WTCOMTDM14.pdf","India, New, Zealand, Secretariat, Training, for, Trainers, Programme, Secretariat, Integrated, Programme, Africa, Switzerland, Technical, Cooperation, and, Training, Division"

The Chairman welcomed the enriching discussion and stressed that technical cooperation was demand-driven; it was therefore necessary for all Members to understand it and the services provided. He recalled his suggestion at the last CTD meeting that a manual be prepared by the secretariats of the three institutions that would explain the technical cooperation offered by each institution and how to receive it. He reminded the Members about the questionnaire sent out regarding technical cooperation, and cited a second letter urging them to respond. He requested the Secretariat to prepare a manual.","WTCOMTDM14.pdf","Chairman, Members, Members, Secretariat"

The two main objectives for the assessment of technical cooperation were derived from the guidelines. First, was to assist in the full integration of beneficiaries into the multilateral trading system and contribute to their trade expansion. Secondly, was to strengthen and enhance institutional and human capacities in the public sector; after consultation with governments, capacity building activities might include the private sector. These objectives were based on WTO activities including the meetings of the CTD, information gathered through seminars and workshops, and fact-finding missions. Missions for the Integrated Programme for Africa helped to determine focal points, although there was some difficulty because the information was not sufficient to draw comprehensive conclusions. Section 3 of the document included replies and comments based on the questionnaire. Also included were summaries of information gathered from the Integrated Programme for Africa and through fact-finding mission that we carried out in Asia and the Asia-Pacific islands. There were comments on the difficulties encountered in implementing obligations of the TRIPS Agreement. The document noted areas where cooperation had been carried out with other international organizations and in defining and applying those programmes. Since the information was incomplete, general conclusions on technical assistance would be difficult to draw at this time.","WTCOMTDM14.pdf","Secretariat, WTO, CTD, Integrated, Programme, Africa, Integrated, Programme, Africa, Asia, Asia-Pacific"

He was aware of the limitations posed by his delegation's current observer status, but Nepal took its participation in the WTO process with utmost seriousness. The Singapore meeting had been significant in two respects. First, it had helped with Nepal's process of accession; the Government was in the process of updating the Memorandum on the Foreign Trade Regime in accordance with WTO provisions, and it was about to establish a WTO division. Secondly, the comprehensive and integrated WTO Plan for Action for LDCs was a significant development. His delegation would be participating in preparations for the High Level Meeting in the context of Nepal's processes of economic liberalization and trade diversification, which would allow it to more fully integrate into and benefit from the increasingly globalized economy. He believed the integrated approach taken in defining the objectives of the Meeting was correct. Short, medium and long-term objectives should be defined, relating to enabling LDCs to participate more fully in the WTO institutionally, to improved market access for products of importance to LDCs, and to improving their supply capacity through resource transfers and technical assistance. He welcomed the proposal for involving an inner circle of international institutions, and said the LDCs themselves should provide the major inputs on priorities. He appreciated the Chairman's consultations in that regard, and hoped further mechanisms for such inputs would be defined. All interested LDCs should participate in the Meeting. In deciding on its timing, account should be taken of other meetings scheduled to address LDC concerns, such as the Special Session of the UN General Assembly in June on land-locked countries.","WTCOMTDM14.pdf","Nepal, Chairman, Nepal, WTO, Singapore, Nepal, Foreign, Trade, Regime, WTO, WTO, WTO, LDCs, Nepal, WTO, Chairman, UN, General, Assembly"

His delegation was committed to working with the CTD to advance trading opportunities for LDCs, and it was pleased with the follow-up to the Singapore Conference. He felt the scope of the Agenda and other preparations for the Meeting would be best addressed through informal consultations. He supported the suggestion that the list of intergovernmental organizations invited to the meeting should not be closed too early. Regarding specific points in the preparatory process, the CTD would need to ensure that it was fully responsive to the specific needs of LDCs and he proposed that it meet in open-ended informal sessions as preparations for the Meeting advanced so as to provide guidance to the Secretariat and to keep track of progress.","WTCOMTDM14.pdf","India, Chairman, CTD, CTD, Secretariat"

He welcomed the suggestions of the representative of Switzerland regarding a focal point to enhance coordination of trade programs among all institutions.

She said that the proposed focal point might be difficult to establish, due to the diversity of technical cooperation within a country, ranging from TBT to agricultural programs, and other matters. She asked the Secretariat how it would handle requests for technical cooperation from Members; wether preferences would be given on a regional basis, in order of submission, or if some other methodology would be used.

He wondered whether provisions of technical cooperation by donor countries would be excluded as a result. The representative of the Secretariat responded that the Guidelines for Technical Cooperation stated that the Secretariat would respond to requests since it operated on a demand-driven basis.

The Chairman drew attention to the document entitled ""Update of Work Carried Out By the Committee on Trade and Development"". 1 Pursuant to the outcome of his informal consultations, he proposed that, for the first half of year, the focus of the Committee's work be on technical assistance activities, with a particular emphasis on implementation modalities. He suggested that it be the core item for discussion at the Committee's next meeting. For the second half of the year, he proposed that the Committee undertake a review of the participation of developing countries in world trade. He recalled that the Committee had looked at this issue last year, on the basis of Secretariat documentation covering the past twenty years. 2 He proposed that, this year, examination would focus on a shorter time period, covering the past 4-5 years, which included the 2 1/2 years since the WTO entered into force. The Secretariat could be requested to prepare background papers to provide the facts, while the Committee would analyse the data, drawing out themes which might, for example, point to certain policy conclusions, or to features of market access developments, or to aspects of a more systemic nature related to WTO Agreements. He continued by saying that, following consultations held with delegations, he felt that, while the Committee should keep under review the implementation of WTO provisions relating to the special and differential treatment of developing countries in the multilateral trading system, a another major review was best carried out in 1998. He recalled that the Committee had done a major review in 1996.  This year, he noted that several of the specialised WTO Committees would be examining the implementation of the special and differential treatment provisions of particular WTO Agreements: for example, on TBT, SPS, Textiles and Clothing and Rules of Origin. He said that the Committee would not lose sight of such an important matter. However, he was of view that it might be more constructive for the Committee to undertake another review of the issue in 1998 rather than this year, to allow more experience to be gained and to provide the Committee with a more medium-term picture of implementation across-the-board on which to base its discussions.","WTCOMTDM15.pdf","Committee, Work, Programme, Chairman, Committee, on, Trade, and, Development, Committee, Committee, Committee, Committee, Secretariat, WTO, Secretariat, Committee, WTO, Committee, WTO, Committee, WTO, Committees, TBT, SPS, Committee, Committee, Committee"

"987",987,"31","31.       The Chair of the Sub-Committee said that the Secretariat had booked the large UN General Assembly conference room at the Palais des Nations for 26-27 June. She recalled that, at its recent meeting on 28 February, the Sub-Committee had agreed that the views of the least-developed countries should be one of the parameters on which the Meeting should be built. Accordingly, the Secretariat had begun a process of informal consultations with representatives of least-developed countries. Following letters that were sent to the IMF, World Bank and UNDP, inviting these organizations to co-organize the High-Level Meeting with the WTO, ITC and UNCTAD, the Secretariat held its first inter-agency meeting on 20 March in WTO. The Secretariat had reported to her that this meeting had gone well; that the UNDP, World Bank and IMF were fully seized of the importance of the High- Level Meeting and were actively engaged in helping in whatever way they could to prepare for it, and that further regular meetings of an inter-agency nature would take place. As Ambassador Baichoo had already mentioned at the informal meeting of the Committee on Trade and Development on Wednesday, he, Mr. Richard Eglin from the Secretariat and herself would be visiting the World Bank and the IMF in Washington from 2-4 April, with a view to jump-starting the preparatory process. The Secretariat aimed to be in a position to circulate a draft Agenda for the High-Level Meeting by the end of April, based on the Joint Informal Note by the ITC, UNCTAD and WTO Secretariats, dated 13 February. A preliminary budget estimate was currently being prepared by the Secretariat. A Trust Fund had been set up in the WTO Secretariat. She urged any delegation who would be willing and in a position to make a financial contribute to the HLM, to do so by means of this Trust Fund. Although this Fund would be managed by the WTO Secretariat, the HLM would not be financed out of the WTO budget, but rather by individual governments, irrespective of their Membership of WTO or the United Nations.","WTCOMTDM15.pdf","Sub-Committee, Secretariat, UN, General, Assembly, Secretariat, IMF, World, Bank, UNDP, WTO, ITC, UNCTAD, Secretariat, WTO, Secretariat, UNDP, World, Bank, IMF, Ambassador, Baichoo, Committee, on, Trade, and, Development, Richard, Eglin, Secretariat, World, Bank, IMF, Washington, Secretariat, ITC, UNCTAD, WTO, Secretariat, WTO, Secretariat, WTO, Secretariat, WTO, WTO, United, Nations"

Thus far, an information gap existed in terms of activities offered by the World Bank and the IMF, especially regarding capacity building in LDCs. Since the proposed date for the Meeting at the end of June was only about 90 days away, his delegation was of view that this date was premature, raising concerns that the Meeting would be held, but would lack tangible achievements. His delegation was of the view that the Meeting should not be held at the end of June, but rather at a later stage. He requested the Secretariat to undertake logistical arrangements to consider alternative dates early in the Fall of this year. A later date would allow for greater coordination among co-organizers, and for consultations with the private sector. In regard to participation, he supported the inclusion of all least developed countries, regardless of WTO membership, all WTO Members as well as those governments who were in the process of acceding to WTO.","WTCOMTDM15.pdf","United, States, World, Bank, IMF, Secretariat, WTO, WTO, Members, WTO"

"992",992,"36","36.      The representative of Canada recalled that his delegation had initially proposed the idea of a High-Level Meeting. It's main purpose was to better integrate, as well as to enhance the efficiency of, trade-related technical assistance, with a view to ensuring avoidance of gaps or overlaps. He recalled that the discussions within this Committee in the Fall of last year, the contents of its report to the General Council, and the Ministerial Declaration done in Singapore had all emphasized the importance of an integrated approach in the trade-related technical assistance activities of the various Organizations, with special emphasis to increasing efficiency in the provision of technical assistance for human and institutional capacity building. Notwithstanding, his delegation could also support other elements, insofar as they were set out in the WTO Plan of Action for Least-developed Countries, including further market-access liberalization as long as that was understood to be on an autonomous basis. Delegates should be careful not to go beyond the parameters of what had already been agreed in the Plan of Action. His assessment of the present state of preparations for the High Level Meeting was less optimistic than that of the Chair. Important substantive elements of the meeting's agenda had yet to be agreed by Members; discussions with some of the institutions had indicated that a heavy participation and co-organizer status had not always shown the required enthusiasm. He cited a recent letter sent by the WTO to the World Bank and IMF, and expressed some doubt as to whether all delegations would support the ideas contained in this letter. In addition, he believed that discussion with these organizations thus far had not been as enthusiastic as anticipated. He was concerned about WT/COMTD/M/15 Page 8 the lack of engagement by Members in the preparatory process, as manifested by a lack of input for example through non-papers. The recent meeting of the Development Assistance Committee of the OECD had also made him less optimistic, as this meeting, (held primarily to discuss ways the DAC could contribute to a successful High Level Meeting), had been only sparsely attended by officials with a trade policy background. Greater national coherence between trade and development policies among DAC members had consequently not been advanced as much as had been hoped. For these reasons, he was of the view that holding the High-Level Meeting by the end of June would be risky and difficult. There was no question but that the main interest which had to be pursued was a successful conference which achieved some concrete results; the date was from this perspective of second order of importance.","WTCOMTDM15.pdf","Canada, Committee, General, Council, Singapore, WTO, Members, WTO, World, Bank, IMF, Members, Development, Assistance, Committee, OECD, DAC"

In order to keep this deadline, it was important to have a focused agenda which would lay the foundation for tangible results.

As regards the participation from governments at the Meeting, she said that it would be difficult to exclude members of other institutions, just because they were not a Member of WTO, and proposed that they would all be invited. Regarding the agenda, she said that the parameters were clear and were based on the WTO Plan of Action for Least-developed Countries. Further discussion on this point would delay the meeting further.

The Chairman recalled that the Secretariat had circulated general information about technical cooperation activities of the WTO in 1996 are contained in documents WTO/COMTD/W/14 plus Addendum 1, WT/COMTD/21 and WT/COMTD/23. Regarding implementation modalities, the Secretariat had circulated a revision of its non-paper on implementation modalities.3 At the Committee's last meeting, it was agreed that the Secretariat would revise the non-paper further to incorporate comments from delegations. He noted that no written comments had been received thus far, and urged that submissions be made quickly. He recalled that representatives from the ITC and UNCTAD had addressed the Committee at its last meeting in relation to technical cooperation activities of their respective organizations. Their comments had been incorporated into the Note of the Meeting.4 In addition, the Draft Annotated Outline for the Manual on Technical Cooperation and Training Activities had been circulated.5 It provided an overview of technical cooperation activities carried out by the WTO since its entry into force, and a synopsis of the Comprehensive and Integrated WTO Plan of Action for the Least-Developed Countries.6 The Draft Annotated Outline was merely indicative at this stage, and would benefit from the views of the delegations. He requested that the Secretariat finalize the Manual before the Committee's next meeting, planned for May. The Secretariat was also reviewing its technical cooperation programmes. This review took into account the various sources of funding presently available, including those financed by the WTO regular budget, the WTO Trust Fund for LDCs, and other ear-marked funds provided by certain Members. In conformity with the provision of Paragraph 4(a) of the Guidelines for Technical Cooperation,7 the Secretariat was in the process of preparing a comprehensive three-year plan, and the corresponding annual programme for 1997. In addition, the Secretariat was also preparing a computer-based interactive technical assistance and training package, to be used to introduce the WTO rules, rights and obligations in the same manner as through a general seminar. Its main support was a CD-ROM, but it would also be produced in a set of diskettes, taking into account hardware available in the beneficiary countries. Dissemination of the package would also, at a later stage, take place through the Trade and Development Web Site to be established under the WTO-World Bank Information Technologies for Development Project, in collaboration with other international institutions such as UNCTAD and the ITC.

The Chairman continued by saying that he wanted to share with delegations that he was exploring possibilities with senior management in the WTO to scale-up the technical cooperation activities of the WTO, in response to a general desire expressed by delegations.

"1016",1016,"9","9.       The representative of Switzerland presented proposals concerning the implementation modalities of WTO technical cooperation. He referred to the Secretariat's non-paper on implementation modalities, dated 3 February 1997. He cited Section 2, Paragraph A, and welcomed the idea that an official or an office be designated as the central point for interaction with the WTO, and suggested that it also serve the same purpose for all trade-related technical cooperation activities. Concerning Section 2, Paragraph B, he suggested that the selection of participants should also be done according to objective criteria to be defined by the Technical Cooperation and Training Division (the TCTD henceforth) of the Secretariat, and should include qualifications, experience, activities in the WTO relevant field, etc. Concerning Section 3, Paragraph C, he referred to the statement that the TCTD ""...shall, within the areas of competence and expertise of the WTO, develop, execute and participate in inter-agency programmes"" and asked wether the verbs “develop” and “execute” meant that it would become responsible for the elaboration and administration of inter-agency programmes. If so, he wondered if the Secretariat had the necessary experience and human resources to carry out such functions. Concerning Section 4, he recalled that the WTO Council had decided that extra-budgetary contributions for technical cooperation should be transferred into a Trust Fund, while such activities should follow the Guidelines for Technical Cooperation, and that the budgetary proposal should contain an estimate of work hours allocated by each WTO division. Since the Three-Year Plan would be the principal instrument to manage technical cooperation, he suggested that it be carried out in two stages. First, the TCTD should submit a draft Three-Year Plan no later than 1 September in the year preceding the projects proposed to ensure that they be consistent with the Guidelines for Technical Cooperation. They should contain descriptions and estimated costs, in addition to proposed funding for projects. The Budget Committee would then decide on the share of the regular WTO budget to be allocated, taking into account voluntary contributions to the Trust Fund. The Trust Fund should be composed of two windows, with one ear-marked for particular projects and one non-ear-marked. The non-ear- marked window could be used to finance any project from the Three-Year Plan. Contributions to the Trust Fund should be accepted only for projects which appeared on the Draft Three-Year Plan. In the second stage, the TCTD would propose a revised Three-Year Plan which would indicate the modes of delivery of every program, including the implications in terms of resources and the funding arrangements. The CTD would then adopt the finalized Three-Year Plan, if possible before the end of each year. Finally, he noted that his delegation would submit its proposals in writing, incorporating any suggestions from delegations.","WTCOMTDM15.pdf","Switzerland, WTO, Secretariat, WTO, Technical, Cooperation, and, Training, Division, Secretariat, WTO, WTO, Secretariat, WTO, Council, WTO, Budget, Committee, WTO, Trust, Fund, Trust, Fund, CTD"

"1023",1023,"14","14.      The representative of Trinidad and Tobago expressed the need for a revision of the document, since there were still some areas of confusion. He noted instances where the paper referred to activities by the Secretariat where no funding by the WTO was provided, and where the main thrust of the execution was with another organization, in particular World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO).  He noted certain areas, in the section on comments, where activities were subject to approval by the funding government and he wondered what would happen if approval was not granted. The question arose because it was not clear to his delegation what the basis was for funding from the regular budget as opposed to voluntary funds. In referring to number 146 in the Plan, (consultation on accession of the Russian Federation) he wondered what was meant by technical assistance. He did not consider such consultations with an acceding government and resulting travel by the Secretariat staff as technical cooperation in the strictest sense. He hoped that this be clarified in the revised paper. The document should reflect the existence of the Latin American and Caribbean Group. He wondered whether the document could reflect the steps which the Secretariat took to ensure quality control in technical assistance activities. When planning technical assistance activities on a three-year basis, basic reference and basic training materials were needed, which could have some permanence in the process of delivery of technical cooperation, over the wide membership of the WTO in the three-year plan period. He did not see any reference in the document to the creation of such training material. He wondered whether the use of information technology for distance learning and training would enable the funds available to the Secretariat to be more effectively utilized. There was a case to be made for the use of information technology to enable delivery of technical assistance to reach wider audiences at lower costs.","WTCOMTDM16.pdf","Trinidad, and, Tobago, Secretariat, WTO, World, Intellectual, Property, Organization, WIPO, Russian, Federation, Secretariat, Caribbean, Group, Secretariat, WTO, Secretariat"

Turning to some of the questions, he said that quality control, although important, was not appropriately addressed in the Plan, which was an inventory of activities. He drew attention to project number 148, which envisaged use of new technologies. Cost to the Secretariat in those items where ""no cost to Secretariat"" was indicated, meant that the WTO budget was not involved. Listing only those events which were solely organized by the WTO would shorten the Plan considerably, as many events were organized in collaboration with others.

Electronic dissemination would be an advantage, as it would ensure the possibility to constantly update the Manual. It would be useful if the results of High-Level Meeting on Least-Developed Countries be incorporated into the final version of the document, as these might have an impact on the Secretariat's technical cooperation activities. Regarding the issue of funding, on page 22 of the Manual, he recalled that on 18 July 1996, the General Council had set up a trust fund to collect voluntary contributions for the WTO technical cooperation activities. The relevant Decision stipulated that activities to be financed by the fund had to be in conformity with the priorities indicated in the Guidelines established for WTO technical assistance.

"1040",1040,"3","3.       The representative of the Secretariat drew attention to a number of examples of technical assistance. First, technical assistance regarded all the operational Divisions of WTO. The Three-Year Plan (the Plan) envisaged certain events which were not the sole constituents of technical cooperation activities. Technical cooperation activities were carried out by the Secretariat every day, with delegations, seeking advice on various problems. The work had increased after the establishment of the WTO, because implementation counselling was needed by delegations. He drew attention to thee examples of this counselling. In the Rules Division, delegations would bring in their proposed legislation for advice. These consultations were not reflected in the Three-Year Plan. Regarding the tariff schedules, technical assistance was being provided concerning the revision of the harmonized system or on issues of renegotiation pursuant to modification or withdrawal of concessions, which was done by WTO's Market Access Division. The Understanding on Rules and Procedures Governing the Settlement of Disputes required that the Secretariat provide technical assistance to developing countries in case of a dispute, which was usually done by the Legal Division. These were important illustration of the amount of work which was being carried out by the various Divisions by way of technical assistance, which were not reflected in the Three-Year Plan. He suggested that delegations take account of the vast area of technical assistance being provided which was not contained in the Three-Year Plan, when approving the Plan, which only dealt with seminars and workshops, mostly in the capitals. Second, one of the objective of the technical cooperation activities was to build a long-lasting and effective program for WTO Members. Specially in relation to least-developed countries, programs were conducted and repeated after intervals with a view to building and maintaining awareness of WTO framework. Third, the Secretariat needed the necessary flexibility in the implementation of its projects. WT/COMTD/M/16 Page 2 Since many actors were involved, there was always a risk of changes in timing and in participation, which needed to be accommodated.","WTCOMTDM16.pdf","Secretariat, WTO, Secretariat, WTO, WTO, Secretariat, WTO, Members, WTO, Secretariat"

He suggested to publish the Manual as a loose-leaf document to make it easier to update and more user friendly. Perhaps the Three-Year Plan could be incorporated.","WTCOMTDM16.pdf","Hong, Kong, WTO, Morocco, Norway"

The representative of Trinidad and Tobago referred to page 10 of the Manual (Modes of Delivery), and suggested to include a reference to training modules and distance learning with the help of information technology. The indication of information technology in the Three-Year Programme under its item 148 was not sufficient. The Internet was not necessarily the best way to deliver technical assistance. Teleconferencing and the creation of training modules on electronic media such as CD-ROM and diskettes should also be considered to allow for a repeatable means of delivering technical assistance.","WTCOMTDM16.pdf","Trinidad, Tobago"

The representative of Switzerland clarified that when he had referred to the Internet, it was not as a mode of delivery of technical assistance, but as a way of disseminating the information contained WT/COMTD/M/16 Page 6 in the Manual.

"1047",1047,"36","36.     The representative of Djibouti said that the least-developed countries, acceding countries and countries in transition considered the WTO training programs to be crucial. The existing courses which gave participants a chance to learn about the WTO and enabled them to meet with delegates and government officials from other countries as well as Secretariat staff, were ideal in their format.

"1050",1050,"39","39.      The representative of Switzerland thanked the representative of Djibouti for his positive impression of the modest Swiss contribution to the trade policy seminar organized by the WTO. Turning to the implementation modalities, he said that the his authorities' ideas were set out in a paper based on the Secretariat paper of 3 February 1997. The Swiss proposal reproduced that paper, but with suggested changes appearing in bold print. His delegation had tried to take on board comments made by Members as well as those made by the Secretariat. The major change was a simplification. It had first been suggested to present the Three-Year Plan in two stages. The first stage would include a draft on which Members would comment and donors could then have picked projects they wished to sponsor. During the second stage, the Committee would have accepted the draft. The Swiss proposal narrowed the procedure down to one stage. The first aim of the Swiss contribution was to ensure that technical assistance delivered by the WTO Secretariat was in line with the priorities and the objectives established by the Members. Second, that the WTO technical assistance was delivered in a transparent way so as to enable Members to follow developments and, if necessary, to contribute by giving orientation. His delegation hoped that with the modalities proposed, the Committee would manage to draw on the expertise of the WTO Secretariat.","WTCOMTDM16.pdf","Switzerland, Djibouti, WTO, Secretariat, Members, Secretariat, Members, Committee, WTO, Secretariat, Members, WTO, Members, Committee, WTO, Secretariat"
"1051",1051,"4","4.      The representative of the European Communities said that the document was a useful first step, which could be improved upon. Her delegation realised that it was mainly an indicative document. She suggested that it be updated, perhaps twice a year and to list the activities which had been confirmed as well as follow-up given. Some budget aspects needed to be clarified since it was not clear to her delegation what was meant by ""projects at no cost to WTO"".","WTCOMTDM16.pdf","European, Communities, WTO"
"1052",1052,"40","40.     The representative of Switzerland drew the attention of the Committee to a number of points in the proposal. First, it suggested some additional elements with respect to the presentation of the Three-Year Plan. It should be detailed for the first year, and there should be a description of each program including the mode of delivery chosen, and its implications on financial and human resources as well as the source of funding. Interesting ideas had been voiced during the discussion and his delegation was open to take on board comments made by the representatives of the European Communities and Morocco to classify the different activities of technical cooperation according to themes and according to the share taken on by the WTO in the implementation of the activities it carried                                                                              WT/COMTD/M/16                                                                              Page 7 out jointly with other organizations. His delegation would modify its proposal according to these and other comments made during the discussion. As regards the ""urgent requests"" referred to in paragraph 4.1(e) of the draft, it was the view of his delegation that these, during the first year, should only be taken into consideration if they were well founded. However, flexibility was needed and the wording ""bearing in mind the regular program"" left a certain room of manoeuvre for the Secretariat to interpret whether a given request should be followed up or not. He asked a clarification of the last part of the sentence in paragraph 5(b) of the Secretariat's note which read “... should include a sufficient flow of information and a permanent availability of technical expertise and advise”. It was the notion of ""a permanent availability of technical expertise and advise” which was not fully clear to his delegation.","WTCOMTDM16.pdf","Switzerland, Committee, Morocco, WTO, Secretariat, Secretariat"
"1053",1053,"41","41.      The representative of the Secretariat, in referring to paragraph 4.1(e), clarified that not only urgent, but also unforseen requests would be accommodated to the extent possible, bearing in mind the regular programme and its implications for financing and personnel. With reference to paragraph 5(b), the Secretariat would attempt a rewording. The paragraph meant to indicate that there would be programs, not on a one-off basis, but ensuring a continuity in the delivery of technical assistance activities, in particular in the case of the least-developed countries. The paragraph also intended to refer to improved electronic assistance, which was envisaged in due course and which would allow WTO to respond more promptly to requests for information and have an efficient two-way exchange. The Web site which was currently being developed in the WTO with its question and answer facility served as an example.","WTCOMTDM16.pdf","Secretariat, Secretariat, WTO, WTO"
"1054",1054,"42","42.      The representative of the European Communities said that, while the Swiss paper was a useful document, it attempted perhaps too much to micro-manage, and went into too much detail. Some points raised in the paper, such as coordination with other institutions, were important. In that context she suggested that, in addition to the World Bank, the Institute for Economic Development as well as the Vienna Institute which dealt with economies in transition could also be mentioned. Her delegation would come back to the paper at a later stage.","WTCOMTDM16.pdf","European, Communities, World, Bank, Institute, for, Economic, Development, Vienna, Institute"
"1055",1055,"43","43.     The representative of Canada welcomed the Swiss clarifications and cautioned not to introduce too much rigidity in the planning process, in particular with reference to some of the suggestions under paragraph 4.1. Such rigidity would hamper a certain degree of flexibility deemed desirable, which his delegation hoped was not its intended purpose. As regards the monitoring and follow-up exercise, which was useful, he suggested to set out from the beginning the expected outcomes of the programmes, by way of introducing some kind of benchmark against which to evaluate the programmes. His delegation considered the paper overall a useful framework and emphasised the need to ensure that the Secretariat would not spent too much time drawing up plans and reporting on them but rather implement them as faithfully as possible.","WTCOMTDM16.pdf","Canada, Secretariat"
"1056",1056,"44","44.    The representative of India said that his delegation found the earlier Secretariat Paper, dated 3 February acceptable.

"1057",1057,"45","45.     The representative of Morocco said that his delegation agreed with the Swiss views that a balance should be struck between flexibility and rigidity. Flexibility could only be achieved if based on specific points of reference, in the form of detailed rules of the sort suggested by the Swiss delegation. Implementation of such rules could be done in a more or less flexible manner, depending on the requirements of the beneficiary government. He was of the view that even more details were required that those set out in the Swiss paper. Since the WTO was innovating in this area, strict rules of the game needed to be drafted, with a view to creating a certain tradition. WT/COMTD/M/16 Page 8","WTCOMTDM16.pdf","Morocco, WTO"
"1058",1058,"46","46.     The representative of Norway welcomed the Swiss contribution as a means to create more predictability. An extensive work on planning would be justified if this work could generate more funds, extending the basis for technical assistance. While the paper could perhaps be reworded to avoid the impression of micromanagement, the paper should present as much predictability as possible as to how the funds were spent. He hoped that the paper could be finalized without undue delay.","WTCOMTDM16.pdf","Norway"

"1062",1062,"5","5.      The representative of New Zealand endorsed the Three-Year Plan. His government had made a contribution to the technical cooperation activities and would maintain the funding over the next three year planning period. It was desirable to maintain a consistent effort in this area. Members' long-term commitments would reinforce WTO processes, both on the part of donors and of the recipients, who would be making adjustments to their bureaucracies to adjust to their obligations under the WTO Agreements. He stressed the importance of flexibility, to accommodate both the recipient government and the Secretariat, facing competing demands on its staff. Finally, his delegation was interested in implementation modalities, and in this context, the paper circulated by Switzerland.","WTCOMTDM16.pdf","New, Zealand, Members, WTO, WTO, Secretariat, Switzerland"

"1065",1065,"52","52.      The Chairman recalled that, at its last meeting in March, the Committee had discussed its Work Programme for 1997. While agreement was reached on the Committee's work programme for the first half of the year, at least one delegation had said that it was not in a position to take a definite view at that time on a proposal that in the second half of the year the Committee undertake a review of the participation of developing countries in world trade. Would the Committee now be in a position to agree to place on its agenda at its September meeting an item entitled ""Review of the participation of developing countries in world trade"", and if so what guidance did they wish to give to the Secretariat in preparing background documentation to assist our discussions under this item? Referring to some statements made at the Committee's last meeting, he further suggested that before the Committee prepare its report to the General Council at the end of the year, an opportunity be given at the Committee's meeting in the autumn for delegations to comment on any aspect of another item in the Terms of Reference(TORs) of the CTD, in particular ""Review of the Application of Special Provisions in the Multilateral Trade Agreements and Related Ministerial Decisions in Favour of Developing Country Members, in Particular Least-Developed Country Members"", which might warrant delegations' attention. While delegations should not lose sight of this important item on the agenda, the Committee carried out a major review of the subject last year and he felt there was no need to repeat that exercise again until some more time has passed.","WTCOMTDM16.pdf","Chairman, Committee, Work, Programme, Committee, Committee, Committee, Secretariat, Committee, Committee, General, Council, Committee, CTD, Members, Members, Committee"
"1066",1066,"53","53.     The representative of Morocco suggested that the Chairman hold consultations on this matter and subsequently inform delegations of their results, by fax. Depending on their outcome a decision could be taken whether there was a need for the Committee to meet again on this issue.

"1067",1067,"54","54.      The Chairman said that this item had been placed on the agenda of the Committee's meeting in order that delegations be kept abreast of preparations for the High-Level Meeting on Least-Developed Countries and that this meeting seemed a timely occasion to do so. In this context, he recalled that the Committee on Trade and Development, at its meeting on 17 February had requested the Sub- Committee to follow up on the preparations initiated by the Committee on Trade and Development, under the usual guidance of the Committee itself. The Sub-Committee had accordingly taken up the matter under the leadership of its Chairperson, Ambassador Eveline Herfkens of the Netherlands. He placed on record his high regard and appreciation for the way in which she had launched the process and the energy she had brought to the task. He recalled that at its meeting on 18 April, the Sub- Committee on Least-Developed Countries had decided on the dates for the High-Level Meeting and that a review meeting be held jointly with UNCTAD at the end of June to carry forward the preparations for the High-Level Meeting. The date for this review meeting had been set for 26 June. Informal consultations would need to be held over the next couple of weeks to establish the agenda for the June meeting. The Secretariat had informed him that preparations for the High-Level Meeting were progressing well.","WTCOMTDM16.pdf","Chairman, Committee, Committee, on, Trade, and, Development, Sub, -, Committee, Committee, on, Trade, and, Development, Committee, Chairperson, Ambassador, Eveline, Herfkens, Netherlands, Sub, -, Committee, on, Least-Developed, Countries, UNCTAD, Secretariat"
"1068",1068,"55","55.     The representative of Morocco cautioned against establishing a double-track process. At this meeting, he would welcome a progress report from the Sub-Committee's Chair on the preparations for the High-Level Meeting and suggested that the Sub-Committee deal with any matter relating to the High-Level Meeting, to avoid taking up the work of the Sub-Committee in this Committee, including the agenda of the joint UNCTAD/WTO June meeting.","WTCOMTDM16.pdf","Morocco, Sub-Committee, Committee"
"1069",1069,"56","56.      The Chairperson of the Sub-Committee, Ambassador Herfkens, recalled that the Sub-Committee, at its meeting on 18 April, had agreed on the dates of the High-Level Meeting (27-28 October 1997), on the basic format of the Meeting, which would include Roundtable discussions, both on countries and on issues, on the need to avoid, if possible, a plenary session, and that the Meeting would be a common exercise with UNCTAD, ITC, UNDP and the Bretton Woods Institutions. In that context the Committee had cautioned that the exercise should not be micro-managed by one institution alone and had decided to organize a joint meeting involving the Geneva-based institutions on 26 June to review the preparatory process. The informal consultations on the agenda for this June meeting should be seen in this light. The Director-General of the WTO had sent letters to all 48 least-developed countries, spelling out the approach of the High-Level Meeting, and transmitting a checklist to assist the least developed countries in their determination of their needs for trade-related technical assistance. She recalled that the selection of the least-developed countries which would be ""featured"" at the High-Level Meeting itself in the Round tables would be done on the basis of their needs assessment. The checklist, which had been established in a common effort by all six participating institutions, also provided for the possibility to request technical assistance to help the LDCs in completing the checklist. Furthermore, background documents were being drafted by the participating institutions, in particular inventories of each of the institutions' trade-related technical assistance projects to the least-developed countries, a paper on the market-access conditions facing the exports of individual LDCs and a paper on the relevant use of information technology. Drafts of these papers would be discussed at the next inter-agency meeting on 29 May at which she intended to be present. She also recalled that, at the Sub-Committees' April meeting, she had announced the establishment of a trust fund (document WT/COMTD/LLDC/W/6, dated 1 May refers) and invited delegations to become donors to the trust fund. She also said that, before the meeting of the IMF/World Bank Development Committee in Washington, the Group of 24, which was the Group of 77 for the Bretton Woods institutions, had been discussing the High-Level Meeting, which had prompted telephone calls and letters to her from, in particular, Sub-Sahara African countries, which were not all least-developed. This had inspired her to hope that the High-Level Meeting would lead to other initiatives, covering a wider range of developing countries, which would be WT/COMTD/M/16 Page 10 benefitting from a similar type of exercise. She was encouraged by such signs of interest and commitment to the process on the part of the beneficiaries, given that any such initiative could only be successful, if really demand-driven.","WTCOMTDM16.pdf","Chairperson, Ambassador, Herfkens, UNCTAD, ITC, UNDP, Committee, Director-General, WTO, LDCs, IMF/World, Bank, Development, Committee, Washington, Group, Bretton, Woods"

"1071",1071,"58","58.      The representative of Bangladesh welcomed the initiative by the Director-General and confirmed that his government had received the letter and checklist. His authorities were confident and indeed had received signals that key players in global trading system would actively participate in the High-Level Meeting. His delegation was pleased that the Trust fund had been set up, and hoped that contributions from donors would be generous. The need for consultants for LDCs' preparations of needs assessments was well recognized and he was confident that the selection would be made in appropriate consultation with the beneficiary countries, or at least be tuned to their requirements. A format for NGO participation also needed to be worked out, which would ensure that NGOs not be so de-linked from the main event so as not to be able to benefit from or contribute to the High-Level Meeting. The universality in the global trading system could not be achieved without the least-developed countries. The High-Level Meeting was an opportunity to reverse the course of marginalization. It would help make the trading régime truly global and his delegation was confident to see some new approaches to this at the Meeting. It would also enable a more thorough integration of technical assistance activities among the various agencies in order to make the impact more results oriented. He welcomed the increased cooperation between not only WTO, UNCTAD and ITC but also between these bodies and the Bretton Woods institutions. The least-developed countries were hoping that increased market access for their products as well as expanded investments flows would be among the result of the High-Level Meeting. In this regard, they were also looking to the success of the pilot seminar, organized in June, by UNCTAD. He wondered if there would not be scope for an effective association in the preparatory process of the High-Level Meeting with UNIDO. The Denver Summit of the G-7 would no doubt have an important impact of the Meeting. To that end, the Prime Minister of his country had addressed a letter on behalf of the LDCs to the leaders of the G7 countries, with the objective to sensitise them as to LDCs' expectations and aspirations. He had information indicating that some leaders had already reacted with favourable action. The WTO had emerged over the past three years as an important player in the global trade field. The Committee and Trade and Development and its Sub-Committee on Least- developed Countries had a role in injecting a development orientation in WTO's goal and purposes, which was crucial for all developing countries in general and the LDCs in particular. This would also assist in generating the desired kind of political commitment to the WTO. The Committee on Trade and Development would therefore also need to have a significant role in the preparations of WTO's next Ministerial Meeting next year.","WTCOMTDM16.pdf","Bangladesh, Director-General, WTO, UNCTAD, ITC, UNCTAD, UNIDO, G-7, LDCs, WTO, Committee, and, Trade, and, Development, WTO, LDCs, WTO, Committee, on, Trade, and, Development, WTO"

His delegations had made suggestions concerning the implementation modalities. He would welcome more detailed information on the budgetary elements, both as far as the financial aspect was concerned and the allocation of resources.

Discussion under the Enabling Clause would of course remain in the CTD but the understanding of the TORs of the CRTA was such that information on regional trading arrangements notified under the Enabling Clause should be provided to it. Inevitably, there would be an issue raised by some of such arrangements which would require examination under the provisions of Article XXIV. The only basis on which to take such decisions would be a greater measure of transparency than hitherto had been the case. It was an issue which should be addressed to avoid loosing credibility over the Enabling Clause and this Committee's ability to deal with arrangements notified thereto.","WTCOMTDM16.pdf","United, States, CRTA, GATT, CRTA, Committee, CTD, CRTA, Committee"
"1087",1087,"72","72.      The Committee took note of the statements made and requested the Secretariat to compile a list of all regional trading arrangements notified under the Enabling Clause and to issue the list as a document of the CTD.

"1088",1088,"73","73.     The Chairman recalled that following guidance from the General Council, the CTD had granted observer status to a number of intergovernmental organisations. Document WT/COMTD/W/22 listed these organisations. As was also noted in that document, some requests for observer status from other intergovernmental organisations remained pending. On the basis of the General Council guidelines for observer status for intergovernmental organisations, he had conducted further informal consultations, and he was now in a position to propose to this Committee that it extend observer status to the African, Caribbean and Pacific Group of States (ACP) and Southern African Development Community (SADC). As regards other intergovernmental organizations, his informal consultations were continuing. The representative of Morocco suggested that the Chairman pursue his informal consultations on this matter with the Chairs of the other WTO bodies, in particular with the Chairman and the General Council. The Committee agreed to grant observer status to the ACP and SADC.","WTCOMTDM16.pdf","Chairman, General, Council, CTD, General, Council, Committee, Caribbean, Pacific, Group, of, States, ACP, SADC, Morocco, Chairman, WTO, Chairman, General, Council, Committee, ACP, SADC"
"1089",1089,"8","8.      The representative of Morocco was of the view that the Plan embodied the implementation of the Guidelines. While he considered it a useful first step, the Plan in its present form was not ready to be adopted and warranted more in-depth reflection on its presentation. For example, the event involving Morocco, as set out in number 67, was not a WTO, but essentially an UNCTAD event. He suggested that the Plan indicate, in cases where WTO was no the sole agency involved, what percentage of each project was WTO financed and what other agencies were involved in what measure.","WTCOMTDM16.pdf","Morocco, Morocco, WTO, UNCTAD, WTO, WTO"
"1090",1090,"9","9.      The representative of the United States considered the Plan a good first step in identifying the breadth of work undertaken by the WTO and by governments. It provided a good snapshot of the technical cooperation activities and the finances involved. His government had contributed to technical assistance programmes for countries in transition, with a view to making WTO as universal as possible. Some data supplied in connection with training for least developed countries would be of relevance in the preparation of the High Level Meeting on Least Developed Countries. His delegation would need more time, as certain elements needed more clarification, in particular in terms of the budget.","WTCOMTDM16.pdf","United, States, WTO, WTO"

Delegations had been invited to submit comments in writing within two weeks of that meeting. The paper had been shortened and the Secretariat had attempted to take on board comments made. The Manual provided a description of the technical cooperation and training activities available in the WTO and explained how Members should go about obtaining such assistance. He suggested that the Committee agree to the text, while at the same time asking the Secretariat to make any necessary adjustments in the light of the High-Level Meeting, and proceed to have the paper derestricted as soon as possible so that the Manual, which was not a legal document, could finally reach the public.","WTCOMTDM17.pdf","Chairman, Committee, Secretariat, WTO, Members, Committee, Secretariat"

The representative of Morocco said that although he saw the usefulness of having a document such as the Manual ready for the High-Level Meeting on Least-Developed Countries' Trade Development, his delegation preferred that the document be presented then as a provisional document to Ministers and delegates. For one, he found it too long, despite attempts to reduce it. He suggested that some parts could be included in the Annual Report of the Committee and that some details could be taken out. As it was his delegation which had asked for the document, he wished to inform the Committee that his delegation was making an effort to ask UNCTAD and ITC for the same type of documents. The idea was that the three documents would be compatible and comparable so as to enable delegations to better understand the technical cooperation activities of each organization.","WTCOMTDM17.pdf","Morocco, Committee, Committee, UNCTAD, ITC"

His delegation also had problems with the word ""integration"" on Page 6 when it referred to the ""full integration of beneficiaries into the multilateral trading system"".

He agreed with the Chair in that the document needed to be made public. It was necessary that the people in the different ministries in capitals and others who were to benefit from the WTO technical cooperation activities had access to it. His delegation had no difficulty in maintaining it as a provisional document.","WTCOMTDM17.pdf","Egypt, WTO"

Likewise, regarding the paragraph referring to private sector attendance, he suggested that it be clarified that these representatives would be invited by the governments concerned. Referring to the paragraph which dealt with acceding countries on Page 8 he proposed that, as had been done on Page 4 in the paragraph dealing with WT/COMTD/M/17 Page 4 developing countries, it would be better to cite the number of developing countries in the process of accession.","WTCOMTDM17.pdf","Pakistan, Geneva, WTO, Secretariat"
"1102",1102,"19","19.      The representative of the European Communities thought that the Manual would be useful for countries seeking technical assistance. Concerning the section on cooperation with other international organizations on Page 20, much more could be said in light of the High-Level Meeting on Least- Developed Countries' Trade Development, and it would be necessary to update the information after that Meeting. Regarding the reference to the establishment of the Subcommittee on Least-Developed Countries on Pages 4 and 5, he believed that the date was 1995, rather than 1996. Concerning the title, ""Increased need for technical assistance for developing countries” he suggested it be changed to “Increased need for technical assistance” as it also covered technical assistance for acceding countries which were not all necessarily regarded as developing countries by all Members.","WTCOMTDM17.pdf","Trade, Development, Members"

Following suggestions made at the last meeting, the Secretariat had improved on the paper and had introduced two new columns, one called ""WTO Funding"" and one called ""Other Funding"", thus separating the sources of funding from the column which indicated the organizing entity. Members would appreciate that the document showed an intensification of activities, which underlined the fact that demand-driven assistance by necessity led to frequent changes and in most cases additions to original plans. For example, the preparation of the High-Level Meeting and needs assessment missions undertaken in that connection had led to additional technical assistance for the least-developed countries beyond what was reflected in the original document. Since much of the first year of the 1997-1999 plan had lapsed, he suggested that the Committee took note of it at this point. He added that as provided for in the Guidelines and the Implementation Modalities, the Secretariat would provide the Committee with a Draft Three-Year Plan covering 1998-2000 for the next meeting.","WTCOMTDM17.pdf","Chairman, Secretariat, Secretariat, Members, Committee, Secretariat, Committee"

"1110",1110,"26","26.     The Secretariat noted that there had certainly been requests for technical cooperation for 1998.

"1111",1111,"27","27.     The representative of the European Communities said that the original document did not contain any specific activities for 1998 either. The document only mentioned areas of focus, which was not the same as requests for action. He was of the view that information about specific requests for activities in 1998 was still lacking.","WTCOMTDM17.pdf","European, Communities"
"1112",1112,"28","28.      The Secretariat said that the original idea for the Three-Year Plan for Technical Cooperation was that detailed information be given about the plan and the requests for the current year, but that for the subsequent two years only an indication of the types of areas that would be attended to was to be given. As it was difficult to get countries to focus and plan ahead regarding the type of technical assistance they were likely to request, it was hard to give specific information beyond a three-month period. The final response would, for most cases, only be available just prior to the event to be held. Even in the specific annual plan for the current year, many changes took place. Therefore, only a rough idea as to the activities of the two years furthest in the future of each Three-Year Plan could be given. Another Three-Year Plan would be presented to the Committee at its next meeting in which activities for 1998 would be described in greater detail and a rough idea would be provided of the activities planned for 1999-2000.","WTCOMTDM17.pdf","Secretariat, Committee"

He recalled that at the Committee's May meeting, a further period of two weeks had been provided so as to give the opportunity to Members to comment in writing. He believed that the note presented by the Secretariat achieved a careful balance among often diverging views.

He suggested that working documents be used in the future, and that document symbols only be given to adopted documents. Regarding the presentation, he suggested that an additional column be created which would separate WTO technical cooperation activities from those of other organizations. For those activities in which WTO involvement was limited to the participation of WTO experts at a meeting, no cost should be mentioned. It was enough to state that “WTO participated by sending experts”. It would thus be easier to identify the activities which were primarily initiated by the WTO.","WTCOMTDM17.pdf","Morocco, WTO, WTO, WTO, WTO, WTO"

It was distributed as an Addendum, and it was stated that it substituted pages 5-18 of the original document. Secondly, the Secretariat could segregate the WTO organized technical activities from those organized by others if the Committee so wished. In the current document, all the activities in which the Secretariat had participated in a year had been presented in alphabetical and chronological order. It was of course possible to segregate the activities into two groups, but as far as the Secretariat was concerned, the same amount of work was involved no matter whether the activity was initiated and organized by the Secretariat or by some other agency.","WTCOMTDM17.pdf","Secretariat, Members, Secretariat, WTO, Committee, Secretariat, Secretariat, Secretariat"

The representative of Morocco said that as his delegation did not believe that the same amount of work was involved no matter whether the activity was initiated and organized by the WTO Secretariat or by some other organization, his delegation wished to see technical cooperation activities organized WT/COMTD/M/17 Page 6 by other organizations accredited as such. He felt that it was fundamental that the WTO technical assistance be judged by the activities in which the WTO had the main responsibility.","WTCOMTDM17.pdf","Morocco, WTO, Secretariat, WTO, WTO"

With respect to the question from the European Communities regarding whether any Member had requested technical assistance for 1998, Colombia had requested WTO assistance in organizing a seminar on anti-dumping and safeguards to be held in Colombia in 1998.","WTCOMTDM17.pdf","Colombia, WTO, non-WTO, European, Communities, Member, Colombia, WTO, Colombia"

The second was documentation that was being prepared for the High-Level Meeting on Least-Developed Countries' Trade Development.

"1124",1124,"39","39.     The representative of India wished to make two points. Relating to paragraph 6 of the paper, his delegation suggested that the Committee might wish to examine the concern that in 1996 there was a slowdown in exports of textiles and clothing as that constituted an important export item for some Members. Relating to paragraph 20, his delegation did not fully agree with the statement that least- developed countries faced the same market access conditions in developing country markets as other exporters. Technical assistance and technical cooperation programmes provided by developing countries aimed at helping least-developed countries to get greater market access to the market of the developing country providing such assistance.

The representative of the United States said that it was of particular interest to his delegation to note what appeared to be an improved performance of developing countries in the last few years, particularly since the entry into force of the Uruguay Round Agreements and it appeared as if developing countries were breaking new ground in terms of their share of world exports.","WTCOMTDM17.pdf","United, States, Uruguay"
"1127",1127,"41","41.     The representative of Hong Kong noted that an issue which had attracted concern was the erosion of margins of preference as a result of a general lowering of tariffs after the Uruguay Round.

He agreed with India that the area of textiles was an area to consider further.","WTCOMTDM17.pdf","Hong, Kong, Uruguay, Round, Secretariat, India"
"1128",1128,"42","42.      The representative of Pakistan was of the opinion that Table 1 was too aggregated.

"1129",1129,"43","43.     The representative of the European Communities noted with interest that the share of developing countries as a whole in world trade had improved. It had been particularly strong in Asia and Latin America. There were differences among regions, and a region that continued to be a source of concern was Africa. This showed that it was right for WTO Members to focus on least-developed countries. Two other points made in the paper which were worth underlining were the contribution the advanced developing countries could make in improving access to their markets. That was something all Members should consider in the context of the High-Level Meeting. Second, the paper underscored the importance of least-developed countries having the right policy mix in place and of them adopting sound macroeconomic policies.","WTCOMTDM17.pdf","European, Communities, Asia, Latin, America, Africa, WTO, Members, Members"

"1131",1131,"45","45.     The representative of Uganda said that what clearly came out of the paper was that in spite of progress and deepening of structural reforms in least-developed countries, there was still a need for external assistance if the least-developed countries were to take advantage of the new trading environment. The sources of growth of least-developed countries' trade still were mainly exports of primary commodities and not of value-added manufactured goods. That was a fact which needed to be highlighted.","WTCOMTDM17.pdf","Uganda"

The Secretariat had in the past prepared a number of background documents on the status of preparations, which had been circulated to Members in documents WT/COMTD/W/28, plus Add.1 and Add. 2. WT/COMTD/M/17 Page 8 A document containing information on the NGO Symposium, which had started the previous day and which was still ongoing had been circulated in document WT/COMTD/LLDC/W/9.","WTCOMTDM17.pdf","Chairman, Secretariat, Members"
"1135",1135,"49","49.      The Chairperson of the Sub-Committee said that the High-Level Meeting had recently been discussed in depth at the meetings of the Sub-Committee and in UNCTAD. She said that the opening plenary would provide an opportunity for countries to announce market access initiatives for least- developed countries. She was fairly optimistic, both with regard to announcements to be made by developed and by developing nations in this regard. The meeting would then split into country-specific roundtables and thematic roundtables. As many needs assessments of sufficient quality to conduct roundtables had been received, it would be necessary either to have parallel country-specific roundtables or to attend to some least-developed countries before or after the High-Level Meeting.","WTCOMTDM17.pdf","Chairperson, UNCTAD"
"1136",1136,"5","5.       The representative of Morocco suggested that all documents relating to technical cooperation only be adopted at the Committee's last session of the year in order for delegations to be able to study them more. He found the document in question difficult to adopt. For example, he disliked the use of the term “donor Members” which was a notion that should be avoided. In addition, some delegations had made helpful suggestions to the section on Monitoring, Follow-up and Evaluation and he wished to know why those suggestions had not been incorporated in the document.","WTCOMTDM17.pdf","Morocco, Committee, Members"
"1137",1137,"50","50.      She said that the final list of countries to be showcased at the High-Level Meeting would be issued on 10 October. She wished to remind the least-developed countries that it was up to them to choose the chairman and the additional institutions and donors to be invited to their particular roundtables. Regarding the thematic roundtables, consultation held in UNCTAD had led to consensus on the themes to be discussed and on the participants in the roundtables. UNCTAD would take care of the organization of the roundtables. The Chairs of the two thematic roundtables might be Minister Pronk of the Netherlands and a least-developed country Minister. UNCTAD was carrying out consultations on those issues. The thematic roundtables would end up in plenary in the form of the documents embodying the recommendations to the inter-governmental institutions, to the governments of the least-developed countries and to the donor community at large. The aim was to endorse those recommendations in the plenary. The aim was also to endorse the paper on the Integrated Framework. It should be recalled that consultations had been held on the issue by Mr. Hoda and Mr. Fortin. They would hold further informal consultations and the document would then be distributed. Finally, a new version of the budget was expected at any moment as there had been a reluctance of donors to pledge on the base of the earlier budget. Partly because of the overheads and partly because three tickets per least-developed country was regarded by some donors as a bit exaggerated. A more modest budget could hopefully attract new commitments and she encouraged those in a position to do so to pledge as only Sweden had committed itself so far. Ambassador Lafer, the Chairman of the General Council was still holding consultations with a view to resolving the political problem of attendance of countries at the High-Level Meeting. Finally, she advised delegations to spend some time at the NGO conference as their contribution to the debate on the issues to be discussed at the High-Level Meeting would be useful.","WTCOMTDM17.pdf","chairman, UNCTAD, UNCTAD, Pronk, Netherlands, UNCTAD, Integrated, Framework, Hoda, Fortin, Sweden, Ambassador, Lafer, Chairman, General, Council"
"1138",1138,"51","51.      The representative of the European Communities said that in order for bilateral donors to play a useful role at the High-Level Meeting they would need to have the needs assessments shortly. It was not realistic to give bilateral donors only from mid-October to consider the needs assessments which had taken the Agencies much longer to consider. It was understandable that no final list of the least-developed countries to be featured at country-specific roundtables at the High-Level Meeting existed. However, there was a need to get the needs assessments as quickly as possible in order for the bilateral community to contribute. Second, a new paper on the budget was also needed in order to examine to what extent gaps could be filled. Third, a better integration of least-developed countries into the world trading system was a priority to which the European Communities was committed and the European Communities intended to circulate a paper on the issue. The paper would include a comprehensive three-prong approach. The first element was more generous market access to the European Communities' market. The second was the importance of economic reform in the least-developed countries themselves in order to help overcome supply-side constraints and in order to attract foreign direct investment. The third element was a more effective use of technical assistance.","WTCOMTDM17.pdf","European, Communities"
"1139",1139,"52","52.     He explained the recent move by the European Communities on market access. The European Communities was by far the largest market for exports from least-developed countries and it already gave generous market access conditions for products from least-developed countries. However, it wished                                                                             WT/COMTD/M/17                                                                             Page 9 to go further. On 20 June, the Council of Ministers of the European Union adopted the principle that the least-developed countries which were non-ACP countries be granted market access conditions to the European Communities' market equivalent to those of the Lomé partners. The Council of Ministers of the European Union had also backed a simplification of rules of origin and a possible cumulation of origin for least-developed countries. His delegation also wished to take the opportunity to reiterate a call on all developed and the most advanced among the developing countries to make a contribution to improve access to their markets for products from least-developed countries as well.","WTCOMTDM17.pdf","Council, of, Ministers, of, the, European, Union, Council, of, Ministers, of, the, European, Union"
"1140",1140,"53","53.      He went on to say that the second element of the European Communities' approach was that an active participation of least-developed countries themselves was expected, including in follow-up of any activity that would be agreed, as well as efforts to put the right domestic policies in place in line with the requirements of the global economy in order to attract foreign direct investment. The third element of the European Communities' approach was technical assistance. Technical assistance would be a central theme of the High-Level Meeting on Least-Developed Countries. His delegation supported the aim to get a more efficient disbursement and delivery of technical assistance. In developed countries there was a need to renew public support for development policies. The best way to do so was to show that development policies could be effective, and that the countries in need also made efforts. Those were the elements of the paper which he hoped would be circulated soon and that had been drafted at the Community level with a view to the High-Level Meeting on Least-Developed Countries.","WTCOMTDM17.pdf",""
"1141",1141,"54","54.     The Chairperson of the Sub-Committee said that the needs assessments of the least-developed countries would be circulated after 10 October. However, these papers were owned by the least- developed countries themselves, and the least-developed countries were free to approach those donors they considered relevant with their needs assessment. There was a difference between what the Secretariats that organized the High-Level Meeting could do and what the least-developed countries themselves, who owned these papers, could do. Some of the information problems could probably be resolved that way. Immediately after the preparatory inter-agency meetings, the Sub-Committee on Least-Developed Countries would hold a meeting where the outcome of the inter-agency deliberations would be reported.","WTCOMTDM17.pdf","Chairperson, Sub-Committee"
"1142",1142,"55","55.     The representative of Egypt hoped that informal consultations would be intensified in the coming few weeks as his delegation saw some loose ends which required additional consultations.

"1143",1143,"56","56.      The representative of Bangladesh thanked the European Communities for the significant announcement of the opening up to non-ACP least-developed countries of market access in terms of the Lomé Convention. If he had understood the representative of the European Communities right, the facilities would be dependent on certain conditions being met in the sense that right domestic reforms and right domestic policies needed to be followed. He hoped that the paper coming from the European Communities in this connection would be specific and lay out the exact initiatives, areas and policies that would be expected of the least-developed countries. It was his delegation's experience that the policy reforms in some least-developed countries had not always been properly understood in the least- developed country context. He therefore asked that the policy papers be simplified, detailed and time- bound and that they state explicitly what the requirements would be. Finally he hoped that other countries would follow the initiative of the European Communities in coming up with improved market access offers in favour of least-developed countries.","WTCOMTDM17.pdf","Bangladesh, European, Communities, European, Communities"
"1144",1144,"57","57.     The representative of Uganda took note of the statement made by the European Communities. It was necessary that the needs assessments be published as soon as possible, so that bilateral donors would be able to see how they could fit in. His delegation had no problem with its needs assessment WT/COMTD/M/17 Page 10 being distributed to donors and bilateral partners. He wished to stress the point that had been raised by Tanzania in the Sub-Committee on Least-Developed Countries regarding participation. The least- developed countries would most likely be represented at ministerial level and it was the hope of his delegation that the attendance from other participants would be at a high level too.","WTCOMTDM17.pdf","Uganda, Tanzania"
"1145",1145,"58","58.      The representative of Hong Kong, China asked whether the subject of market access for the products of least-developed countries would be on the agenda before the roundtables or whether market access would only be treated during the roundtables. His delegation hoped that it would be before, as Members should be able, under that Agenda Item, not only to announce autonomous market access offers but also to comment in general terms on the subject of market access for least-developed countries, and the systemic WTO and trade policy developments which might be affecting market access. The Agenda should be flexible enough to accommodate Members who might wish to make comments along this lines.","WTCOMTDM17.pdf","Hong, Kong, China, Members, WTO, Members"
"1146",1146,"59","59.      The representative of Morocco did not share the understanding of Hong Kong, China. His delegation's understanding was that the market access component of the High-Level Meeting would occur before the roundtables and that nothing but practical measures in favour of least-developed countries was to be discussed. As far as systemic issues were concerned, they had been discussed in the preparations of the Plan of Action and the limits of such discussions had become clear at that time. If practical results were wanted from a two-day meeting, no discussions relating to systemic issues or generalities should be entered into as those issues required time. For those reasons, his delegation thought that the understanding was not to have any discussion beyond announcements of practical measures. Bound market access for least-developed countries would have been ideal, but from experience gained at the Singapore Ministerial Conference it was clear that the WTO was not yet ready for that.","WTCOMTDM17.pdf","Morocco, Hong, Kong, China, Singapore, WTO"
"1147",1147,"6","6.      The representative of Switzerland said that his delegation generally was happy with the document although certain corrections could be made to its details. Document WT/COMTD/W/29 was dated 25 July, and long consultations had been held on it. The best approach was to adopt the document and not over-burden the Committee with work at the end of the year as several other exercises needed to be carried out at that time.","WTCOMTDM17.pdf","Switzerland, Committee"
"1148",1148,"60","60.     The representative of the Secretariat said that from conversations it had had with several delegations it felt that there was no need to issue a new budget covering only two delegates per least- developed country. It should be possible to finance the original budget as it stood. Regarding documentation, it was the aim to issue documents as soon as possible. It was the understanding of the Secretariat that it had been asked to produce, at the High-Level Meeting, an integrated response by six agencies to the needs expressed by least-developed countries. The Secretariat did not envisage having to organize extensive roundtables actively involving bilateral donors. Rather it envisaged an exercise of co-ordinating the activities of six agencies with the needs of least-developed countries. There would hopefully be a multiplier effect spreading from the exercise, but there was unfortunately not enough time at the High-Level Meeting itself to broaden the exercise further. Informal consultations would be continuing on various issues related to the High-Level Meeting. The Secretariat's appreciation was that the preparations were proceeding exceedingly well and that the High-Level Meeting would be a success.","WTCOMTDM17.pdf","Secretariat, Secretariat, Secretariat, Secretariat"

The Chairman noted that in a letter dated 20 July 1997 addressed to him in his capacity as Chairman of the Committee on Trade and Development, the President of the Islamic Development Bank had requested observer status in the Committee for Trade and Development. The Chairman said that he had replied that, in line with the procedure for granting observer status to international intergovernmental organizations in WTO bodies, the Islamic Development Bank had been added to the list of international intergovernmental organizations applying for observership status in this Committee. He had placed this request on the agenda of today's meeting in the hope that he might be in a position to propose that the Committee took action on this issue. He regretted that he was                                                                             WT/COMTD/M/17                                                                             Page 11 not in a position to do so.

"1151",1151,"63","63.      The representative of Pakistan said that his delegation had hoped that this would be a straightforward case which would meet the agreement of Members. In his delegation's view, the Islamic Development Bank squarely met the criteria laid down by the WTO for acquiring observer status by international intergovernmental organizations. His delegation had a number of reasons for saying so. First, the Islamic Development Bank was a development financing institution with the primary objective of promoting the social and economic development of its member countries. In pursuit of this objective it had focused its activities on trade promotion among its member countries. Moreover, the Islamic Development Bank had a global character as it comprised 52 Members from Africa, Asia, the Middle East, Central Asia and Latin America. The volume of its trade financing was around a billion dollars, and trade financing was a basic instrument of trade promotion. In light of this, his delegation did not see any reason for an objection to the Islamic Development Bank being granted observer status as it met the criteria of being trade related. It was an organization which was directly engaged in promoting international trade. His delegation hoped that Members would judge the request purely on its merits. In the current list of observers there were similar organizations which had already been granted observer status. He questioned why the Islamic Development Bank should get a different treatment.","WTCOMTDM17.pdf","Pakistan, Members, Islamic, Development, Bank, WTO, Islamic, Development, Bank, Islamic, Development, Bank, Members, Africa, Asia, Middle, East, Central, Asia, Latin, America, Islamic, Development, Bank, Members, Islamic, Development, Bank"

"1154",1154,"66","66.     The representative of Bangladesh said that his delegation was pleased to support strongly the Islamic Development Bank being granted Observer Status in the WTO Committee on Trade and Development. His delegation was of the opinion that this request deserved urgent and sympathetic consideration by Members of the Committee on Trade and Development on the ground of merit, some of which he wished to mention. Both the Committee on Trade and Development and the Islamic Development Bank shared a common area of work relating to trade and development. The Islamic Development Bank was a multilateral loan-giving financial institution which extended soft term development loans to its members under transparent and competitive rules and conditionalities. Its loans benefited Member countries, some of whom like Bangladesh were least-developed. The Islamic Development Bank financed directly export-enhancing and multilaterally trade increasing activities in its member states and it provided technical assistance of sizeable volume to its members to built capacity in a wide area of trade-related economic actions including for human resource development and trade diversification. In its operational pursuit it has been maintaining productive, informal liaison with a number of multilateral organizations like UNCTAD, UNDP and ITC, and its current membership of 52 cut across Asia, Africa, the Middle East and Central Asia. Most of these member states were also Members of the WTO. Considering the above, his delegation urged the delegations present at that day's session of the Committee on Trade and Development to consider positively the extension of immediate observer status to the Islamic Development Bank. Such a decision by the Committee on Trade and Development would be in its interest and would strengthen multilateral trade.","WTCOMTDM17.pdf","Bangladesh, Islamic, Development, Bank, WTO, Committee, on, Trade, and, Development, Members, Committee, on, Trade, and, Development, Committee, on, Trade, and, Development, Islamic, Development, Bank, Islamic, Development, Bank, Member, Bangladesh, Islamic, Development, Bank, UNCTAD, UNDP, ITC, Asia, Africa, Middle, East, Central, Asia, Members, WTO, Committee, on, Trade, and, Development, Islamic, Development, Bank, Committee, on, Trade, and, Development"

In this context, he recalled that the Committee had carried out a major review of the subject last year.

He suggested that it was more positive to replace “perhaps” by ""preferably"" in the penultimate line, as that was the approach that was being followed in the context of the design of an integrated framework for the least-developed countries; the rational behind it made sense in this connection too.

The Committee on Trade and Development should not try to make any points in it or to reflect the outcome of the High-Level Meeting. The High-Level Meeting was not that important for the purpose of the Manual, other than that it was a historical fact. In that light, most of the comments seemed irrelevant. A concise, short document was needed on WTO technical cooperation.","WTCOMTDM18.pdf","Morocco, WTO, Committee, on, Trade, and, Development, WTO"

He suggested that the Manual could have several versions according to its use.

The representative of the International Trade Centre (ITC) explained that ITC's objective in producing its manual on technical cooperation had been to produce a short document to explain to its clients and partners what the ITC was all about as distinct from an annual report where ITC reported at length on what had happened throughout the year. The objective had been to spell out in as brief, as clear, and as business-like a manner as possible what ITC's areas of specialization were, how to go about requesting assistance from ITC, how ITC worked with its partners and ITC's own approach to technical assistance.","WTCOMTDM18.pdf","International, Trade, Centre, ITC, ITC, ITC, ITC, ITC, ITC, ITC, ITC"

While some delegations had mentioned that the document was lengthy and should be shortened and made more reader-friendly, other delegates had mentioned the need for updating, taking into consideration various suggestions that had been made and for maintaining certain sections.

As regards the relationship between the Integrated WTO/UNCTAD/ITC Technical Assistance Programme for Selected Least-Developed and Other African Countries and the Integrated Framework on Trade Related Technical Assistance, endorsed at the High-Level Meeting, this was explained in Supplement 1 to the Manual.

"1189",1189,"22","22.      The Chairman recalled that the Secretariat had prepared the Three Year Plan for technical cooperation activities for 1998 - 2000, contained in document WT/COMTD/W/32 with a revision circulated shortly before the meeting in document WT/COMTD/W/32/Rev.1 to incorporate additional activities deriving from the follow-up to the High-Level Meeting on the Least-Developed Countries and to include in more precise terms their estimated financial implications.","WTCOMTDM18.pdf","Chairman, Secretariat"
"1190",1190,"23","23.      The Secretariat introduced the document by saying that it had been prepared pursuant to the Guidelines for Technical Cooperation adopted by the Committee on Trade and Development last year. Revision 1 affected the figures quoted in paragraph 13 and incorporated into Annex 1A a number of new activities as follow-up to the High-Level Meeting and certain revisions on sources of funding. The short time available since the High-Level Meeting had made it possible to circulate document WT/COMTD/W/32/Rev.1 only in english for the meeting. French and spanish versions would be circulated as soon as possible. As Members might recall, the present plan was only the second triennial plan prepared under the Committee's procedures, and the first one that was actually presented to the Committee prior to the initiation of an annual programme. The 1997 - 1999 plan had been presented in May 1997, and an addendum on 1997 activities had been provided to the Committee last August. He mentioned this only to highlight the very dynamic nature of technical cooperation activities and the need for the Secretariat to always be ready to respond in a flexible manner to requests for technical cooperation activities which it received on a continuous basis.","WTCOMTDM18.pdf","Secretariat, Committee, on, Trade, and, Development, Members, Committee, Committee, Committee, Secretariat"
"1191",1191,"24","24.     The Secretariat further said that some changes had been made in the presentation of the Three Year Plan, both in form and in substance. These changes endeavoured to respond to comments made by Members on the previous plan and to improve the document and the planning process describing the broad framework within which activities were designed and planned. Thus, document WT/COMTD/W/32/Rev.1 contained an introductory section (paragraphs 1 through 17) which illustrated some of the lessons learned through the experience of the previous plan, and described the process of preparation of the document, detailed its structure, provided some preliminary rough budgetary estimates, and summarized, along broad lines, the global objective of the Secretariat's technical cooperation activities. That objective was always evolving.","WTCOMTDM18.pdf","Secretariat, Members, Secretariat"
"1192",1192,"25","25.      The Secretariat continued by saying that the document indicated the broad lines of action for the Secretariat's technical cooperation activities on different WTO subjects for 1998 and 1999 which, for 1998, had been complemented with the detailed list of activities in Annex 1. In response to comments by delegations, Annex 1 had been split into three categories: 1A contained activities fully organized and financed by the WTO; 1B listed activities organized jointly with other organizations, or activities organized by other organizations in which the WTO had a major role; and 1C contained activities to which the WTO had been invited to participate by others. For the year 2000, a brief statement was made, indicating likely future priorities. Many delegations had responded to an invitation by the Secretariat to send in requests for technical cooperation activities by 15 October 1997. It was clear that this target date did not prejudge the presentation of requests at a future time, nor the continuous efforts to respond to them, as was the customary practice. Among the delegations that had responded to the invitation were Bangladesh, Bolivia, Bulgaria, Cyprus, Guatemala, Indonesia, Kazakhstan, Korea, Moldova, Mongolia, Pakistan, Qatar, and regional organizations such as the Forum Secretariat for the Pacific Island Countries and the Commonwealth Secretariat. Where these requests had been precise enough, some concrete activities had been included in Annex 1; in other cases, further consultations with the delegations concerned were needed to define the concrete activities to be undertaken. The                                                                             WT/COMTD/M/18                                                                             Page 5 plan also incorporated programmes being developed with the World Bank and regional development banks such as the Asian Development Bank, the Islamic Development Bank and the Inter-American Development Bank.","WTCOMTDM18.pdf","Secretariat, Secretariat, WTO, WTO, WTO, WTO, Secretariat, Bangladesh, Bolivia, Bulgaria, Cyprus, Guatemala, Indonesia, Kazakhstan, Korea, Moldova, Mongolia, Pakistan, Qatar, Forum, Secretariat, Pacific, Island, Countries, Secretariat, World, Bank, Asian, Development, Bank, Islamic, Development, Bank, Inter-American, Development, Bank"
"1193",1193,"26","26.      The Secretariat viewed the Three Year Plan as its main programming instrument, which would facilitate both the task of the Secretariat and that of the Committee in relation to technical cooperation activities. It had already proven to be a useful tool in the Secretariat's own internal process for the management of technical cooperation activities. With assistance from Members, the Secretariat would continue to improve it and develop it into its' main programming tool. For these purposes, the Secretariat was in the process of designing an improved data base which would include a mission management system. He expected this data base to be ready in a few months. In that manner, the Secretariat expected to continue providing its Members with the best technical cooperation services possible.","WTCOMTDM18.pdf","Secretariat, Secretariat, Committee, Secretariat, Members, Secretariat, Secretariat, Secretariat, Members"
"1194",1194,"27","27.      The Chairman highlighted a few items mentioned. First, the flexibility with which the Secretariat responded to needs for technical cooperation. Second, that changes had been made to the document in response to comments by Members on the previous Plan. Third, the format had also been changed as a result of comments by Members. Last, that preliminary rough budget estimates were important. In that respect he had consulted the Secretariat prior to the Meeting and it had become clear that a word about financial implications was called for. Paragraph 13 of document WT/COMTD/W/32/Rev.1 contained preliminary estimates on the basis of rough calculations, as stated therein. These estimates included those related to the agreed follow-up to the High-Level Meeting for the Least-Developed Countries. Whereas the WTO Trust Fund for technical cooperation would have a substantive balance at the end of this year, and a new contribution had been announced at the High-Level Meeting itself, it was clear that the utilization of these funds had to be staggered, as a minimum, over the next two years - 1998 and 1999 - and that not all of them could be exclusively used for the High-Level Meeting follow-up. In that context, the Secretariat's preliminary estimate of the possible shortfall in 1998 for High-Level Meeting follow-up purposes, as mentioned in paragraph 14, was in the order of approximately SwF 1 million. Moreover, the estimates in the Three Year Plan did not include the financial implications of activities that might have to be undertaken in relation to the least-developed countries which had not been the subject of Round Tables during the High-Level Meeting, and where needs assessments and other activities at the national level might be required. He was not suggesting to initiate a debate on that issue at the current Committee on Trade and Development meeting, but only to flag the point to stress the need for consultations, in an appropriate framework, between the Secretariat and the delegations mainly concerned.","WTCOMTDM18.pdf","Chairman, Secretariat, Members, Members, Secretariat, WTO, Secretariat, Committee, on, Trade, and, Development, Secretariat"
"1195",1195,"28","28.      The representative of the European Communities welcomed paragraph 13 which gave a detailed idea of the budget situation. She asked the Secretariat whether it would be feasible to add yet another column to the tables in the document which would indicate, in a preliminary way, the cost of the individual programmes mentioned.","WTCOMTDM18.pdf","Secretariat"
"1196",1196,"29","29.      The representative of Guatemala said that the document reflected the objectives and the needs for technical cooperation within the WTO while maintaining the flexibility required to face an evolution of needs and to best achieve the objectives. A new format had been put before delegations which facilitated the organization of activities. The increased number of requests for technical cooperation showed the growing interest of developing Members to integrate into the multilateral trading system and constituted a recognition of the benefit that those countries derived from that system. Her government had given priority to integrate its economy into the multilateral trading system and recently decided to strengthen the necessary structures for dealing with the matters within the remit of the WTO. This included the setting up of a mission to the WTO which would become operational in 1998. Within the effort to accelerate the adaptation of Guatemala's policies, rules and regulations to WTO standards technical cooperation was indispensable, including joint inter-organizational cooperation. She hoped WT/COMTD/M/18 Page 6 that her country's efforts would meet with the necessary feed-back so that her country could more effectively contribute to strengthening the multilateral trading system. Her delegation was of the view that the national seminar requested in Annex 1A, item 17 by the government of Guatemala would have a great impact as it would permit her country to define a national programme.","WTCOMTDM18.pdf","Guatemala, WTO, Members, WTO, WTO, Guatemala, WTO, Guatemala"

The representative of Japan said that his delegation did not wish to change the current text of the document but suggested that an addition to the document be made to the effect that an Integrated Framework for Trade-Related Technical Cooperation had been endorsed by the High-Level Meeting on Least-Developed Countries.","WTCOMTDM18.pdf","Japan, Integrated, Framework, for, Trade-Related, Technical, Cooperation"
"1198",1198,"30","30.      The representative of Bangladesh said that his delegations comments related to document WT/COMTD/W/32 as his delegation had not had sufficient time to consider Revision 1. of the document. Paragraph 5 of document WT/COMTD/W/32 gave an encouraging picture as it showed a sharp rise in the number of technical cooperation activities undertaken. Four categories of consumers of technical cooperation were identified; LDCs, developing countries, transition economies and acceding countries. His delegation would appreciate receiving information about the distribution of activities among those four categories. Paragraph 7 mentioned increasing trends towards activities at the regional level; in this context his delegation wished to know how much of the available resources went to each region. His delegation urged the Secretariat to give delegations more lead-time in the future to consider documents as delegations needed to consult capitals. Paragraph 16 provided the global objectives and mentioned the priority placed by Members to integrate the LDCs into the multilateral trading system as well as the High-Level Meeting. However, when the activities in Annex 1A were counted, only sixteen of the ninety-two activities related to the High-Level Meeting, a figure that, in his view, did not reflect a very high level of attention to LDCs. Although he did not deny that LDCs were involved in other activities as well, sixteen out of ninety-two was not a very encouraging figure. In 1B, only one activity out of sixteen emanated from the LDC needs. His delegation also felt that information technology was an important issue where more resources should be invested than could be understood from the poor attention it had been given in the document. The document stated that technical cooperation was demand driven. His delegation questioned whether it was really demand-driven when the table already was laid out for three years with times, schedules, venues and subjects already in place. Until the consumers were fully integrated in the preparation of this menu, the claim of demand-driven did not stand on solid ground. However, he realized the difficulties involved and was convinced that at least Geneva-based delegations could be more actively involved. Last, regarding the management of the process, there had been information gaps between missions, capitals and the WTO and his delegation found itself mid-stream between the two, not knowing what either one was doing. He was convinced that it would be possible to find a well-functioning institutional system of communication between these three entities.","WTCOMTDM18.pdf","Bangladesh, Secretariat, Members, LDCs, LDCs, LDC, WTO"
"1199",1199,"31","31.      The representative of Switzerland said that the new document was a clear improvement over the first Three Year Plan. His delegation particularly appreciated the information given in the introductory paragraphs. Paragraph 6 to 13 mentioned, in general terms and in different places, that the Secretariat was put under a lot of pressure from the increased demand for technical assistance. His delegation was of the view that no particular activity should hinder the regular work of the Secretariat. If that should be the case his delegation expected the Secretariat to report such problems to the Committee on Trade and Development or to the relevant body of the WTO. Given the shortage of resources, it might be important to prioritize the activities at some stage. The Secretariat could for example give priority to those activities which corresponded most narrowly to the objectives and principles stated in the Guidelines for Technical Cooperation. Concerning paragraph 13, he noted that several trust-funds were mentioned while in his delegation's understanding there was only one WTO trust-fund for technical cooperation activities which had been established under paragraph b of the Decision of the General Council of 18 July 1996 and which had followed the rules contained in that Decision. Those rules were essential for ensuring transparency and efficiency of WTO technical cooperation activities. With respect to the 1998 activities, he said that it would be useful to explicitly enumerate those activities which related to every section of activities. It would be helpful to relate every particular activity to the section in the main part. For example, section 1.1 on the Agreement on Agriculture, in its third paragraph stated that ""The Annex shows, in particular, two regional seminars on the Agreement on Agriculture..."". It would be useful if these two regional seminars referred to                                                                             WT/COMTD/M/18                                                                             Page 7 would be mentioned by number. With respect to Annex 1 he said that the paper could be improved upon along the lines suggested by other delegations. First, section 4.1(d) of the Implementation Modalities stated that ""...the Three-Year Plan shall indicate for every proposed activity ... (iv) the executing unit and human resource utilisation..."". His delegation suggested that an indication of the human resource utilization be given, as well as the financial implications in a separate column. Another useful improvement would be to have a more detailed description of the project in connection to column two, containing the description and mode of delivery for each activity. This would be particularly appreciated by the sponsoring bodies in capitals in order to determine their priorities.","WTCOMTDM18.pdf","Switzerland, Secretariat, Secretariat, Secretariat, Committee, on, Trade, and, Development, WTO, Secretariat, WTO, General, Council, WTO"
"1200",1200,"32","32.      The Secretariat said that it would respond to the requests for additional information in the next revision of the document. He said that the sharp expansion of technical cooperation activities affected not only the Technical Cooperation Division, but also the operational divisions. After reviewing the latest plan, a number of operational division directors felt that the set of activities programmed for 1998 went beyond the capacity of the resources available. They had pointed out that the same staff were used for dispute settlement, and that if there were an increase in dispute settlement cases it would not be possible to give all the technical assistance requested. The Secretariat was therefore considering engaging consultants in a limited number of cases where it could be assured that they were able to do the job. He added that in the past six months three of the nine staff members in the Technical Cooperation and Training Division had been locked up in preparing several versions of the Three Year Plan and other work related to documents which had been asked for by the Committee on Trade and Development. The more details delegations asked for, the more time his staff would have to spend on preparing documents instead of being in the field and actually delivering technical assistance. He requested delegations to bear this in mind when requesting greater detail. This applied for example to the request for including financial information. The Secretariat was currently not certain of the venue for various regional activities and the amount spent on each activity depended, among other things, on the venue. Also, exchange rates varied every day and it was therefore difficult to give exact financial requirements for each specific activity. He suggested that delegations contact the Secretariat directly if they wish to have an indication of the financial requirement of a particular project.","WTCOMTDM18.pdf","Secretariat, Technical, Cooperation, Division, Secretariat, Technical, Cooperation, and, Training, Division, Committee, on, Trade, and, Development, Secretariat, Secretariat"
"1201",1201,"33","33.      The Secretariat further said that regarding the allocation of resources to LDCs, the latest budget showed that the allocation to LDCs was SwF 1.9 million out of a total of SwF 4.8 million, which gave a more accurate picture of the activities focused on LDCs. It was not accurate to go by the number of activities since for example two items for LDCs were special training programmes that had been introduced for the LDCs, one for the French-speaking and one for the English-speaking countries. Those programmes were not just two programmes like the other ones as they related to 40 countries. Intensive training would be given to officials from these countries and a considerable amount of the Secretariat's financial and personnel resources would be absorbed by those programmes. Should one still wish to count the activities, the right figure of activities relating to LDCs would amount to 25 out of 94. In response to the question of whether the activities were being truly demand-driven in establishing a three year plan, he recalled that the three year plan was a requirement from the Committee on Trade and Development. In planning the current Three Year Plan, the Secretariat had been guided by the type of requests it received from Members. The specific programmes were established just before the beginning of each year and were almost entirely demand-driven. Demand-driven meant that the Secretariat would not impose a programme on the country concerned. If in a region there was a demand from four to five countries, regional activities would be planned without waiting for a request from all others in that region. The activity would then be proposed and it would be up to each country to participate or not. Demand-driven had to be given a realistic meaning.","WTCOMTDM18.pdf","Secretariat, Secretariat, LDCs, Committee, on, Trade, and, Development, Secretariat, Members, Secretariat"

"1203",1203,"35","35.     The representative of Switzerland recalled that the Guidelines for Technical Cooperation, section 4(a) stated that the ""Three Year Plan adjusted on an annual basis, including budgetary implications, to be approved by the Committee on Trade and Development and to be submitted to the appropriate bodies of WTO, according to agreed procedures and decisions of the General Council"". He was aware of the fact that the Budget Committee and the General Council had already approved the budget for 1998. There was thus no point in setting up a procedure at this stage. However, his delegation requested that in subsequent years the Committee have its discussions on this item at an early date for adoption and subsequent submission to the Budget Committee and other relevant Bodies.","WTCOMTDM18.pdf","Switzerland, Committee, on, Trade, and, Development, WTO, General, Council, Budget, Committee, General, Council, Committee, Budget, Committee"
"1204",1204,"36","36.        The Secretariat said that the Guidelines envisaged approval of the Three Year Plan. However, in earlier discussions of the Three Year Plan in the Committee on Trade and Development, several delegations had expressed a preference for taking note rather than approving it, as they felt that an approval of expenditure in the Committee on Trade and Development would imply certain budgetary commitments. Moreover, the Three Year Plan had been turned into a rolling plan. A certain amount of information on what was going to be included in the technical cooperation activities in 1998 was available at the present stage. However, he hoped that many more requests were going to be received, and unfortunately, some requests which had already been made might be taken out for various reasons. The Secretariat therefore felt that the best way to proceed was for the Committee to review the Three Year Plan appropriately revised in successive meetings, although not in every meeting, and take note of it at each stage. This line of procedure seemed to have been confirmed by earlier Committee meetings.","WTCOMTDM18.pdf","Secretariat, Committee, on, Trade, and, Development, Committee, on, Trade, and, Development, Secretariat, Committee, Committee"

The representative of Switzerland said that if it was an issue of principle, which meant that by taking note the Committee on Trade and Development had somehow sanctioned the procedure of taking note regularly of the Three Year Plan, then his delegation had to reserve its position for the moment. There was also a question of credibility involved. It was the role of the Committee to judge first the content of the activities in the Three Year Plan, subject to which the Budget Committee would then be asked to approve budgetary appropriations. Even if the Three Year Plan only contained estimates and predictions about projects and contained a measure of uncertainty, a procedure ensuring credibility of WTO activities was called for. His delegation could therefore not accept the procedure to take note of the Three Year Plan as a regular procedure.","WTCOMTDM18.pdf","Switzerland, Committee, on, Trade, and, Development, Committee, Budget, Committee, WTO"

The debate should allow the Committee to evaluate to what extent and how the different provisions were applied or used by developing countries since the Committee's review last year. He also wished to encourage delegations to provide the Committee with information as to their experience with the implementation of provisions since some of the provisions in favour of LDCs were triggered only if specific requests were made.","WTCOMTDM18.pdf","Chairman, Committee, on, Trade, and, Development, Committee, Secretariat, Secretariat, Uruguay, Committee, Committee, Committee, LDCs"

The representative of Pakistan noted that the Committee on Trade and Development was the forum to deliberate upon all the aspects of the issue and that Items three and four of the Committee's terms of reference were relevant for that purpose. Specifically, Item four of the Committee's terms of reference mandated the Committee to consider any question that might arise with regard to the application of special provisions in the multilateral trading agreements and related ministerial decisions in favour of developing countries and to report to the General Council for appropriate action. The experience of developing countries in the multilateral trading agreements and related ministerial decisions in the past two years had raised certain questions which had to be discussed in the Committee.","WTCOMTDM18.pdf","Pakistan, Committee, on, Trade, and, Development, Committee, Committee, Committee, General, Council, Committee"
"1212",1212,"43","43.      The representative of Pakistan continued and said that, for a proper perspective it was important to note that special and differential treatment for developing countries constituted an integral part of Members' contractual obligations. Part IV of GATT 1947 had been negotiated in recognition of special conditions and needs for developing countries in view of their level of development. Part IV was still relevant as it had been incorporated into GATT 1994 by inference. Many other specific provisions for special and differential treatment of developing countries were also included in different WTO Agreements under the Uruguay Round. It should also be noted that these provisions aimed at creating a balance as developing countries had accepted wider and more strenuous obligations in many areas during the Uruguay Round. It was therefore imperative that the provisions for special and differential treatment of developing countries, as embodied in WTO Agreements, were fully implemented so that the balance of rights and obligations would be maintained.","WTCOMTDM18.pdf","Pakistan, Members, GATT, GATT, WTO, Uruguay, Uruguay, WTO"
"1213",1213,"44","44.      The representative of Pakistan went on to say that the information contained in document WT/COMTD/W/33 needed to be supplemented in several areas and, in addition, certain questions needed to be addressed. Those concerned some of his delegation's specific concerns. First, the Secretariat not did not provide information with regard to all the provisions in favour of developing countries in the multilateral agreements and ministerial decisions. A complete compilation of all the provisions had been prepared in document WT/COMTD/W/510 in November 1994. A comparison of the present document with the 1994 compilation showed that almost half the provisions had not been reported upon. Second, even in the present document, many provisions had been mentioned without any information regarding their implementation. Some of these provisions were Articles 10:1 and 10:2 and Annex B, paragraph 2 of the SPS Agreement, Articles 12:2, 12:3, 12:5, 12:6, 12:9 of the TBT Agreement, Annex III, paragraph 5 of the Agreement on Customs Valuation, Articles 1:2 and 3:5(j) of the Agreement on Import Licensing Procedures, Articles 27:7, 27:8, 27:9 and 27:15 of the Agreement on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures, Articles 66:2 of the TRIPS Agreement, etc. Third, there was a number of provisions in the present document where the information given in the column for implementation was not complete. Most of the responses on provisions in the dispute settlement understanding fell into that category. It was, for those reasons, difficult to obtain a complete and satisfactory understanding of the status of the implementation and use of special provisions in favour of developing countries.","WTCOMTDM18.pdf","Pakistan, Secretariat, Annex, III, Customs, Valuation, Import, Licensing, Procedures"
"1214",1214,"45","45.    The representative of Pakistan further said that after careful reading of the document, his impression was that most of the provisions were yet to be properly operationalized. Keeping in mind the importance of the issue for developing countries and the mandate of the Committee on Trade and WT/COMTD/M/18 Page 10 Development in this regard, his delegation suggested that the Committee should arrange for an in-depth consideration of the issue in order to ensure that all the provisions in favour of developing countries were implemented. To facilitate such a consideration by the Committee his delegation requested the Secretariat to update the document WT/COMTD/W/33 by seeking full and complete information regarding all the provisions in favour of developing countries from the relevant divisions of the WTO. These could also provide, where appropriate, the reasons for non-implementation. That information would help the Committee in identifying clearly the provisions that had not been operationalized so far, and, at least in some cases, the reasons for such non-implementation. His delegation proposed that the information should be collected before the next meeting of the Committee and that the item be placed on the Agenda of the Committee's next meeting. The Committee would then be in a position to hold in-depth discussions and report to the General Council for appropriate action. His delegation would, for its part, be working to identify some important provisions that needed to be operationalized and might present, in an informal paper, suggestions on ways to operationalize those provisions.","WTCOMTDM18.pdf","Pakistan, Committee, on, Trade, Committee, Committee, Secretariat, WTO, Committee, Committee, Committee, Committee, General, Council"
"1215",1215,"46","46.      The representative of Egypt said that his delegation supported the gist of the intervention made by the representative of Pakistan. His delegation attached great importance to the issue of special and differential treatment for developing countries. It was an integral part of the balance of rights and obligations in various Agreements. He realized that it was sometimes difficult for the Secretariat to evaluate and pronounce itself on the effectiveness of the implementation of various provisions. His delegation was aware of the fact that some of the provisions were of a general nature and needed to be made operational. It was working on some specific ideas in that respect which it hoped to present to the Committee on Trade and Development shortly. He suggested keeping the item on the Agenda. and reiterated that proper implementation of the special and differential treatment to developing countries would send a positive signal for future anticipated negotiations on the built-in agenda. If developing countries felt that those provisions were being faithfully implemented, it would facilitate their approach to future negotiations.","WTCOMTDM18.pdf","Egypt, Pakistan, Secretariat, Committee, on, Trade, and, Development"
"1216",1216,"47","47.      The representative of India said that his delegation fully supported the statement made by the representative of Pakistan. Since document WT/COMTD/W/33 was rather incomplete he suggested that it be completed incorporating all points made by the delegation of Pakistan. Only a few of the special and differential provisions in favour of developing countries had been implemented. He stressed the need for the implementation of those provisions and strongly supported that the document be updated and presented to the Committee on Trade and Development at its next Meeting.","WTCOMTDM18.pdf","India, Pakistan, Pakistan, Committee, on, Trade, and, Development"
"1217",1217,"48","48.      The representative of Morocco said that his delegation supported the intervention made by the representative of Pakistan. According to its mandate, the Committee on Trade and Development was the appropriate body for discussing special and differential measures in favour of developing countries. The special and differential measures in favour of developing countries constituted the development dimension of international trade and were an integral part of the obligations that WTO Members had committed themselves to in the GATT 47, the GATT 94, and in the WTO Agreements. The Committee should examine the implementation of those provisions and, with the help of the Secretariat, examine what the problems were; first for the developed countries to implement certain provisions, and second for developing countries as regards provisions that had not been used. The Committee should particularly examine the difficulties of non-implementation in order to arrive at the implementation of a large part of the provisions which were of great importance to developing countries. The document was a step towards full application of all special and differential provisions in favour of developing countries. The Item should remain on the agenda of the Committee. It was only in that way that developing countries could be encouraged to participate fully in an equal manner in the international trading system.","WTCOMTDM18.pdf","Morocco, Pakistan, Committee, on, Trade, and, Development, WTO, Members, GATT, GATT, WTO, Committee, Secretariat, Committee, Committee"
"1218",1218,"49","49.     The representative of the United States noted that document WT/COMTD/W/33 needed to be updated in terms of the information provided. However, the data that was available generally showed                                                                            WT/COMTD/M/18                                                                            Page 11 that the provisions with respect to developing countries were on track which was an encouraging sign in terms of the obligations that all Members had taken. His delegation looked forward to discussions regarding specific measures. In terms of obligations by developed countries his delegation was of the view that one measure that should be taken into account in terms of the special treatment developed countries provided to developing countries was the growth in exports of developing countries since the Uruguay Round. Developing countries in general, excluding a number of least-developed countries, had improved their exports and that was related to the commitments in the Uruguay Round. He also noted that part of the progress of the many provisions in favour of developing countries had been that they allowed those countries to modify regimes and implement trade-creating liberalizing policies during the transition periods that were provided. This would benefit developing countries in the longer term. Those particular provisions could always be seen as a double-edged sword, but nonetheless, his delegation was of the opinion that the process was healthy and deserved the sort of review that had been initially suggested by the representative of Pakistan.","WTCOMTDM18.pdf","United, States, Members, Uruguay, Round, Uruguay, Round, Pakistan"

His delegation therefore supported the request made by the representative of Pakistan and other developing countries to update comprehensive information regarding the implementation of all special provisions relating to developing countries in the Uruguay Round Agreements, legal instruments and ministerial decisions. Regarding the provisions which had not yet been operationalized, as they did not provide for action per se, his delegation suggested that they should be further explored by the Committee on Trade and Development at a subsequent meeting and that appropriate action should be taken for full implementation.","WTCOMTDM18.pdf","Myanmar, ASEAN, Pakistan, Uruguay, Committee, on, Trade, and, Development"

The representative of the European Communities said that her delegation was committed to the better integration of the least-developed countries into the world trading system. The High-Level Meeting was not a one-off event but a starting point of a process and her delegation intended to build upon it. However, special efforts directed towards the least-developed countries should not allow Members to neglect all the other developing countries and the specific commitments that had been entered into in that regard, and which had been included in the conclusions of the Uruguay Round. The regular monitoring of the implementation of the special provisions in favour of developing countries was necessary to keep the focus and to put pressure on their implementation. Document WT/COMTD/W/33 showed that the Committee on Trade and Development was on the right track. Her delegation welcomed the announcement by the delegation of Pakistan that it would present an informal paper on ways to operationalize certain provisions. The debate on these matters could be used as an occasion to capture useful hints on what the actual concerns of developing countries were so that delegations could work together in a constructive spirit.","WTCOMTDM18.pdf","Members, Uruguay, Round, Committee, on, Trade, and, Development, Pakistan"

For the purpose of this overview, the General Council would WT/COMTD/M/18 Page 12 need the Committee's Annual Report for 1997. The form that the Report should take was indicated in the General Council's Decision on Reporting Procedures in document WT/L/105. It should be brief, factual in nature and provide an indication of the actions and decisions taken by the Committee during 1997. The Secretariat had prepared a draft Report along those lines, circulated in document WT/COMTD/W/34, which was before the Committee for its consideration and adoption. The current meeting's discussion should, of course, also be reflected in the Report.

At that meeting, delegations had expressed the wish that the subject become a standing item on the agenda of the Committee. The view had also been expressed that the intention of a further discussion on this item in the Committee should not be to revise the document as the purpose of the document had only been to provide elements for delegations to react to.","WTCOMTDM18.pdf","Chairman, Committee, on, Trade, and, Development, Secretariat, Committee, Committee"
"1228",1228,"58","58.      The representative of Egypt said that the issue of the review of participation of developing country members in the multilateral trading system was an issue of importance to developing countries. His delegation was of the view that consideration of this issue could be done in a much more effective way. The terms of reference of the Committee on Trade and Development indicated that the Committee should keep under review the participation of developing country Members in the multilateral trading system and consider measures and initiatives to assist developing country Members, in particular the least-developed country Members, in the expansion of their trade and investment opportunities. He was of the view that the way in which the issue had been dealt with could be strengthened in order to satisfy the terms of reference. He hoped that this would be achieved when considering the item during the coming year as it was too late for the approach to be adopted for the current year. He then turned to the document itself and said that his delegation welcomed a reference to developing countries with successful trade performances. However, this had to be put into its context as had been done in paragraph two which indicated that, in 1996, the trade share of developing countries had, for the first time, risen above its 1985 level. That was the context in which the discussion should take place and it showed that much remained to be done. The trade performance of African and the Middle Eastern countries three years after the entry into force of the WTO Agreements remained disappointing. As was mentioned in paragraph 8, the share of world exports accounted for by developing countries in Africa and in the Middle East had declined over the past decade. Paragraph 8 only indicated that there had been a decline, without further analysing its reasons. His delegation considered it necessary to analyze why the trade share of these developing countries had been declining. The difficulties should       1    The Committee on Trade and Development's Annual Report was subsequently circulated in document WT/COMTD/13.

The kind of assistance required to help those countries enhance their trade performance was to be analyzed as well. A more detailed analysis, on a less aggregated level, should be undertaken with regard to the issue. Whether the analysis should be limited to trade in goods or whether it should also include trade in services was another issue to consider. Consideration of this item should help developing countries address issues relating to their share of world trade and their participation in the multilateral trading system. He proposed that the Secretariat prepare an outline of a study for the Committee to assess and to indicate its desired direction. The inclusion of trade in services was one of the elements his delegation was willing to consider. An analysis of the participation of developing countries in world trade would require something more elaborate than the eight pages provided in document WT/COMTD/W/31. Some conclusion were called for, especially indicating areas where technical assistance was needed.","WTCOMTDM18.pdf","Egypt, Committee, on, Trade, and, Development, Committee, Members, Members, Members, WTO, Africa, Middle, East, Committee, on, Trade, and, Development, Secretariat, Committee"

The representative of Egypt said that the international community was witnessing recent developments of the Internet and the technology associated with it that provided new opportunities for the expansion of trade in both goods and services in developed and developing countries alike. There was no doubt that electronic trade would increase significantly in the years to come. A number of international organizations had started to address issues related to electronic trade in an active manner, like UNCTAD, and UNCITRAL. WTO was in the process of creating a trade database and cooperated with the World Bank in a project related to information technology. Furthermore, the High-Level Meeting for Least-Developed Countries had addressed the issue of the use of Information Technology as a means to enhance exports from LDCs. It would therefore be appropriate to discuss the issue of electronic-trade in goods and services in the Committee on Trade and Development and his delegation intended to present an informal paper to the Committee.

The representative of Morocco was happy to note that Africa's share of the budget for technical cooperation had increased and his delegation hoped that that trend would be maintained in the future as Africa's need for technical assistance was great. He underlined that the previous year his delegation had asked for an evaluation of the Integrated Technical Assistance Programme in Selected Least-Developed and Other African Countries. The Secretariat had responded then that too little time had elapsed since the launching of that programme and that it was therefore premature to carry out an evaluation. The moment had come for the Secretariat to proceed with an evaluation of the Integrated Programme, as UNCTAD and ITC had also been asked to do. The evaluation should be independent. The best way to carry out the evaluation would be through the appointment of an independent external evaluator. Two aspects should be looked at more deeply. First, coordination between the three organizations; had the objectives set by the three organizations been reached? Second, the performance of the instruments used in providing technical assistance should be evaluated. The evaluation should be continuous, allowing for the improvement of the content at the national level. Seminars were useful, but that they should not outweigh other modes of delivery.

However, the costs of those activities had risen to outstrip the resources available in the regular WTO budget. Total estimated expenditure in 1998 would be in the order of SwF4.9 million, whereas the regular budget allocation was only SwF0.74 million. That shortfall was, as the report noted, currently largely made good through extra budgetary resources. His delegation doubted whether a degree of dependence on extra budgetary resources of that magnitude was desirable or sustainable over time. Without prejudging that issue, his delegation saw benefit in enhanced dialogue and enhanced coordination between the Committee on Trade and Development and the Budget Committee so that policy could be developed with full regard to resource implications and so that technical assistance could be smoothly planned. He hoped that future reports along the lines of WT/COMTD/W/36 would provide more information on the financial resources involved.","WTCOMTDm19.pdf","Hong, Kong, China, WTO, Committee, on, Trade, and, Development, and, the, Budget, Committee"

On the Dispute Settlement Understanding, as reflected in sub-section 5 on page 7 of the report, he shared the views expressed by the delegation of India in light of the great involvement of developing countries in the Dispute Settlement Process.

The representative of Turkey said that his delegation considered technical cooperation to be one of the main activities of the WTO for developing countries, for least-developed countries and for countries in accession. Technical cooperation activities had enabled the WTO to function better as it had allowed the more effective participation of all Members in all of its bodies. His delegation noted with satisfaction the increase in technical cooperation activities in 1997 as compared to the previous year, both in number of activities and in subjects covered. Table 3 on page 5 showed new subjects such as accession for which there had been no activity in 1996 and for which there had been 18 activities in 1997. Likewise, no activity with respect to the use of technology for development had been undertaken in 1996, while 7 had been undertaken in 1997. The preparation and follow-up to the High-Level Meeting on Integrated Initiatives for Least-Developed Countries' Trade Development had also -been a new activity in 1997. The Dispute Settlement System was mentioned on page 7, paragraph 5. In view of the enhanced interest in that field, the Secretariat should envisage a supplementary effort by increasing services rendered by professional consultants and by increasing training courses in Geneva as well as national and regional seminars.","WTCOMTDm19.pdf","Turkey, WTO, WTO, Members, Integrated, Initiatives, for, Least-Developed, Countries, ', Trade, Development, Secretariat, Geneva"
"1252",1252,"16","16.      The representative of the United States said that it was significant that technical assistance activities had increased by 85 per cent in 1997. That increase would go a long way toward enhancing the ability of developing countries to become acquainted with the WTO and bring their regimes into conformity with WTO requirements as well as assisting those who were interested in joining the organization. He noted the comment made by the representative of Egypt that the WTO should get away from the seminars format and engage more in hands-on activities. That had also been a goal expressed clearly by a number of delegations during High-Level Meeting on Integrated Initiatives for Least-Developed Countries' Trade Development. Hong Kong, China's point about having an engagement with the Budget Committee made sense as concern had been expressed about the funding                                                                                       WT/COMTD/M/19                                                                                               Page 5 of the programmes. Delegations should consider how the WTO could live within its resources, taking into account the other budgetary challenges faced and to what extent the enhanced technical cooperation would have to continue to be provided by extra budgetary resources. His delegation was interested in and took note of the comments made regarding evaluation of technical assistance.","WTCOMTDm19.pdf","United, States, WTO, WTO, Egypt, WTO, Hong, Kong, China, Budget, Committee, WTO"
"1253",1253,"17","17.      The representative of Uganda found the increased demand for technical assistance a positive sign of developing countries taking advantage of the opportunities that the programme of technical cooperation offered. There was a need for collaboration between the Committee on Trade and Development and the Budget Committee to ensure that the priorities set by the Committee on Trade and Development were respected when the Budget Committee considered the appropriation of funds. Uganda had been one of the beneficiary countries and he welcomed the emphasis that had been put on least-developed countries in general and Africa in particular. As the report showed, emphasis had been put on making the beneficiaries understand the WTO system and conform to its rules. He therefore urged the Committee on Trade and Development to look at how to develop long-term capability. It should not only be the few officials trained in Geneva who understood the system, but they should continue to strengthen the capabilities of their countries. The training of trainers programme was therefore welcome, as participating officials went back to their respective countries to pass on the messages. A link to universities was also desirable as universities should be able to continuously supply skilled officials to operate in the system. It was too optimistic to train a trainer in a one week course and expect him to grasp the whole WTO complex and go back and efficiently train others. Longer term training should be considered so that universities acquired lecturers with good knowledge about the various aspects of international trade law and other issues pertinent to the multilateral trading system. With regard to the High-Level Meeting on Integrated Initiatives for Least-Developed Countries' Trade Development his delegation had emphasized the need to look beyond the Geneva-based organizations in terms of coordination if the Committee was ready to factor supply constraints into the programme that had been designed. His delegation therefore wished to hear about the coordination with the Bretton Woods institutions. He asked whether the policy discussed in the WTO had been incorporated in the policy framework papers of the Bretton Woods institutions and what the follow-up vis-à-vis those institutions had been.","WTCOMTDm19.pdf","Uganda, Committee, on, Trade, and, Development, Budget, Committee, Committee, on, Trade, and, Development, Budget, Committee, Uganda, Africa, WTO, Committee, on, Trade, and, Development, Geneva, WTO, Committee, Bretton, Woods, WTO"
"1254",1254,"18","18.      The representative of Tanzania said that his delegation was of the view that as time went on the emphasis of WTO technical assistance should shift from seminars to more result-oriented programmes. As a result of the programme of training of trainers it might be possible for national bodies to sustain the seminar element on their own rather than it being carried out from WTO headquarters in Geneva. The rough figures on page 16 onwards showed that the level of participation of least-developed countries as beneficiaries of technical assistance programmes apart from the High- Level Meeting on Integrated Initiatives for Least-Developed Countries' Trade Development was unsatisfactory. Out of 44 national seminars conducted in 1997 less than 7 related to least-developed countries, and out of 55 technical assistance missions conducted in 1997, only about 9 related to least- developed countries. Out of 78 listed workshops, conferences, symposia, round tables and training courses only 3 to 4 related to least-developed countries. Those figures made him doubtful as to the general increase in the level of participation. He therefore urged the Secretariat to be more out- reaching to least-developed countries and involve more least-developed countries in its programmes. He did not oppose the general philosophy of technical assistance being demand-driven, but he appreciated that one of the reasons for the weak participation of the least-developed countries was related to the fact that not many of them were represented in Geneva. It was then not too much to ask for the WTO Secretariat to reach out to its non-Geneva-based least-developed country Members and include them in its technical assistance programmes. Less than half of the 29 least-developed countries which were WTO Members participated in technical cooperation activities. Although there had been a general increase in technical assistance, the figures should be analyzed carefully and ways had to be found to ensure that least-developed countries benefitted more from WTO technical assistance.

"1255",1255,"19","19.     The representative of Bangladesh said that it was clear that there was a consensus that technical activities were highly desirable and should continue. The question of sustainability of the programme needed to be considered carefully. The dependence on donations from generous Members had been sustaining the programme for years. He therefore urged that ways be found to include the costs for technical assistance within the regular budget. His delegation had expected to see more tangible results from follow-up activities to the High-Level Meeting on Integrated Initiatives for Least-Developed Countries' Trade Development mentioned in the report. The tables showed a spectacular growth in technical cooperation activities, but it did not give a figure as to the least- developed countries' share. He agreed with the representative of Tanzania who had pointed out that the need rather than the demand sometimes had to be taken into consideration, especially with respect to non-Geneva based least-developed countries. The most needed might not even be aware of the existence of available technical assistance services.","WTCOMTDm19.pdf","Bangladesh, Members, Integrated, Initiatives, for, Least-Developed, Countries, ', Trade, Development, Tanzania"
"1256",1256,"2","2.      The Chairman said that the Secretariat had prepared a report on all technical cooperation and training activities carried out in 1997 (WT/COMTD/W/36). The report followed broadly the same format as that of the previous year with corrigenda 1 and 2 complementing the information on two specific points. It provided a broad overview of the various types of activities undertaken and their regional distribution. The tables annexed to the document provided details on each activity. The report covered activities funded from the regular budget for technical cooperation and training, as well as those financed by the WTO Trust Fund. The vast majority had been funded through extra- budgetary resources.","WTCOMTDm19.pdf","Chairman, Secretariat, WTO, Trust, Fund"
"1257",1257,"20","20.      The representative of Australia noted the large increase in technical assistance activities and the significant additional demands that this placed on the WTO and would continue to place during the coming years, particularly in light of an increasing membership and an increasing number of implementation commitments which would fall due in the medium term. With regard to the general issue of how the organization approached those demands, she said that the point on coordination with the Budget Committee, as raised by the representative of Hong Kong, China, was important. The approach had to be coherent both within the organization and in relation to other organizations in the Integrated Framework for Trade-Related Technical Assistance, including for Human and Institutional Capacity-Building, to Support Least-Developed Countries in Their Trade and Trade-Related Activities. With regard to evaluation she said that with increasing demands it was important that the resources were used in the most effective way. An evaluation could also be useful in highlighting broader issues and constraints in the delivery of technical assistance. Delegations were already aware of some constraints such as human-resource constraints in the Secretariat. Her delegation noted with interest the point made by Egypt about the seminar format versus other kinds of technical assistance.","WTCOMTDm19.pdf","Australia, WTO, Budget, Committee, Hong, Kong, China, Integrated, Framework, for, Trade-Related, Technical, Assistance, Secretariat, Egypt"
"1258",1258,"21","21.     The Chairman said that the Committee seemed to agree that technical assistance in principle should be demand-driven but that the aspect of real need also had to be considered. Some countries had difficulty in formulating their needs as had been noted in connection with the High-Level Meeting on Integrated Initiatives for Least-Developed Countries' Trade Development. Issues relating to evaluation had been raised by many delegations. Questions touched on whether an evaluation should be internal or external and on the criteria to be used. It was high time to consider those aspects in order to see if WTO technical cooperation activities headed in the right direction. He therefore asked the Secretariat to look at those issues. The question of coordination and the need to avoid overlap had also been treated. Optimum use of available resources outside the WTO should be assured. The academia, the private sector and NGOs should be involved. Another issue raised was the large increase in the demand for technical assistance activities and whether that was sustainable given the available budgetary resources. There was a need for the Chair of the Committee on Trade and Development to consult with the Budget Committee on that issue. Whether less emphasis should be put on seminars and more on other technical cooperation activities was another issue discussed.","WTCOMTDm19.pdf","Chairman, Committee, WTO, Secretariat, WTO, Committee, on, Trade, and, Development, Budget, Committee"
"1259",1259,"22","22.      The Secretariat responded to questions asked. With respect to taking into account infrastructural problems in developing countries when carrying out the information for technology project, given the large number of countries that the WTO Secretariat had linked-up to the Internet it was obvious that there were countries with infrastructural problems among those. Twenty-two least- developed countries had so far been linked-up and it was expected that by end of the year 36 least- developed countries would have benefitted from the project. The main infrastructural problem was the weakness of the telephone lines. There was cooperation at the technical level with the International Telecommunications Union (ITU) in launching satellites which would reduce the problems of weak telecommunication networks. Several delegations had made reference to the fact that the resources of the Secretariat for technical cooperation in relation to dispute settlement was                                                                                    WT/COMTD/M/19                                                                                            Page 7 currently being discussed in the Budget Committee. In addition to the external experts available in the Secretariat for developing country Members under Article 27.2 of the Dispute Settlement Understanding, the Secretariat had two staff members available in the Technical Cooperation and Training Division. The Secretariat had taken note of the request to shift from seminars to technical expert missions. The technical cooperation activities were already going in that direction. However, the Secretariat would continue to respond to requests for seminars.","WTCOMTDm19.pdf","Secretariat, WTO, Secretariat, International, Telecommunications, Union, ITU, Secretariat, Budget, Committee, Secretariat, Members, Secretariat, Technical, Cooperation, and, Training, Division, Secretariat, Secretariat"
"1260",1260,"23","23.      The Secretariat continued by saying that the Integrated Technical Cooperation Programme for Africa with ITC and UNCTAD had been subsumed under the Integrated Framework for Trade- Related Technical Assistance, including for Human and Institutional Capacity-Building, to Support Least-Developed Countries in Their Trade and Trade-Related Activities as far as the four least- developed countries included in that Programme were concerned. That was a major contribution to the follow-up to the High-Level Meeting on Integrated Initiatives for Least-Developed Countries' Trade Development. An evaluation of the Africa Programme was required under the Programme itself and had been discussed with donors, the beneficiary countries and the three institutions. An evaluation would be undertaken in due course. The Secretariat had also taken note of the suggestions made to involve research institutions and universities in WTO courses. Courses already had such participation to some extent but there was no defined policy to that effect. It was clear that several least-developed and other developing countries did not have a representation in Geneva. The WTO Secretariat tried to take that into consideration in increasingly cooperating with Secretariats of other Organizations such as the Commonwealth Secretariat, the ACP Secretariat and the Forum Secretariat. As a result of the follow-up to the High-Level Meeting on Integrated Initiatives for Least-Developed Countries' Trade Development, technical cooperation activities benefitting least-developed countries would increase. The first three-week trade policy course for English-speaking least-developed countries was to be held in Geneva in late April, and the first for French-speaking countries in the early autumn. To hold three-week courses was something new to the programme of technical cooperation.","WTCOMTDm19.pdf","Secretariat, Integrated, Technical, Cooperation, Programme, Africa, ITC, UNCTAD, Integrated, Framework, for, Trade, Africa, Programme, Secretariat, WTO, Geneva, WTO, Secretariat, Commonwealth, Secretariat, ACP, Secretariat, Forum, Secretariat, Geneva"
"1261",1261,"24","24.      In response to the proposal to move from seminars to individual technical missions, the Secretariat said that delegations should not be misled by the word seminar. Seminars, such as the seven held on the GATS before the Financial Services negotiations were as good as any technical mission. The difference between seminars and one-to-one technical missions was that when the Secretariat wished to deliver training to a number of countries there was a seminar, while technical missions only benefitted the country in which it was held. In the case of services, a technical mission could have been sent to all participating WTO Members which would have amounted to over a hundred missions; instead the Secretariat had covered all Members and countries in accession with seven seminars. Had delegations meant to refer to general seminars as opposed to specialized seminars or had delegations meant moving away from specialized seminars to technical missions? The reliance on the seminar method was a result of the lack of resources, both personnel and financial. Regarding least-developed countries, the representative of Tanzania had noted that only few technical assistance activities had benefitted least-developed countries. He provided part of the answer himself by referring to the demand-driven approach. However, it might be reassuring that in the course of the implementation of the recommendations of the High-Level Meeting on Integrated Initiatives for Least-Developed Countries' Trade Development, programmes were to be organized for all countries having responded to the needs-assessment request and even to some of the least-developed countries that had not responded to the request. Regional workshops with intensive training would be provided. Moreover, two intensive trade-policy courses were to be organized. Next years report on WTO technical cooperation activities would therefore show a significant increase in technical assistance to least-developed countries. With regard to technical assistance given under Article 27.2 of the Dispute Settlement Understanding, two professionals, apart from the staff members of the Technical Cooperation and Training Division, were mandated to give technical assistance to any delegation requesting it. However, it was important to note that there was a limit to the assistance that the staff or the professional consultants could give. They could not be involved in the process of submitting or WT/COMTD/M/19 Page 8 drafting statements or submissions for the dispute settlement process. That was at least not the way in which the Secretariat had envisaged the assistance to be provided. Rather, developing country Members were helped with advice and material in the preparatory stage. If the Member decided to go ahead with the process, the submissions had to be drafted by the Member itself with the consultant thereafter commenting on them. A modest increase in the available resources for such technical assistance had been envisaged in expectation that the dispute settlement process increasingly would involve developing countries, both as complainants and as defendants.","WTCOMTDm19.pdf","Secretariat, Secretariat, WTO, Members, Secretariat, Members, Tanzania, WTO, Technical, Cooperation, and, Training, Division, Secretariat, Members, Member, Member"

Document WT/COMTD/W/37 had been prepared in view of that request and was a considerably shortened version of the initial Manual.","WTCOMTDm19.pdf","Chairman, Committee, on, Trade, and, Development, Secretariat, Committee"
"1264",1264,"27","27.      The representative of Morocco said that the new document fully reflected what a manual on technical cooperation should be and his delegation wished to see it adopted immediately by the Committee so that it could be published and disseminated to the Members. The Manual would allow Members to make better use of WTO Technical Cooperation activities. It would also allow the WTO to make its policy on technical cooperation more active. His delegation agreed with what had been said by the delegation of Tanzania on least-developed countries. The Manual could contribute to rectify the tendency of only a small share of WTO technical assistance activities benefitting least- developed countries.","WTCOMTDm19.pdf","Morocco, Committee, Members, Members, WTO, WTO, Tanzania, WTO"
"1265",1265,"28","28.     The representative of Norway said that the first paragraph of the Manual referred to 132 WTO Members and 30 countries in the process of accession.

The representative of United States wished to see a small change in the wording of the introduction where it said that more than three quarters of the WTO Members had the status of developing countries.

"1267",1267,"3","3.      The representative of India said that, as mentioned in the report, technical assistance should continue to be demand driven and based on the expertise available in the WTO Secretariat. With regard to the Information Technologies for Development Project, mentioned on page 6 of the report, he asked whether any assessment had been made of the status of the infrastructure relevant to the use of information technology in developing countries. Specifically, how did the planners of this project assess the status of the power and telecommunications sectors of developing countries? Such an assessment was necessary in order to ensure that developing countries could access and use the valuable information available electronically. His delegation appreciated the detail given on page 7 on the demand for technical cooperation in the area of dispute settlement, but asked whether any assessment had been made of the availability and utilization of resources under Article 27.2 of the Dispute Settlement Understanding. The growing number of developing countries involved in the dispute settlement process might create a need to enhance the budgetary allocation for technical cooperation in that area. One way of making such an assessment could be for developing country Members to discuss, in the Committee on Trade and Development, their views on the resources available.","WTCOMTDm19.pdf","India, WTO, Secretariat, Information, Technologies, for, Development, Project, Members, Committee, on, Trade, and, Development"

"1269",1269,"31","31.     The Chairman said that at its last meeting in November, the Committee on Trade and Development had requested the Secretariat to update document WT/COMTD/W/33 in line with suggestions made by delegations and had agreed to revert to the item at today's meeting. The Secretariat had circulated a new document, WT/COMTD/W/35, dated 11 February 1998 which attempted to update and supplement document WT/COMTD/W/33 so as to provide comprehensive information on actions taken pursuant to WTO provisions in favour of developing country Members. In the case of a number of these provisions, the Secretariat had not found it possible to insert                                                                                      WT/COMTD/M/19                                                                                              Page 9 meaningful information on the implementation of the provisions. That was the case most particularly for provisions of a preambular nature and for provisions that called on Members autonomously to take account of the trade interests of developing country Members in the course of implementing the WTO Agreements. The Secretariat had exercised constraint in the amount of detail provided in the document to avoid it becoming a document of unworkable size. Delegations interested in more detailed information were kindly referred to work being undertaken in other parts of the Secretariat. In particular, in the area of agriculture, an informal paper on Special and Differential Treatment Provisions Relating to the Agreement on Agriculture had been circulated on 16 February.","WTCOMTDm19.pdf","Chairman, Committee, on, Trade, and, Development, Secretariat, Secretariat, WTO, Members, Secretariat, Members, Members, WTO, Secretariat, Secretariat"
"1270",1270,"32","32.      The representative of India said that special and differential provisions constituted an integral part of the WTO Agreement and that it was therefore important to assess the status of the implementation of those provisions in the context of the functioning of the WTO in the first three years of the Organization's existence. Any such assessment would be made with the objective of ensuring that the legitimate expectations of developing countries were being met. His delegation realized that it was difficult to make an assessment of the implementation of the preambles of different WTO Agreements. The preambles were nonetheless integral parts of individual agreements which gave the totality of the objective of the Agreement, especially as related the raising of standards of living and meeting the needs of developing countries. Ways should therefore be sought to assess how the objectives of the agreements, as contained in the preambular provisions, were being operationalized.","WTCOMTDm19.pdf","India, WTO, WTO, WTO"
"1271",1271,"33","33.     He continued by saying that a major area of concern was the non-implementation of provisions with regard to the Agreement on Technical Barriers to Trade (TBT), as reflected on pages 17-21. Not a single provision relating to the special and differential treatment contained in Article 12 of the TBT Agreement had been implemented during the first three years of operation of the Agreement. The Committee on Trade and Development, with its specific terms of reference, should therefore ensure that the forward looking programme of implementation of the TBT Agreement was being operationalized. His delegation requested that the issue be treated in the Committee on Trade and Development, perhaps jointly with the Committee on Technical Barriers to Trade. The chairmen of the two Committees might consult on how to operationalize Article 12 of the TBT Agreement.","WTCOMTDm19.pdf","Committee, on, Trade, and, Development, Committee, on, Trade, and, Development, Committee, on, Technical, Barriers, to, Trade"
"1272",1272,"34","34.     Another issue his delegation wished to address was that of the implementation of the General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS), especially the remarks in the implementation column on page 38 of document WT/COMTD/W/35 relating to the preparatory work for the next round of negotiations in services. He requested the Secretariat of the Committee on Trade and Development to coordinate with other parts of the Secretariat to prepare a factual background note on the results of the sectoral negotiations in services in the past three years, namely, financial services, basic telecommunications and movement of natural persons. Such a factual background note should provide the Committee with relevant data for assessing the benefits that developing countries to date had drawn from the operation of the GATS. He also requested the Secretariat to coordinate its efforts to provide the Committee with a factual document indicating sectors of specific export interest for developing countries in the area of trade in services. That request was made with specific reference to page 38 of the document. Such a database should provide developing country Members with important information before participating in the work of the Council for Trade in Services on the negotiating guidelines for the next round.","WTCOMTDm19.pdf","General, Agreement, on, Trade, in, Services, Secretariat, Committee, on, Trade, and, Development, Secretariat, Committee, GATS, Secretariat, Committee, Members, Council, for, Trade, in, Services"
"1273",1273,"35","35.     He went on to comment on the implementation of the Agreement on Textiles and Clothing (ATC), as contained on pages 11-13 of the document. The Council for Trade in Goods had adopted a major review of the implementation of the ATC, in the first three years of its operation, (document G/C/W/105). He requested that that document be included in the database for consideration in the Committee on Trade and Development of the issue of implementation of WTO provisions in favour of developing countries. The Council for Trade in Goods had observed that only WT/COMTD/M/19 Page 10 a small number of products which had been under quota restriction had been integrated into GATT 1994 in the first three years of existence of the ATC. It was obvious from that assessment that the legitimate expectations of developing country Members that the ATC would bring significant trade liberalisation, and consequently benefits to their exporters, had not been met. Special and differential treatment had to be seen as tempering the concept of reciprocity. Together they resulted in the concept of equity and balance which was what the special and differential provisions were supposed to ensure. Unless developing country Members were able to derive the benefits they had legitimately expected from the multilateral trading system, they could not be expected to proceed further along the path of trade liberalisation. Developing countries needed a clear picture of what they had received in return for the commitments and concessions they had made by entering into the different agreements of the WTO.","WTCOMTDm19.pdf","ATC, Council, for, Trade, in, Goods, ATC, Committee, on, Trade, and, Development, WTO, Council, for, Trade, in, Goods, GATT, ATC, Members, ATC, Members, WTO"
"1274",1274,"36","36.     The representative of Egypt considered the new document an improvement over earlier versions. With the new document, it was possible to launch a process of addressing the issue of special and differential provisions in depth. The issue of special and differential provisions was a fundamental cross-cutting issue for developing countries. It reflected how the multilateral trading system accommodated Members at different stages of development and it was an integral part of the balance of rights and obligations in various agreements. The issue of special and differential treatment should be addressed at two levels; the broad conceptual level and a detailed examination of the implementation of various special and differential provisions in the WTO Agreements. Conceptually, as liberalization commitments of developing countries had deepened and the trade agenda broadened it had become imperative to examine if the special and differential provisions had achieved their objectives, and if not, how they could be developed to do so. On the level of particular provisions, it was evident from the report that a number of provisions had not been adequately implemented while others had remained non-operational. It was not time to blame but rather to seriously consider, in the various bodies of the WTO, how best to implement those provisions. The Committee on Trade and Development needed to examine how to link its conceptual discussion to the detailed consideration of various provisions in other bodies. If developing countries felt that the special and differential provisions were being faithfully implemented, it would facilitate their approach to future negotiations. The issue of special and differential provisions should therefore be addressed in a constructive spirit. His delegation was in the process of formulating ideas. He suggested that the Chairman of the Committee on Trade and Development began a process of informal consultations on the issue as soon as possible.","WTCOMTDm19.pdf","Egypt, Members, WTO, WTO, Committee, on, Trade, and, Development, Chairman, Committee"
"1275",1275,"37","37.      The representative of Morocco said that the effort to improve the rules and regulations in favour of developing countries in the WTO Agreements should be maintained. Those rules and regulations constituted an integral part of the rights and obligations of the WTO Agreements. They should therefore be fully implemented just as obligations in other Agreements. The Committee on Trade and Development and the Secretariat should proceed to an analysis of the provisions and their implementation. That should be done in coordination with other implementing WTO bodies so as to contribute to the improvement of the concept of special and differential treatment. Special and differential treatment tried to achieve a balance of rights and obligations among Members at different levels of economic development. It was common knowledge that some provisions were difficult to operationalize whereas others which took the form of declarations were not accompanied by any concrete measures. His delegation supported the proposal made by the representative of Egypt that informal consultations should be carried out to allow a certain number of delegations to express their views clearly as to how they intended to improve the concept in order to reach better implementation of the special and differential provisions.","WTCOMTDm19.pdf","Morocco, WTO, WTO, Committee, on, Trade, and, Development, Secretariat, WTO, Members, Egypt"

The representative of European Communities said that her delegation had been satisfied with the previous version of the document as it pointed to the conclusion that the level of implementation of the special and differential provisions was high, both on the part of developing countries and on the part of developed Members. The deepened analysis in the revised version had confirmed the earlier                                                                                    WT/COMTD/M/19                                                                                           Page 11 conclusion. Various examples of the high level of implementation could be found in the document, even in areas of particular relevance to developing countries. For example, the part on the Agreement on Agriculture began with a positive note concerning tropical agricultural products. Another good example was found under the section on the Agreement on Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures (SPS) where it was mentioned that some equivalence agreements had been concluded. Even in relation to the Agreement on Technical Barriers to Trade which had been mentioned as a not particularly good sector it had been agreed that technical assistance should be provided. Her delegation encouraged developing countries to make full use of the flexibility built into the system with the aim of fully integrating into the world economy. Her delegation was of the opinion that the document was a good one and hoped that the Committee on Trade and Development could take note of the document as it was. It could constitute the agreed basis of reference for future work.","WTCOMTDm19.pdf","Members, SPS, Committee, on, Trade, and, Development"
"1277",1277,"39","39.     The representative of Bangladesh said that special and differential treatment was an important aspect of the multilateral trading system. It was therefore both an obligation and a responsibility of the Secretariat to reflect on achievements with respect to the implementation of special and differential provisions. His delegation understood that it might not always be possible to respond to preambular texts. Some of those special and differential provisions were for Members to implement autonomously in bilateral relations. The WTO was responsible for monitoring the multilateral trading system and should have the capacity and knowledge to brief Members as to the actual state of implementation of special and differential provisions.","WTCOMTDm19.pdf","Bangladesh, Secretariat, Members, WTO, Members"

That should be possible WT/COMTD/M/19 Page 2 given that the number of courses had increased and that they were conducted in the three official WTO languages. The matter should be discussed in the Committee on Trade and Development for a suitable input to be given to the Budget Committee. Referring to section III, his delegation presumed that the activities relating to ""Investment"", as mentioned on page 4, had been undertaken in response to specific requests by developing country members. Such activities should be without prejudice to the work being done in the Working Group on the Relationship between Trade and Investment and the eventual outcome of that Group's work.","WTCOMTDm19.pdf","WTO, WTO, Committee, on, Trade, and, Development, Budget, Committee, III, Working, Group, Trade, and, Investment, Group"

The representative of Japan said he wished the document to be brought the attention of other appropriate bodies of the WTO such as the Trade Policy Review Body and accession working parties where discussions sometimes occurred on whether a country was to be considered a developing country or not.

He underlined the need for developed countries to live up to their promise of providing technical assistance to developing countries to meet the standards, especially since SPS and TBT requirements were being made more stringent in many developed countries. He hoped that it would be possible for developing countries to be assisted as provided for in the special provisions of the above mentioned agreements. His delegation agreed with the statement made by the representative of Bangladesh.","WTCOMTDm19.pdf","Uganda, SPS, TBT, SPS, Bangladesh"
"1281",1281,"42","42.      The representative of United States said that his delegation's reaction to the document was similar to that of the European Communities. The document was a balanced update on the process, not only of the fulfilment of developed country obligations in relation to special and differential provisions but also of the integration of developing countries into the multilateral trading system. The document was helpful in pointing out the deficiencies on both sides. Two previous speakers had touched on the issue of what more work could be done in the area. The representatives of Egypt and India had approached the issue differently. The approach of the representative of Egypt was a more generic one, including an informal discussion on the whole issue of special and differential provisions. The representative of India had made specific proposals. He felt the suggestion by the Indian representative to have the Secretariat carry out work in relation to the next round of negotiations in services would lead to duplication of work and place an additional burden on the Secretariat. The requirements for preparing for the next round of service negotiations had specific elements dealing with developing countries. Those were the requirements that had to be fulfilled in that process. The issue had to be addressed in a substantive way. He found more appropriate the proposal made by the representative of Egypt to discuss informally in the Committee on Trade and Development what the issues might be, taking all of the agreements into account.

Her delegation continued to support efforts to provide technical assistance to developing countries, in particular to least-developed countries, to help them integrate into the multilateral trading. Her delegation took the occasion to raise the issue of notifications of regional trade agreements. The most recent list from the Secretariat which was contained in document WT/COMTD/W/27/Rev.1 suggested that some agreements or changes to them had not been notified. Paragraph 4 of the Enabling Clause required that any contracting party taking action to introduce an arrangement pursuant to the Enabling Clause or subsequently taking action to modify or withdraw the differential and more favourable treatment so provided shall notify the CONTRACTING PARTIES and furnish them with all the information they may deem appropriate relating to such action. Those requirements should be duly implemented in a transparent way by all Members. Her delegation considered the relevant information to include a copy of the agreement, additional annexes describing the preferential treatment granted and basic trade statistics.","WTCOMTDm19.pdf","Canada, Committee, Secretariat, Members"
"1283",1283,"44","44.      The representative of Hong Kong, China said that just as Members could self-select the status of developing country or economy, so they could self-select whether or not to take advantage of individual special and differential treatment provisions in particular agreements. It should therefore not be assumed that a Member that had developing status automatically took advantage of all preferential provisions at its disposal. For example, in the case of Hong Kong, China, very sparing use of such preferential provisions had been made. He could only think of one provision from which advantage had been drawn. However, that had in practical terms been more than offset by the discrimination to which exports from Hong Kong, China had been subject over many years as a result of its developing country status, particularly in relation to trade in textiles and clothing. Members with developing status should not think of that status as a one-way street, nor should it be thought of in terms of a balance sheet of advantages and liabilities under particular agreements. There were more intangible factors which had to be taken into account. While the Secretariat paper was a useful reference document, it by no means told the entire story, especially given the caveats relating to the information which was available or not available with respect to implementation. His delegation was interested in participating in informal consultations.","WTCOMTDm19.pdf","Hong, Kong, China, Members, Member, Hong, Kong, China, Hong, Kong, China, Members, Secretariat"
"1284",1284,"45","45.      The representative of Myanmar, speaking on behalf of ASEAN, said that ASEAN considered special and differential treatment an important principle as it allowed developing countries to contribute to and meaningfully participate in the WTO. Developing countries had increasingly been contributing in assuming greater obligations with respect to various Agreements of the WTO. Additionally, it should be recognized that developing countries were undertaking voluntary autonomous liberalisation. On the other hand, developing countries had been enabled a certain flexibility in relation to particular obligations. The special and differential provisions allowed developing countries to be part of the WTO and his delegation was therefore concerned both about ideas that would erode the special and differential provisions and about deficiencies in the application of special and differential provisions in some of the Agreements. The idea presented by the representative of India could usefully be pursued to further develop and meaningfully operationalize the special and differential provisions.","WTCOMTDm19.pdf","Myanmar, ASEAN, ASEAN, WTO, WTO, WTO, India"
"1285",1285,"46","46.      The representative of Australia particularly welcomed the transparency of the Secretariat paper in setting out the provisions in all of the WTO Agreements and how they had been used. There were some necessary limitations to the paper as it was based on what had been notified. There were areas in which use or reliance on special and differential provisions did not need to be notified. There were also vast areas of technical assistance covered either bilaterally or by international organizations which had been left out of the document. Her delegation had always considered the relationship between rules, standards and protection as being a complicated one. Being a small player, her government had looked to the rules-based system to provide a certain security and to agreements, such as the SPS, to prevent measures from being used for disguised protectionism. Important issues regarding transparency and notifications had been raised. Her delegation would carefully consider the                                                                                      WT/COMTD/M/19                                                                                             Page 13 specific proposals made and hoped that a further discussion would be held on the role of special and differential provisions in assisting developing countries to gain benefits from their participation in the WTO.","WTCOMTDm19.pdf","Australia, Secretariat, WTO, SPS, WTO"

The representative of Pakistan said that his delegation wished to further consider the updated document that his delegation had asked for at the previous meeting of the Committee on Trade and Development. There were certain areas in which the implementation should be looked at closely. He therefore asked that the item be kept on the Committee's agenda. Informal consultations might be helpful. He suggested that specific special and differential provisions of individual Agreements be measured by how far they had reached their fundamental objectives of enabling developing countries to cope with the changed environment following the implementation of those Agreements. That type of analysis could give an insight into how useful the special and differential provisions were and whether they could be strengthened and improved upon in future Agreements to be negotiated. The ultimate purpose of the exercise was to enable developing countries to compete in an equitable manner in a globalizing economic environment.","WTCOMTDm19.pdf","Pakistan, Committee, on, Trade, and, Development, Committee"
"1289",1289,"5","5.       The representative of Egypt said that his delegation had found five positive elements in the report: the increase in the level of technical assistance activities; the increase in extra budgetary resources; the increase in Africa's share in the technical assistance given; the increased coverage of various WTO Agreements and activities; and the increase in activities in relation to the High-Level Meeting on Integrated Initiatives for Least-Developed Countries' Trade Development. Those five elements constituted a positive trend which he hoped would continue. He had a number of specific remarks in relation to the report. First, his delegation doubted that technical assistance was best evaluated by way of number of activities carried out. Some activities were minor while others were major. His delegation looked forward to further improvements in reporting in order to enable delegations to evaluate better the technical assistance provided. Second, his delegation had found that a large percentage of the technical assistance provided had been given through seminars. These were useful to increase initial awareness but the focus should in the future be shifted to practical advice and technical assistance missions in, for example, such areas as assistance in the preparation of notifications, advice in relation to laws and legislation, and advice in respect to the implementation of various WTO Agreements.","WTCOMTDm19.pdf","Egypt, Africa, WTO, WTO"
"1290",1290,"50","50.     The Chairman noted that there were different perceptions of the issues of special and differential provisions. Several delegations had mentioned the importance of technical assistance. Many delegations had seen the need for further work on the matter in the Committee on Trade and Development, pursuant to its mandate. The need for horizontal work between bodies of the WTO Secretariat dealing with specific Agreements had been expressed. It had been suggested that the new Chairman of the Committee on Trade and Development should conduct informal consultations on the most useful orientation the Committee's discussions on the issue. Consensus was emerging in the WTO that implementation would be one of the Agenda items of the Ministerial Meeting in 1998. The work of the Committee on Trade and Development could then provide an additional insight to the discussions that might arise in the General Council.","WTCOMTDm19.pdf","Chairman, Committee, on, Trade, and, Development, WTO, Secretariat, Chairman, Committee, on, Trade, and, Development, Committee, WTO, Committee, on, Trade, and, Development, General, Council"

The Chairman said that, at the Committee's last meeting, the representative of Egypt had raised the issue of electronic commerce in goods and services and requested that it be put on today's Agenda. He had also said that his delegation intended to present an informal paper to the Committee, which had since been circulated in document WT/COMTD/W/38. In addition to an analysis of the various issues involved, the paper contained a number of specific proposals for future activities for consideration by the Committee on Trade and Development and requested a number of papers and activities of the Secretariat. In that context he recalled that the Economic Research and Analysis Division of the WTO Secretariat was preparing a special study on electronic commerce which it hoped to publish in April.","WTCOMTDm19.pdf","Chairman, Committee, Egypt, Committee, Committee, on, Trade, and, Development, Secretariat, Economic, Research, and, Analysis, Division, WTO, Secretariat"
"1293",1293,"53","53.     The representative of Egypt said that his delegation might make minor changes to the paper in light of comments made during the meeting. The current discussion should only be seen as the WT/COMTD/M/19 Page 14 initiation of a process. Delegations would therefore have time to study the issue more in detail in the future. The potential of electronic commerce had captured the attention of governments, businesses and consumers alike. The developments in the area would have a substantial impact on growth and development. They would also have fundamental implications on the way in which business transactions and trade were carried out. His delegation had identified four objectives for addressing the issue:         (i)     to deepen the understanding of electronic commerce and deal with it in a coherent and                 balanced manner, focusing on the use of electronic commerce in integrating                 developing countries into the Multilateral Trading System (MTS);         (ii)    to examine the role of the WTO in bridging the information gap in the area of trade                 between developed and developing countries;         (iii)   to examine how electronic commerce and recent proposals on a possible global                 framework for electronic commerce would affect the supply and demand of goods                 and services, the market structure, labour markets and competition,         (iv)    to share experience on issues related to electronic commerce.","WTCOMTDm19.pdf","Egypt, WTO"
"1294",1294,"54","54.      It was the conviction of his delegation that information technology in general and electronic commerce in particular could be instrumental in enhancing the participation of developing countries in the MTS if the right approach was followed. There was a real fear that if the necessary steps were not taken that mode of trade might remain beyond the reach of many developing countries. The current trade of developing countries, particularly products that might be transmitted digitally, could be diverted if they did not participate actively in electronic commerce as early as possible in the process. Furthermore, the current gap between developed and developing countries might widen as a result of rapid change if concerted action is not taken. The need to narrow the gap between the north and the south had been recognized by all. Narrowing that gap was both important and urgent and would be beneficial to both developed and developing countries alike.","WTCOMTDm19.pdf","MTS"
"1295",1295,"55","55.      He continued by stating that the paper addressed briefly the technological developments and liberalization efforts that were related to electronic commerce and the challenges facing developing countries and African countries in particular in terms of their weakness in telecommunication and information infrastructure as well as elements of the financial requirements in the area. It also addressed the development and impact of the Internet as a global tool for collecting, disseminating and exchanging information. Electronic commerce would extend the scope of what might be considered tradable. Any good or service that might be provided in digital form could probably be traded electronically within and across borders. There was a need to identify areas and sectors where electronic commerce was expected to gain importance. It would also be of vital importance to strengthen the capacity of developing countries to participate in electronic trade in these and in other sectors especially since the impact of electronic commerce might be significant and relatively fast. The paper gave an indication of the kind of difficulties that firms in developing countries were facing and it referred to some of the difficulties encountered by firms in developed countries in dealing with electronic commerce.","WTCOMTDm19.pdf",""
"1296",1296,"56","56.     He went on to say that one of the challenges that developing countries in particular faced in relation to electronic commerce was how to create a conducive policy environment that would maximize the benefits of electronic commerce without compromising legitimate public policy objectives. Enhancing developing countries' interest for and participation in electronic commerce would require concerted efforts, at the policy, the analytical and the technical level. It would be necessary to establish a conceptual and policy platform reflecting the interests and specificities of developing countries in a global framework for electronic commerce. A number of developed                                                                                    WT/COMTD/M/19                                                                                           Page 15 countries had recently completed policy papers on how to establish a global framework for electronic commerce. These papers contained very little about the role of developing countries in designing, establishing and implementing such a framework. Those major trading partners had a global responsibility and should consider the role that they should play to enable developing countries to benefit from this important area and help enhance their participation in international trade in goods and services including through electronic commerce. Developing countries would require assistance to help them put their information on the Internet. It was important to gain knowledge about how much of the trade related information on the Internet originated from developing countries. That issue should be monitored continuously and could be considered as one of the factors that could contribute to the evaluation of the progress of enhancing the role of developing countries in electronic commerce. Developing countries would also require assistance in establishing the regulatory framework that would be conducive to the development of the information society and in raising awareness in the public and the private sectors of the significance of electronic commerce. International cooperation would be necessary in facilitating access to information and to the global information infrastructure, in promoting the transfer of information technology, in the participation of developing countries in research and development activities and related areas as well as in measures to foster dialogue and partnerships between developing and developed countries, both governmental and private, in the area of electronic commerce.","WTCOMTDm19.pdf",""
"1297",1297,"57","57.      He said that the paper enumerated a number of policy areas related to electronic commerce which were usually classified into three broad groups: financial, legal and access issues. However, a discussion should not concentrate unduly on a very detailed consideration of issues that might appear central today but which were likely to disappear or become replaced by others in a constantly evolving environment. Some of the policy issues did not fall within the purview of the WTO and others were addressed by a number of international organizations. His delegation felt that it would be useful for WTO Members to become aware of the latest developments in policy areas and address the role of the WTO, if any, in areas where it might make a useful contribution.","WTCOMTDm19.pdf","WTO, WTO, Members, WTO"
"1298",1298,"58","58.     The paper briefly addressed a few related activities in the WTO and in other international organizations. His delegation wished to stress three points:         -       as far as the WTO was concerned, stronger organic links should be established among                 the areas of WTO competence which were of immediate relevance to discussions on                 electronic commerce;         -       the necessity for cooperation among international organizations dealing with issues                 related to electronic commerce which was a direct result of its inter-sectoral nature;         -       how to integrate information technology in ongoing trade-related activities and                 programmes.","WTCOMTDm19.pdf","WTO, WTO, WTO"
"1299",1299,"59","59.     In conclusion, a number of specific proposals were made in the paper, these were:         -       to request the WTO Secretariat to prepare a factual paper on WTO provisions and                 activities that were most relevant to electronic commerce;         -       to request the WTO Secretariat to prepare an analytical paper on how to enhance the                 participation of developing countries in electronic commerce and the use of                 information technology in the integration of developing countries in the MTS. That                 issue was related to the infrastructural problems of developing countries; WT/COMTD/M/19 Page 16         -       to request the WTO Secretariat to communicate with relevant international                 organizations to provide the CTD with information on their activities in areas closely                 related to electronic commerce;         -       to convene a special session of the CTD to address the issue of electronic commerce;         -       to request the WTO Secretariat to organize a joint seminar with UNCTAD and ITC to                 allow for a better understanding of the issues involved in electronic commerce                 focusing on their development implications.","WTCOMTDm19.pdf","WTO, Secretariat, WTO, WTO, Secretariat, WTO, Secretariat, CTD, CTD, WTO, Secretariat, UNCTAD, ITC"

Third, his delegation found the Briefing Sessions referred to under subsection 6 on page 7 useful and believed that with little effort from the Secretariat they could be extended to benefit more developing country delegations. Briefing sessions should be extended to cover more WTO Agreements and should be held for developing country missions, newcomers to the WTO and for junior WTO staff members. Fourth, with respect to information technology his delegation proposed that a training session for Geneva-based diplomats be organized to familiarize them with information technology activities of the WTO and how those could be used effectively by developing countries. Sub-section 9 on page 8 of the report dealt with technical information provided by the WTO Secretariat. His delegation was not aware of the details of that kind of activity and would therefore appreciate it if the Secretariat could prepare a factual paper on that kind of assistance. Such a paper should make capitals aware of the service and utilize it more effectively. Finally, his delegation had always believed that the Integrated Technical Assistance Programme for Africa should be evaluated more carefully. He asked if an evaluation paper could be prepared by the Secretariat and if such a paper would be linked to the report currently being prepared by the Secretariat for the Ministerial Conference. He further asked what the relation was between activities undertaken as a result of the High-Level Meeting on Integrated Initiatives for Least-Developed Countries' Trade Development and activities of the Integrated Technical Assistance Programme for Africa.","WTCOMTDm19.pdf","Secretariat, WTO, WTO, WTO, WTO, WTO, Secretariat, Secretariat, Integrated, Technical, Assistance, Programme, Africa, Secretariat, Secretariat, Integrated, Technical, Assistance, Programme, Africa"

If electronic commerce were to become of significant importance, as his delegation expected, it had to be ensured that the infrastructure in developing countries, both human and physical, was capable of supporting its development. His delegation approached the issue with an open mind and in a flexible manner and looked forward to constructive discussions on that important issue. Finally, he requested that the proposals he had made should be put forward in informal consultations to be held by the next chairman. His delegation did not push for hasty results but wished to see the issue move forward.","WTCOMTDm19.pdf","chairman"
"1302",1302,"61","61.      The representative of United States said her delegation was impressed by the thoroughness, thoughtfulness and studied approach of the paper. It was a valuable contribution to the emerging discussion on electronic commerce. She hoped that all delegations also studied the proposal put forward by Ambassador Hayes to the General Council on 19 February. The core conclusion of the paper presented by the delegation of Egypt was the vital need for infrastructural development in developing countries and the dilemma as to where financing would come from. Her delegation's answer was that such infrastructure needs should be met by private sector investments, domestic and foreign. It had been her delegation's experience that investment was attracted to hospitable environments where competition led to growth and government rules were minimal. A special fund had been created in order to finance the linking of all schools in the United States, a task that had been 80 per cent completed. Developing countries could do the same. Egypt's paper noted that few funds would be available from international financial institutions. With the changes underway in international telephone accounting rates the revenues of traditional telephone monopolies were sure to decline in the coming years. The best source of future investment would therefore be the private sector. Developing countries themselves would decide whether or not they would be connected electronically and benefit from electronic commerce. Some countries in the developing world had already began a process and were doing well. Her delegation would encourage Egypt and other developing countries that had not yet done so to join the Information Technology Agreement and to make commitments on basic telecommunications. It was also important to support the proposal for a duty-free environment for electronic transmissions. Those gestures would go a long way to ensure private sector investment in response to the openness of the regimes. Egypt and other developing countries should join in the call for the private sector to lead in fostering the growth of electronic commerce through self-regulatory codes of practice.","WTCOMTDm19.pdf","United, States, Ambassador, Hayes, General, Council, Egypt, United, States, Egypt, Egypt, Information, Technology, Agreement, Egypt"
"1303",1303,"62","62.     Her delegation generally supported the idea of increased exchange of information. That would be demonstrated during the WTO Trade Facilitation Seminar in which companies from the United States and other countries would participate. Increased information should also result from the study on Electronic Commerce that the WTO's Research Division would issue by mid-March. Before asking the Secretariat to undertake additional work, her delegation believed that it made sense to ask the Chairman of the General Council to undertake informal consultations on electronic commerce in the near future. Her delegation also welcomed informal discussions on developing country concerns. She wished to point out that there was a distinction between the proposal of the United States for duty- free electronic transmissions and what her delegation believed that the delegation of Egypt was addressing. The discussion initiated by the delegation of Egypt should continue as it was important to cover all issues. The proposal of the United States before the General Council was a first step that                                                                                    WT/COMTD/M/19                                                                                           Page 17 would help facilitate that discussion. There was no need to mesh the two proposals. The General Council was the appropriate body to continue the discussions on her delegation's proposal.","WTCOMTDm19.pdf","WTO, United, States, Electronic, Commerce, WTO, Research, Division, Secretariat, Chairman, General, Council, United, States, Egypt, Egypt, United, States, General, Council, General, Council"
"1304",1304,"63","63.     The representative of India said that his delegation recognized the positive effects electronic commerce could have on growth. As was pointed out in the paper prepared by the delegation of Egypt, the potential of electronic commerce had captured the attention of governments, businesses and consumers alike. The developments in the area would have a substantial impact on growth and development and fundamental implications on the way in which business transactions and trade were carried out. The detail of the paper showed that electronic commerce was a complex issue. There was no accepted definition of what electronic commerce covered. There were aspects of electronic commerce that touched on existing WTO provisions and other aspects which would require further study, especially regarding benefits for developing countries. Issues that had to be examined included; the treatment of intellectual property protection, the movement of natural persons in the form of service providers involved in electronic trade, regulatory regimes, and the administration of border taxes and controls. His delegation therefore supported the proposal made by the delegation of Egypt to have a joint seminar organised with UNCTAD for the impact of electronic commerce on developing countries to be appropriately assessed. UNCTAD could be requested to invite relevant intergovernmental organizations to such a seminar. His delegation looked forward to the paper on electronic commerce prepared by the Research Division of the WTO Secretariat and hoped that that paper would address the specific issues raised in the working paper submitted by the delegation of Egypt. His delegation was willing to participate in informal consultations on the matter.","WTCOMTDm19.pdf","India, Egypt, WTO, Egypt, UNCTAD, UNCTAD, WTO, Secretariat, Egypt"
"1305",1305,"64","64.      The representative of European Communities said that given the fact that electronic commerce covered international trade, the WTO should play a significant role in providing a global predictable framework for its development. Aspects of electronic commerce were relevant under a number of Agreements in the WTO; GATS, the Agreement on Basic Telecommunications, the Agreement on Government Procurement, the Agreement on TRIPS as well as the ITA, including the work currently undertaken under the ITA II. She also recalled the initiative by the Government of the United States on avoiding import duties on electronic transmissions. Her delegation welcomed the initiative to address issues of electronic commerce in the WTO. The initiative was useful in launching the discussion on one of the many issues at stake. Further discussions over the next months were necessary to address other trade-related aspects such as intellectual property rights, government procurement, trade facilitation and to provide a general framework for the development of electronic commerce. It was the view of her delegation that the GATS would have to play a major role in further discussions since electronic transmissions had to be characterized as services. The debate was at an early stage. Many trading partners were only starting to address electronic commerce as a trade issue. The understanding of the issue had to be deepened. It was therefore a positive development that the Committee on Trade and Development at the initial stage also focused on electronic commerce. Not being a technical Committee, Members would benefit from exchanging experiences, listening to each other, discussing overall objectives, concerns and opportunities from the particular perspective of developing countries. However, it would be too early to elaborate a programme of work for the Committee on Trade and Development. The WTO had to put together all elements relevant to the new area of electronic commerce and identify one forum where energy and resources could be concentrated. Until then it was good to explore all aspects of electronic commerce in the Committee on Trade and Development but it was too early to adopt an agenda. The ambition as to joint action should currently be limited as it was still unclear what type of action the WTO as a whole should take with respect to electronic commerce.","WTCOMTDm19.pdf","European, Communities, WTO, WTO, ITA, United, States, WTO, Committee, on, Trade, and, Development, Committee, Members, Committee, on, Trade, and, Development, WTO, Committee, on, Trade, and, Development, WTO"
"1306",1306,"65","65.     The representative of Pakistan believed that it was useful for Members to exchange views on developments in the area of electronic commerce. Those developments appeared to take place at rapid pace, not only in the area of technological development but also in the area of regulation. The momentum had been advanced by countries that had advantages in information technology and which were already witnessing growth in the area of electronic commerce. In July 1997, the United States WT/COMTD/M/19 Page 18 Government had made an announcement on a framework for global electronic commerce which was followed by a ministerial declaration of the European Communities on global information networks. In addition to those framework proposals, many aspects of electronic commerce were being addressed in a number of fora: taxation matters in the OECD, electronic payment systems in the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, uniform commercial code in the International Chamber of Commerce, some aspects of intellectual property protection in WIPO, domain names in ITU, privacy and security matters in the OECD and APEC, access to infrastructure, telecommunication and issues of inter-operability in ITU, OECD and WTO, and technical standards in OECD, ISO and ITU. It seemed obvious that work in all those fora needed to be monitored. Another aspect that required examination was the issue of implications for developing countries: would unrestricted, unregulated electronic commerce provide increased market access to enterprises in developing countries; how would developing country enterprises be fairing, especially with regard to their competitive ability in areas where electronic commerce was carried out; what would the infrastructural implications be; what would be the effect on other modes of supply such as commercial presence and the movement of natural persons; what impact could electronic commerce have on customs revenue. The importance of analysing and monitoring developments was obvious. UNCTAD was doing some work in the area as was the WTO Research Division. Once such papers had been studied, delegations might be in a better position to assess implications and decide on how to proceed with work on the issue.","WTCOMTDm19.pdf","Pakistan, Members, United, States, OECD, Basel, Committee, on, Banking, Supervision, International, Chamber, of, Commerce, WIPO, ITU, OECD, APEC, ITU, OECD, WTO, OECD, ISO, ITU, UNCTAD, WTO, Research, Division"
"1307",1307,"66","66.     The representative of Australia welcomed the focus on the issue of electronic commerce and the recognition of its importance. She noted that the sentiment of the importance of the issue was shared in the WTO: a Secretariat paper was forthcoming and a proposal had been made by the delegation of the United States.","WTCOMTDm19.pdf","Australia, WTO, Secretariat, United, States"
"1308",1308,"67","67.      The representative of New Zealand said that the Egyptian paper was useful and timely in that it set out some of the specific development issues involved in electronic commerce: the weaknesses in telecommunication infrastructure in developing countries and the problems in achieving broad-based access for users. The WTO had a role to play in enhancing international cooperation in the area of electronic commerce and the guiding principles should be coherence, transparency, coordination and avoiding duplication. He noted that the specific aspects of electronic commerce already had been considered by various WTO groups, most recently by the General Council. That raised the question of whether the Committee on Trade and Development should be taking the lead on some of the more general issues identified in the paper presented by the Egyptian delegation. Before progressing much further, his delegation believed that it would be useful to identify work that had been done to date and to establish a coordinated approach for future WTO activity. That appeared to be the aim of the first specific proposal in Egypt's paper, a proposal which his delegation supported. It would also be useful to provide WTO Members with more information on the activities of other international organizations as illustrated by the delegation of Pakistan. After having considered the forthcoming paper of the Secretariat, the Committee on Trade and Development would be better placed to consider the second, fourth and fifth proposal of Egypt's paper, relating specifically to the needs of developing countries such as a special session of the Committee on Trade and Development and a seminar with UNCTAD and ITC. His delegation agreed with the delegation of the European Communities in that it would be premature to begin a programme of work without due consideration of the Secretariat's paper. The WTO as a whole should look further into the issue before arranging joint seminars with other organizations. The proposal made by the delegation of the United States at the General Council was interesting and practical. The use of electronic commerce raised important international trade policy and trade facilitation considerations and could offer significant benefits to a wide range of countries. His delegation therefore looked forward to participating actively in future discussions in the General Council on that proposal.","WTCOMTDm19.pdf","New, Zealand, WTO, WTO, General, Council, Committee, on, Trade, and, Development, WTO, Egypt, WTO, Members, Pakistan, Secretariat, Committee, on, Trade, and, Development, Egypt, Committee, on, Trade, and, Development, UNCTAD, ITC, Secretariat, WTO, United, States, General, Council, General, Council"
"1309",1309,"68","68.     The representative of Myanmar, speaking on behalf of ASEAN, said that, at the meeting of the General Council of 19 February 1998, ASEAN had indicated the interest of its member delegations to broaden the understanding of electronic commerce, in particular its economic, trade and                                                                                    WT/COMTD/M/19                                                                                           Page 19 social implications. The Egyptian paper provided useful ideas in terms of its objectives and outlined specific proposals for future activities. His delegation saw merit in further looking into those aspects in the WTO. The proposals were relevant and would contribute to meeting the objectives of enhancing the understanding of electronic commerce. There was a particular need to tap the expertise of other international organizations, such as UNCTAD.","WTCOMTDm19.pdf","Myanmar, ASEAN, General, Council, ASEAN, WTO, UNCTAD"
"1310",1310,"69","69.     The representative of Canada appreciated the effort of the Egyptian delegation in putting forward the interests of developing countries with regard to electronic commerce and agreed on the importance of looking at how electronic commerce could contribute to trade growth and development. There was ongoing work in a number of fora that might partly achieve some of the suggestions in the paper presented by the Egyptian delegation. The WTO paper was one such example. The first step in any new work by the WTO Secretariat would be an inventory of existing work undertaken: by the Development Bureau of the ITU, especially in the context of the World Telecommunications Development Conference that would take place in Malta at the end of March; by the UNCTAD trade point programme which was part of the trade efficiency initiative launched by UNCTAD VIII; by the UNCTAD partners for the development programme launched in October 1997 that had as one of its two main themes a global electronic trade partnership; by UNCTAD IX, Midrand, which recommended that UNCTAD should follow up the results of the UN international symposium of trade efficiency and, in close cooperation with ITU, assess the practical trade and development implications of the emerging global information infrastructure and identify relevant avenues for action in this area; and finally by the Global Knowledge 1997, held in Toronto sponsored by the Government of Canada and the World Bank. An inventory should lay the ground for any further work.","WTCOMTDm19.pdf","Canada, WTO, WTO, Secretariat, Development, Bureau, ITU, World, Telecommunications, Development, Conference, Malta, UNCTAD, UNCTAD, UNCTAD, UNCTAD, Midrand, UNCTAD, UN, ITU, Toronto, Government, of, Canada, World, Bank"
"1311",1311,"7","7.       The representative of the European Communities said that technical assistance was an area in which it was important to avoid overlap with other organizations. Her delegation welcomed the great increase in technical assistance activities and said that technical assistance should remain demand- driven. Ear-marking a fund for activities benefitting the least-developed countries should not be considered contradictory to the principle of demand-driven technical assistance. Her delegation was of the understanding that it had been agreed that the Integrated Programme for Africa be subsumed into the Integrated Framework for Trade-Related Technical Assistance, including for Human and Institutional Capacity-Building, to Support Least-Developed Countries in Their Trade and Trade- Related Activities but did not find any reference to that effect in the report. The Committee on Trade and Development should work towards developing ways to monitor and evaluate technical assistance activities.

"1312",1312,"70","70.      The representative of Japan said that electronic commerce would contribute to the efficiency of economic activities and had the potential to promote a balanced development of the global economy. While electronic commerce was promoted primarily by private sector initiatives, it was necessary to coordinate and develop the appropriate environment and establish new global rules. His delegation welcomed discussions on electronic commerce in the framework of the WTO. The Government of Japan encouraged ongoing tests by the private sector with respect to electronic commerce. His Government was prepared to make the results of those tests available to carry forward the international discussions on electronic commerce in the WTO. There were currently no customs duties on electronic commerce in Japan and it was desirable for other Members to keep a similar practice to promote electronic commerce. Concrete discussions on customs duties had to be held considering the deliberations in other international fora. As the proposal in the WTO was expected to lead to a legally binding agreement with multilateral disciplines it was important for the discussion and examination to clarify definitions legally.","WTCOMTDm19.pdf","Japan, WTO, Japan, WTO, Japan, Members, WTO"
"1313",1313,"71","71.      The representative of Korea said that the implications of electronic commerce on the multilateral trading system were overarching. Issues such as market access, intellectual property rights, customs valuation and Article XX exceptions had to be considered. It was therefore premature to decide where and how to proceed with the discussion on electronic commerce. He supported the suggestion to await the Secretariat paper and was willing to participate in any informal discussion.","WTCOMTDm19.pdf","Korea, Secretariat"
"1314",1314,"72","72.     The representative of Hong Kong, China said that her delegation would appreciate an in- depth discussion in relation to the implications of electronic commerce on developing economies.

She looked forward to any relevant discussion on the topic and said that her delegation would be willing to participate actively.","WTCOMTDm19.pdf","Hong, Kong, China, WTO"
"1315",1315,"73","73.     The representative of Peru said that the current discussion was opportune since it corresponded to the ever greater interest in having analytical studies and exchange of information to better understand the implications of electronic commerce from the point of view of modalities of trade as well as legal coverage. His delegation supported the proposal made by the delegation of WT/COMTD/M/19 Page 20 Egypt to ask the WTO to draw up a factual document including all aspects of the WTO which might be of interest for electronic trade, among others the GATS, intellectual property and customs valuation. The issue of electronic commerce should be kept on the agenda of the Committee on Trade and Development as it would allow Members to deal with the issue from the development perspective.

"1316",1316,"74","74.     The representative of Norway said that the Egyptian paper was timely, particularly since his government had different ministries focusing on the issue. Electronic commerce was not the future, it was currently taking place and at a rapidly increasing pace. At the same time, the legal framework relating to electronic commerce was unclear. There was need for increased understanding and possibly for some definitions. The need to maintain momentum should therefore not be underestimated. His delegation wished to take part in any future consultations.","WTCOMTDm19.pdf","Norway"
"1317",1317,"75","75.     The representative of Mexico proposed three steps in the treatment of the issue of electronic commerce. First, the paper prepared by the WTO Secretariat should be considered. Second, once that document was available, a meeting in the Committee on Trade and Development should be organized to analyze the paper. That proposal should be seen in conjunction with the proposal by the delegation of Egypt. The WTO could also prepare a factual document on where work was being carried out on electronic commerce. It was common knowledge that UNCTAD, OECD and APEC had carried out work in that respect but it was important not to forget the role played by the private sector. Third, a guideline for the WTO ministerial meeting could be prepared for ministers to be able to determine a way to channel the analysis of the issue. Trade facilitation had three clear faces: first an exploration at the global level, second, the organization at the regional, multilateral and bilateral level, and third, private initiatives. The discussion of electronic commerce could focus on and have those same perspectives. The WTO had to face fully the question of electronic commerce and create the necessary multilateral rules.","WTCOMTDm19.pdf","Mexico, WTO, Secretariat, Committee, on, Trade, and, Development, Egypt, WTO, UNCTAD, OECD, APEC, WTO, WTO"
"1318",1318,"76","76.      The representative of Egypt said that his delegation was conscious of the benefits that electronic commerce might provide for developing countries. The issue of participation of the private sector had been mentioned and was crucial. Electronic commerce was already taking place among the actors of the private sector. That had to be balanced with an examination of what governments ought to do in the area. The objective was not to restrict electronic commerce but to find a conducive environment that would allow electronic commerce to grow in a balanced way and contribute to development. It had been mentioned that the proposal of the delegation of the United States be treated separately. However, remarks by several delegations indicated that it would be preferable to address the issue in a coherent manner in a single forum. His delegation was flexible in that regard. His delegation was interested in addressing the issue from a development perspective. A deepened understanding was necessary. The role played by UNCTAD, WIPO, ITC and other organizations was important and would continue to be so. There was also an important role for the WTO to play. In relation to the specific proposals mentioned in the paper presented by his delegation he said that his delegation did not believe that those had to be implemented at the same time. He recognized that it would require time and looked forward to their implementation in a phased manner. It had not been the intention to duplicate work being done elsewhere. His delegation was willing to wait for the study prepared by the Secretariat to see how it could contribute to the debate. An inventory of work had been mentioned and that was in fact what his delegation had meant by the WTO Secretariat communicating with other organizations to find out what happened in other fora. It was important for the item to remain on the agenda until delegations had had time to discuss the issue and study it in capitals. If it was felt appropriate and useful, the next Chairman could initiate informal consultations after the issuance of the Secretariat paper on electronic commerce.","WTCOMTDm19.pdf","Egypt, United, States, UNCTAD, WIPO, ITC, WTO, Secretariat, WTO, Secretariat, Chairman, Secretariat"
"1319",1319,"77","77.      The Chairman said that the exchange of views had been useful. All delegations seemed interested in understanding the issue of electronic commerce. He encouraged other delegations to circulate non-papers on the issue to enable the Committee on Trade and Development to deepen its                                                                                    WT/COMTD/M/19                                                                                           Page 21 understanding. He took note of the proposal in the paper prepared by the Egyptian delegation that the Committee on Trade and Development request the Secretariat to do a number of things, including the preparation of papers. Given that the Economic Research and Analysis Division of the WTO Secretariat was currently finalising a special study on the topic of electronic commerce, which it hoped to publish by mid-April, he suggested that the Committee await the circulation of that study, which, he had been told by the Secretariat, would cover many of the elements requested by the Egyptian paper. He had also been led to believe that there was a special section in that paper covering development and social issues. It would be relevant to wait for that paper before asking the Secretariat to do any further work.","WTCOMTDm19.pdf","Chairman, Committee, on, Trade, and, Development, Committee, on, Trade, and, Development, Secretariat, Economic, Research, and, Analysis, Division, WTO, Secretariat, Committee, Secretariat, Secretariat"

The Chairman said that the Rules of Procedures of the Committee on Trade and Development stipulated that it should elect a Chairperson from among the representatives of Members. The election should take place at the first meeting of the year and should take effect at the end of the meeting. The Chairperson should hold office until the end of the first meeting of the following year. In that context, he recalled that the General Council at its meeting on 19 February noted the consensus on the nomination of Ambassador Chowdhury of Bangladesh as the next Chairman of the Committee on Trade and Development.","WTCOMTDm19.pdf","Chairman, Committee, on, Trade, and, Development, Chairperson, Members, Chairperson, General, Council, Ambassador, Chowdhury, Bangladesh, Chairman, Committee, on, Trade, and, Development"
"1322",1322,"8","8.       The representative of Norway said that the quantity of technical assistance activities carried out was impressive as was the increase in activities in 1997 compared to the previous year. His delegation supported all five positive points mentioned by the Egyptian delegation. However, it was concerned that only one fourth of the activities had been financed through the regular budget. In an ideal world it should have been the other way around. Money did not seem to be the problem; the real strain was the capacity of Secretariat to provide technical assistance. His delegation therefore appealed to the Secretariat to be flexible and creative in using all expertise available, including, to a larger extent than currently was the practice, expertise from outside the Secretariat. Norway would be flexible in supporting meaningful activities in that respect. He questioned whether the increased quantity of technical assistance meant that a sufficient quality was maintained. It was necessary to evaluate the technical assistance given and to discuss criteria for such an evaluation. Technical assistance activities should be demand-driven and correspond to the needs of the beneficiaries; it should not be undertaken simply in order to reach a substantive number of activities.","WTCOMTDm19.pdf","Norway, Secretariat, Secretariat, Secretariat, Norway"

The report would contain a detailed description of the work that took place in favour of the least-developed countries both at the High- Level Meeting in October of the previous year and also since then. He would indicate the main items in the Director General's report and give brief information about what these would contain.

"1327",1327,"84","84.    Six points were worth mentioning. The first concerned the approval of the Integrated Framework by the other five agencies. As delegations might recollect, the Integrated Framework had been endorsed at the High-Level Meeting. Since then, the Secretariat had been informed that the Executive Board of the UNDP had endorsed the Integrated Framework at its session held from 19- 26 January 1998. UNCTAD's Trade and Development Board had endorsed the Integrated Framework WT/COMTD/M/19 Page 22 at its session on 16 February 1998. For ITC, which was a joint subsidiary organ of UNCTAD and WTO, the issue would be taken up for discussion at the thirty-first session of the Joint Advisory Group of the ITC foreseen for 27 April - 1 May. The Secretariat had also been informed that the World Bank and the IMF staff had informed their Executive Boards of their intention to participate as regards trade-related technical assistance.","WTCOMTDm19.pdf","Integrated, Framework, Integrated, Framework, Secretariat, Executive, Board, UNDP, Integrated, Framework, UNCTAD, Trade, and, Development, Board, ITC, UNCTAD, WTO, Joint, Advisory, Group, ITC, Secretariat, World, Bank, IMF"
"1328",1328,"85","85.      The second point concerned the number of least-developed countries participating in the exercise. Of the 48 least-developed countries, 37 had so far expressed an interest in participating in the exercise by submitting completed needs assessments. The six agencies had already prepared responses for 34 of the 37 needs assessments received. There were three outstanding which had been received only very recently. The agencies were in the process of drafting responses for those three and would do so for any others that came in. The agencies would be meeting again at the beginning of June. That meeting would provide and opportunity for the six agencies to complete the first stage of the exercise of providing coordinated integrated programmes of technical assistance for the least- developed countries. Stage two of the Integrated Framework, as foreseen in the document that was adopted in October 1997, required essentially two things to be done. The first and most important was that the least-developed countries themselves, those who had received an Integrated Response from the six agencies, were expected to convene a round-table. It was generally expected that round- tables would be held in the context of the UNDP Roundtable cycle or World Bank Consultative Group meetings. So far seven least-developed countries had expressed an interest to the agencies in organizing such round-tables. Each least-developed country would be assisted in the preparation of its round-table. The agencies felt that it was important to prepare the round-tables extremely well if they were to be successful and had advised the countries concerned accordingly. The round-tables would therefore take place at the earliest this summer, most probably not until the autumn. That stage of the process was in the hands of the least-developed countries.","WTCOMTDm19.pdf","UNDP, World, Bank, Consultative, Group"
"1329",1329,"86","86.      Second, the agencies had consulted among themselves and decided to put in place a more formal follow-up mechanism than the current inter-agency consultation process which had so far been functioning. The aim of the new mechanism was to achieve three things. One was to continue and to build on the currently functioning inter-agency coordination process. The six agencies would each be represented in an inter-agency working group which would manage the follow-up from the point of view of the six agencies. Secondly, the mechanism would create a focal point for least-developed countries, multilateral and regional intergovernmental organizations, and for other development partners of the least-developed countries to coordinate activities with a view to assisting individual least-developed countries to prepare and complete their round-table exercises. Third, the follow-up mechanism would undertake technical work. There was thus a need to establish a very small secretariat. It would not involve new resources but it would involve UNCTAD, WTO and ITC contributing to create a centralized secretariat unit which would among other things maintain databases of trade-related technical assistance provided to least-developed countries and help to develop the methodology for review and evaluation of that technical assistance. In addition, and as part of the follow-up mechanism, a focal point for least-developed countries would be established in each organization. Discussions were ongoing in the WTO Secretariat on how to best establish a functional unit that would serve as a focal point for least-developed countries. The follow-up mechanism would be available as a document as soon as it had been agreed with the other five agencies. It would also be included in the Director General's report to ministers at the May Ministerial Meeting.","WTCOMTDm19.pdf","UNCTAD, WTO, ITC, WTO, Secretariat, Director"
"1330",1330,"87","87.      The third point related to market access. The Secretariat had not received any formal notification of improved market access for least-developed countries. Delegations might recall that a number of announcements had been made at the High-Level Meeting by governments that were intending to improve market access for least-developed countries. The Secretariat was waiting for those notifications.

"1331",1331,"88","88.     The fourth point dealt with accessions. There were at present six least-developed countries in the process of accession. Of those six, Ethiopia and Laos had requested accession to the WTO since the High-Level Meeting and working parties had recently been established. In addition, Cap Verde had been granted observer status at the meeting of General Council on 19 February 1998. Bhutan had requested observer status in a communication dated 4 February 1998. In addition to the six least- developed countries already in the process of accession there were thus two others whose observer status was either decided or would be considered at the next meeting of the General Council.","WTCOMTDm19.pdf","Ethiopia, Laos, WTO, Cap, Verde, General, Council, Bhutan, General, Council"
"1332",1332,"89","89.     The fifth point related to Trade Policy Reviews. The Secretariat planned to cover four least- developed countries in its TPRs during 1998 which was an increase over 1997 when only one least- developed country had been dealt with in the TPR process. Three of the countries to be dealt with in 1998 would be grouped: Burkina Faso, Togo and Mali. Lesotho would be dealt with within the review of the South African Customs Union.","WTCOMTDm19.pdf","Secretariat, Burkina, Faso, Togo, Mali, Lesotho, Customs, Union"
"1333",1333,"9","9.       The representative of Switzerland noted with satisfaction that the introduction of the report mentioned that the three-year plan for technical cooperation and training was a valid instrument for planning and implementation. Her delegation hoped that the Committee on Trade and Development and the Secretariat would continue to develop and improve that important instrument. However, she regretted that the report provided too few elements for the Committee to evaluate and draw lessons from the ongoing technical cooperation and training activities. It was desirable that the Secretariat, in its report, provide elements of appreciation and qualitative evaluation. Distinguishing the programmes that functioned in a satisfactory way from those that did not would enable the Committee and the Secretariat to better adjust technical assistance. It would therefore be useful if the Secretariat could prepare a complementary note to the current report for the next meeting of the Committee. Future reports should systematically contain a qualitative element of evaluation. How many activities, projects or programmes had been internally or externally evaluated? What had been the main conclusions of those evaluations? Page 8, paragraph 9 of the report provided some technical information. Many activities consisted of giving information on products of interest to developing countries or on trade flows. That information should already be available with the ITC or UNCTAD. How was coordination between those organizations ensured to avoid duplication? Was there a joint database of the three organizations on existing studies on specific products or trade flows?","WTCOMTDm19.pdf","Switzerland, Committee, on, Trade, and, Development, Secretariat, Committee, Secretariat, Committee, Secretariat, Secretariat, Committee, ITC, UNCTAD"

The representative of Switzerland, in referring to document WT/COMTD/W/7, stated that it was essential for the WTO to carve out a positive role for itself as far as the provision of technical assistance was concerned. Agreeing with some of the points raised in the Secretariat document and by the representative of the Philippines, he indicated that the aim of such cooperation should be to ensure the creation of new synergies. He submitted that there were two levels of coordination: conceptual coordination relating to the design of technical assistance programmes and coordination relating to the programming of technical cooperation activities. He enquired whether the Secretariat had any on-going concrete technical cooperation project which it was coordinating with UNCTAD.","WTCOMTDM2.pdf","Switzerland, WTO, Secretariat, Philippines, Secretariat, UNCTAD"

In speaking about the need for cooperation between the WTO and other international organizations, the representative of the European Communities stated that whereas some international organizations had very specific technical cooperation programmes, others had programmes which were of relevance to the WTO's technical assistance activities. Agreeing with the representative of the Philippines, he stated that there was a need to be aware of the different activities being undertaken by other international organizations. Cooperation with these organizations should be strengthened by developing more systematic contacts, instead of working on an ad hoc basis. He further stated that the next step would be to ensure that these contacts were made on a regular basis, and that they covered the two aspects raised by the representative of Switzerland, i.e. the designing of programmes and the programming of activities.","WTCOMTDM2.pdf","WTO, European, Communities, WTO, Philippines, Switzerland"
"1346",1346,"12","12.      The representative of the Republic of Korea, recalling that there were around twenty-five countries in the process of acceding to the WTO, requested the Secretariat to provide technical assistance in the form of seminars for these countries. He believed such seminars would help the acceding countries, a majority of whom were developing countries, to become aware of what was expected of them. The representative of India was grateful to the Secretariat for having organized a regional seminar on anti-dumping in his country, and indicated that he would like to see similar seminars and workshops organized to analyze other topical subjects such as subsidies and countervailing measures, customs duties and other issues of a technical nature. Referring to the trade policy courses given by the Secretariat, the representative of El Salvador stated that they were useful and thorough.

The representative of Hong Kong, speaking in his capacity as Chairman of the Council for Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS), informed the Committee that contact had been made with the World Intellectual Property Organization and other relevant bodies to establish the resources they had available for technical cooperation. He stated that the TRIPS Council would have a wide-ranging debate on technical cooperation in its autumn session with a view to finding out the nature of assistance required by developing countries and how to mobilize resources to match these requirements.","WTCOMTDM2.pdf","Hong, Kong, Chairman, Committee, World, Intellectual, Property, Organization, TRIPS, Council"

The representative of Morocco stated that given the increased participation of developing countries and countries-in-transition in the WTO, it was necessary for the organization to increase its technical assistance activities, especially considering the complexity of some of the Uruguay Round Agreements. He submitted that since the WTO would have the responsibility for ensuring the implementation of the Uruguay Round Agreements, it was imperative for it to be made the focal point and the coordinator for technical cooperation activities, even for those carried out by other international organizations. In reference to the courses offered by the Secretariat, he indicated that his delegation favoured their restructuring; that instead of focusing generally on the WTO Agreements, specific Agreements could be analyzed each time, thus making it easier for officials to come to grips with the elements in each of the covered Agreements.

The representative of Norway stated that the document WT/COMTD/W/7 was a very useful document; he was of the view that it could be a valuable source of reference for institutions including governmental bodies which did not have the opportunity to closely follow the work of the WTO. He stated that his delegation attached great importance to the promotion of the WTO technical assistance activities vis-à-vis governmental bodies other than trade authorities, and that the forthcoming visit to the WTO by the Norwegian Minister of Development Cooperation to discuss the opportunities and challenges facing developing countries, especially least-developed countries, was evidence of the promotion of the work of the WTO in the area of trade and development. To enable trade authorities to maintain close contact with their development counterparts, he suggested that the Secretariat should endeavour to inform the CTD of all its technical assistance needs and any plans and strategies to meet those demands.","WTCOMTDM2.pdf","Norway, WTO, WTO, WTO, WTO, Secretariat, CTD"

After noting that resources were scarce in contemporary times, the representative of Costa Rica stated that in some areas such as sanitary and phytosanitary measures, rules of origin and environment, coordination should be sought and strengthened so as to avoid duplication. She considered it equally important to set out in advance the priorities, such as technical assistance which would be needed by Members to comply with their notification obligations and with the changes in the Harmonized System. She proposed that document WT/COMTD/W/7 be expanded to include a section on technical cooperation activities of other international organizations in the area of environment. She was of the view that the WTO could benefit from projects drawn up by UNCTAD on matters of relevance to the WTO, including technical assistance. The representative of Trinidad and Tobago indicated that the discussion had been productive and reminded delegations to press for increased resources for technical assistance in other fora in the WTO, especially in the Committee on Budget, Finance and Administration.","WTCOMTDM2.pdf","Costa, Rica, Members, WTO, UNCTAD, WTO, Trinidad, Tobago, WTO, Committee, on, Budget, ,, Finance, and, Administration"
"1351",1351,"17","17.      The Director of the Technical Cooperation and Training Division thanked delegations for their comments and stated that the technical assistance programme of the WTO was carried out in a balanced manner. The coordination of technical assistance activities with other international organizations was of primary concern not only for the Members, but also the Secretariat and the Director-General, who was active in that area. The Secretariat was discussing the issue of coordination with a number of organizations, in particular with UNCTAD and ITC, and would make all efforts to ensure the highest level of cooperation. Concerning synergies with UNCTAD, the Secretariat was exploring ways to make use of their regional programmes to give technical assistance in the areas where the WTO had competence. Some positive results had been obtained in Latin America and discussions were being held concerning Africa, which was to receive priority in the WTO's technical assistance programmes. With respect to the lack of financial resources, he indicated that the Secretariat was ensuring whether other organizations could, in the context of their programmes, finance technical assistance programmes of the WTO. He stated that positive responses had already been received from UNCTAD and ITC. Another initiative being pursued by the WTO was to request countries to make direct contributions. Limitations with respect to human resources were also a reality, particularly when the assistance was to be provided by officials from other divisions of the WTO who had their own responsibilities to meet. He said that the Secretariat was aware, and would be doing everything within its means, to assist delegations and capitals to comply with their notification obligations within the permitted time frames. In the future, the Secretariat would be including notification-related activities in its country programmes. As regards trade policy courses, he highlighted two limitations: the number of people each class could hold and the fellowships available (currently 24). He explained that as a result of informal consultations on the special circumstances of Eastern and Central European and Central Asian countries, the Secretariat had to reduce the duration of the regular training courses in order to make space for the special courses. He was of the view that these limitations could be partially countered either through voluntary contributions by Members, or by individual countries agreeing to bear the full costs associated with the participation of additional officials from their own countries. Finally he said that there should be an attempt in the near future to see how these limitations could be removed definitively. In response to questions raised by the representative of the Philippines, the Director of the Technical Cooperation                                                                             WT/COMTD/M/2                                                                             Page 5 and Training Division indicated that a plan detailing the technical cooperation activities of the WTO for the rest of the year was in the process of being drawn up. He indicated that the decision whether or not to grant technical assistance to a country depended on factors such as the last time the country received assistance, the level of participation of the country in WTO activities, and whether non-WTO funding was available for a particular type of activity. To ensure that many countries derived benefit from WTO's technical assistance programmes, the Secretariat favoured granting assistance at a sub- regional or regional level.","WTCOMTDM2.pdf","Director, Technical, Cooperation, and, Training, Division, WTO, Members, Secretariat, Director-General, Secretariat, UNCTAD, ITC, UNCTAD, Secretariat, WTO, Latin, America, Africa, WTO, Secretariat, WTO, UNCTAD, ITC, WTO, WTO, Secretariat, Secretariat, Secretariat, Members, Philippines, Director, Training, Division, WTO, WTO, WTO, Secretariat"

He said the document contained additional information which delegations would find useful such as the formats to be followed and the bodies to which the notifications were to be addressed. He referred to the two-day Workshop on Notifications, held in Geneva on 16 and 17 May 1995, at which presentations were made by WTO officials on all the relevant Uruguay Round Agreements. This was followed by bilateral discussions between participants of the Workshop and Secretariat officials. The Secretariat prepared a summary of the presentations made at the Workshop and sent it to all Members. It was believed that the document would enhance Members' awareness, especially those who could not attend the Workshop.","WTCOMTDM2.pdf","WTO, Chairman, CTD, Geneva, WTO, Uruguay, Secretariat, Secretariat, Members, Members"

Before turning to the agenda items, the Chairman urged delegations to use this first opportunity for putting the Committee on Trade and Development (CTD) on a path to increasing the participation of developing country Members in the multilateral trading system. He referred to two outstanding issues raised at the First Session of the CTD. He first reminded delegations about the proposal made by India concerning the terms of reference of the CTD. Since then, India had submitted a proposal in writing to him, and he had held preliminary discussions with certain delegations including India. The Chairman, however, stated that he would like to pursue further consultations with a larger number of delegations before submitting the proposal to the CTD for discussion. Second, referring to the matters raised by the representative of Argentina, speaking on behalf of the Informal Group of Developing Countries, he indicated that pursuant to his request, the document concerning the International Trade Center (ITC) had been transmitted to the Executive Director of the ITC through the Chairman of the General Council. With regard to the proposal for the setting up of a Working Group to examine possible areas of cooperation between the WTO and ITC with respect to technical cooperation activities and programmes, he stated that since the issue of cooperation between the WTO, the Bretton Woods Institutions and the United Nations and its specialized agencies was under active consideration, it would be prudent to defer discussion of the matter until the results of the broader consultations were known.","WTCOMTDM2.pdf","Chairman, Committee, on, Trade, and, Development, Members, CTD, India, India, India, Chairman, CTD, Argentina, Informal, Group, of, Developing, Countries, International, Trade, Center, ITC, Director, ITC, Chairman, General, Council, Working, Group, WTO, ITC, WTO, Bretton, Woods, Institutions, United, Nations"

Turning to the impact of the Round on developing country Members, the Chairman indicated that a number of background documents, which complemented other documents prepared by the Secretariat, had been made available to the CTD. These documents assessed the results of the Round from both a quantitative and a qualitative perspective. He said documents that analyzed the results from a qualitative perspective discussed issues such as the rights and obligations of developing country Members under the WTO, dealing in particular on any special and differential treatment afforded to them. He was of the view that the documents should enable the CTD to make a qualitative assessment of the impact of the Round on developing country Members. He indicated that this agenda item was of relevance to the issue of participation of developing countries in the multilateral trading system, which would be discussed in the next Session of the CTD. Given their complementarity, he said delegations could have a preliminary discussion on this issue and tackle it thoroughly at the next Session.","WTCOMTDM2.pdf","Members, Chairman, Secretariat, CTD, Members, WTO, CTD, Members, CTD"
"1356",1356,"21","21.     Introducing document WT/COMTD/W/5, the Chairman stated that it lucidly demonstrated in an analytical manner what was required to implement the commitments undertaken by developing country Members. He said that the approach used by the Secretariat was to classify the obligations according to their nature or effect. It did not cover all agreements individually, but rather a comprehensive list of the nature of the obligations involved was given and illustrated by a number of examples. Turning to documents WT/COMTD/W/6 and its addendum, he stated that they attempted to address the needs of developing country Members by assisting them to identify which new obligations required legislative action on their part. Whereas the two documents were complementary, the matrix provided a quick overview of the requirements in each area. Finally, he added that he considered document COMTD/W/510 prepared last year to be of relevance to the debate. WT/COMTD/M/2 Page 6","WTCOMTDM2.pdf","Chairman, Members, Secretariat, Members"

The representative of Morocco required some clarification on the Central Registry of Notification (CRN) which was established by the General Council but was not mentioned in WT/COMTD/W/1/Add.1. He suggested that the Secretariat compile all the formats for notifications in a single document. In response, the Director of the Technical Cooperation and Training Division indicated that the notifications should be sent to the relevant bodies, which would in turn pass them on to the CRN. A compilation of the notification formats was circulated as an informal document at the Workshop held in May, and would be issued as a WTO document in the near future.","WTCOMTDM2.pdf","Morocco, CRN, General, Council, Secretariat, Director, Technical, Cooperation, and, Training, Division, CRN, WTO"

He urged the Secretariat to raise the matter at the highest level of Administration. Recalling that the agenda item was closely related to point B of the programme of work, to be discussed in November, he proposed that the CTD agree to revert to this issue at its next meeting. He also indicated that those documents which required updating would be accordingly updated.

"1359",1359,"24","24.      The Chairman stated that, at the time of the adoption of the terms of reference for this Committee, it was also agreed that ""the programme of work of the WTO Committee on Trade and Development for 1995 would ... also include consideration of the question of credit and recognition for autonomous trade liberalization measures"". It was his view that the CTD would be able to achieve a meaningful result in this area. Without wishing to pre-empt the results of the CTD discussions, he stated that as one of the mandates of the WTO was to ensure increased coherence in global economic policy-making and intensify cooperation between the WTO and the two Bretton Woods Institutions, concrete results on the question of credit and recognition would demonstrate the carrying out of this mandate. Document WT/COMTD/W/4 (and Corr. 1 in the English version), which attempted to crystallize the issues involved under credit and recognition, would be a very useful guide for the debate, not only because of its exhaustiveness in detailing how the issue was dealt with during the Uruguay Round, but even more important, because of the identification of the context in which credit and recognition should be dealt with in the WTO. Delegations expressed their appreciation for the document.","WTCOMTDM2.pdf","Chairman, Committee, WTO, Committee, on, Trade, and, Development, CTD, CTD, WTO, WTO, Bretton, Woods, Institutions, Corr, Uruguay, WTO"
"1360",1360,"25","25.      The representative of Japan stated that his country welcomed any autonomous trade liberalization measures adopted by developing countries; it was important for other countries to show appreciation by encouraging developing countries to continue with their liberalization efforts notwithstanding the domestic pressures that they may face. However, dealing with ""credit and recognition"" after the conclusion of the Uruguay Round should be based a balanced approach. He supported his argument by saying that first, discussions on ""credit and recognition"" during the Uruguay Round negotiations were to some extent made to enhance the contribution of developing countries in the market access negotiations on goods. These were made under circumstances where it was thought that consideration should be given to the special situation of developing countries while, in principle, market access negotiations should be conducted on a reciprocal basis. It would fly in the face of all established principles if the same approach was to be followed after the Uruguay Round. Second, it was very difficult to give an objective judgment to autonomous liberalizing measures taken by a country when the appreciation of these measures was largely influenced by the interests of the respective trade partners. For that reason, guidelines - as distinct from formal rules - were presented by the Chairman of the Market Access Group, as a means to improve the contribution of the developing countries. They could not be established as the general rule. Japan believed that within the framework of the WTO, developing countries already enjoyed a ""Special and Differential"" treatment. If one allowed only developing countries to have ""credit and recognition"" for liberalization measures, it could affect the balance of rights and obligations between developing and developed countries.

The representative of Mexico recalled that her delegation was interested in this issue and particularly interested in the issues raised in paragraphs 14 and 15 of document WT/COMTD/W/4, i.e. the mechanics of crediting a country for autonomous measures undertaken by it. The credit and recognition of autonomous measures adopted by developing countries was a matter of great importance, as it could have a positive effect on the trade policies of most developing countries, especially where they receive improved market access without having to wait for any future multilateral negotiations. Mexico was interested in reviewing this subject and hoped that at a future meeting it could contribute effectively by advancing practical solutions.","WTCOMTDM2.pdf","Mexico, Mexico"
"1362",1362,"27","27.     The representative of Malaysia, speaking on behalf of ASEAN countries, recalled that ASEAN had been one of the sponsors of credit and recognition for autonomous liberalization measures, and that they continued to strongly support this concept. Unfortunately, previous deliberations had not advanced the implementation of this concept. As a result, ASEAN countries considered the issue as being one of the unfinished business of the Uruguay Round. They were of the view that the time had come to seriously think of ways of translating this concept into reality by finding a long-term solution. There was the need to accommodate autonomous liberalization measures within the WTO, especially considering that developing countries were now actively participating in the activities of the WTO. He noted that developing countries were pursuing liberal policies and undertaking liberalization initiatives with the belief that these measures would contribute towards their development efforts. These measures did not stop with the conclusion of the Uruguay Round, but were continuing, for example, under the programmes of the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF). Developing countries would feel more encouraged to liberalize if their initiatives were being recognized or given credit without having to wait for another round of negotiations. To ensure that progress was achieved, the concept of providing credit and recognition to autonomous liberalization measures should be operationalized. Delegations could, as a starting point, seriously analyze the proposals previously presented and any other new suggestions made by delegations.","WTCOMTDM2.pdf","Malaysia, ASEAN, ASEAN, ASEAN, Uruguay, Round, WTO, WTO, Uruguay, Round, World, Bank, International, Monetary, Fund, IMF"

The representative of the European Communities stated that the EC considered that the question of credit had been dealt with in the Uruguay Round negotiations, and that the results took due account of the request for credit. Furthermore, the Agreements contained many other provisions which provided for differential treatment in favour of developing countries. The EC appreciated autonomous liberalization efforts, but it thought that, in the first place, liberalization benefitted the liberalizing country itself. It would be difficult to see how the Committee could discuss further an issue that was largely dealt with in the Uruguay Round.","WTCOMTDM2.pdf","European, Communities, EC, Uruguay, EC, Committee, Uruguay, Round"
"1364",1364,"29","29.      The representative of Morocco recalled his country's attachment to the issue of credit and recognition. Surveying the world scene, he was struck by the paradox that has taken root in the developing world. For the past ten to fifteen years or even longer, most developing countries have been involved in reforming and restructuring programmes - under the aegis of the World Bank or the IMF, or independently - with the view to integrating themselves more fully into world trade. Developed countries restructured when it was politically and economically expedient. The WTO needed a machinery, which would be parallel to Article XXVIII, for dealing with tariffs independently reduced by Members. There was no logical explanation why a Member would be obliged to offer compensation anytime it increased its tariffs, but would not get compensation when it reduced its tariffs. The current situation could not be justified, especially considering that the benefits would mainly accrue to the trading partners, and in certain instances the main supplier. Compensation would have to be provided by the main beneficiaries of the liberalization measures undertaken. WT/COMTD/M/2 Page 8","WTCOMTDM2.pdf","Morocco, World, Bank, IMF, WTO, Members, Member"

The representative of the United States stressed that, in the history of this debate, developed countries indicated their unwillingness to give credit for unbound liberalization measures. His country greatly appreciated and supported autonomous liberalization measures, as they were to the benefit of the countries adopting these measures. He noted that the basic obligation in the WTO, and previously in the GATT, was the binding of measures under the system.

The representative of the United States expressed his delegation's disappointment with the cancellation of the scheduled 12-13 June meeting of the Working Party on MERCOSUR, particularly since the Parties to the Agreement cancelled it with only two days notice. Considerable time and effort had been put into the preparation of the meeting by the Secretariat, participating delegations, and the Parties themselves. Further, cancellation on such short notice required the Secretariat to pay the interpreters for the meeting. The United States had a strong interest in MERCOSUR and would like to begin reviewing the Agreement as soon as possible. To that end, his delegation hoped that a date in early September could be secured for such a meeting and asked that MERCOSUR members confirm a time when they would be ready to respond to the questions of the Working Party. He indicated that in the process of preparing for the scheduled June Working Party meeting, his government noted that the Parties to the Agreement had failed to provide certain pertinent information. Specifically, information necessary to evaluate MERCOSUR tariff commitments against the WTO obligations of the four MERCOSUR members was being sought. This information would have to include three years of trade data by 8-digit tariff line, specifying individual partner trade, bound, applied and preferential duty rates for each country, as well as concordance between the nomenclature of each country's Uruguay Round tariff schedule and the MERCOSUR common external tariff nomenclature. His delegation would ask the MERCOSUR parties to provide that data to members of the Working Party and to the Secretariat as soon as possible. Finally, his delegation would also ask the Secretariat to begin the tariff analysis for customs unions required in paragraph 5 of the WTO Understanding on Article XXIV. He stressed the importance of the analysis for the work of the Working Party. The representative of the European Communities supported the intervention made by the United States, and expressed his delegation's surprise and disappointment with this second cancellation of the meeting of the MERCOSUR Working Party.

MERCOSUR was committed to work closely together with the Secretariat, and he expected the Working Party to meet shortly after the summer recess.","WTCOMTDM2.pdf","Uruguay, MERCOSUR, MERCOSUR, Secretariat, MERCOSUR, Secretariat, Working, Party"

He proposed that in view of the decision that had just been adopted by the CTD, the rules of procedure of the CTD, as contained in document WT/COMTD/W/3, be adopted.

With regard to the issue of which institutions should be granted observer status in the CTD, the Chairman stated that since the General Council had not yet finalized the rules on observership, the CTD should continue to follow its ad hoc procedures.

He drew the attention of delegates to document WT/COMTD/W/7, which was requested at that meeting. He stated that an attempt had been made to highlight the salient features of the technical assistance programme of the WTO Secretariat and that of other intergovernmental organizations, whose assistance and cooperation would be required in the implementation of the Uruguay Round Agreements.","WTCOMTDM2.pdf","Chairman, CTD, WTO, Secretariat, Uruguay"
"1374",1374,"7","7.       Delegations expressed their appreciation for the documents prepared by the Secretariat. There was unanimous support for the WTO Secretariat to coordinate its technical assistance activities with other international organizations with a view to removing any overlap in their programmes. The representatives of a number of developing countries expressed satisfaction with the work of the Technical Cooperation and Training Division and called for an increase in resources for the Division so as to enable it to effectively meet the increasing technical assistance needs of developing countries. A number of representatives stated that the seminar on notification requirements was helpful and encouraged similar workshops to be held from time to time. Some delegations indicated that information on notification requirements was still incomplete and called for more assistance to be given in this area, not the least because of the non-representation in Geneva of a number of developing countries.","WTCOMTDM2.pdf","Secretariat, WTO, Secretariat, Technical, Cooperation, and, Training, Division, Geneva"

The representative of the United States, referring to the ""future activities"" in document WT/COMTD/W/7, requested more details from the Secretariat on the type of programmes which were under consideration to assist developing countries in meeting their notification and other WTO obligations.

"1376",1376,"9","9.       The representative of the Philippines drew the attention of delegates to the discussions being held at the meeting of Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC) on coordination and cooperation between the various intergovernmental organizations. She stated that with respect to technical cooperation, closer relationship between the United Nations, its specialized agencies and functional commissions, and the WTO was feasible, and that the relationship between the WTO and the UN, as agreed to by WTO Members, did allow for such closer collaboration. She was of the view that more work could be done on how to coordinate technical cooperation activities, so as to avoid overlapping in some areas and lack of assistance in other areas. With respect to the objectives of technical assistance and its programming in a given year, she pointed out that while reports on technical assistance were submitted to ECOSOC, this happened only once a year during meetings of ECOSOC. She cautioned that unless the WTO was able to plan its technical assistance activities for the entire year in advance, effective coordination of activities with other organizations would be quite difficult, unless a formal understanding was reached with them to meet at least on a quarterly basis. Coordination could help to solve some of the WTO constraints relating to funding, as some of the UN organizations had the necessary funds at their disposal. She stressed the importance of technical assistance in providing meaningful training to officials from developing countries and helping them in the formulation of policies. She also stated that long-term planning of technical cooperation activities was necessary, especially where a seminar was jointly being planned and organized by two or more institutions. Developing countries needed more than ever technical assistance directed towards enhancing their competitiveness after the implementation of the Uruguay Round Agreements.

In that context, UNDP, in close collaboration with the other five agencies, continued to play a very active role in the follow-up actions to the High-Level Meeting in the area of designing and implementing trade-related technical assistance.

Bangladesh believed that there was a legal and practical necessity to undertake the evaluation and analysis that had been requested because full implementation of the special provisions was essential to the integration of the least-developed countries into the multilateral trading system. Although the Secretariat Note WT/COMTD/W/35 had pointed out that preambular language could not be meaningfully applied, yet they constituted integral parts of the WTO Agreements. The implementation of the special provisions was a matter of vital interest for Bangladesh. It was essential to determine the reasons why developed countries could not implement the special provisions, and to identify the areas of difficulties.","WTCOMTDM21.pdf","Bangladesh, Morocco, India, Bangladesh, Secretariat, WTO, Bangladesh"
"1394",1394,"11","11.      The representative of the United States said his delegation had mixed responses to the three proposals by Morocco. The proposals were useful because they helped to focus on further work. On the first issue, it was clear that all countries faced challenges in implementing the special provisions. In this connection, further discussions would be fruitful because it would identify the difficulties, highlight the concerns and frustrations of both developed and developing countries in failing to implement certain provisions. His delegation considered that it was not the job of the Secretariat to collate such matters. Members should state their specific concerns. The task of assessing and evaluating was for Members, not for the Secretariat.","WTCOMTDM21.pdf","United, States, Morocco, Secretariat, Members, Members, Secretariat"

His delegation wondered what more could be done in this regard.","WTCOMTDM21.pdf","Secretariat"
"1396",1396,"13","13.      He was sceptical about the third proposal to redefine and re-work the concept of S&D. Time was required for reflection. There could be counterproductive implications to such broad, generic discussions, as in the 1980s. They could produce a North-South divide, and inhibit progress by both developed and developing countries. He considered that the S&D discussion could be more productive if focused on specific issues and situations. The parameters of the discussions would be to determine if the S&D provisions in the WTO Agreements were workable, and, if they were not, how they could be improved. The Committee should avoid controversy, and understand that there were limitations on tasks for the Secretariat as opposed to what Members could do.","WTCOMTDM21.pdf","WTO, Committee, Secretariat, Members"

The European Communities were committed to implementation, which was an essential part of WTO operations. To this end, difficulties that arose should be addressed. In order to be effective, her delegation was in favour of focusing on specific issues and identifying particular problem areas as opposed to open-ended general discussions.

Her delegation noted that the importance of implementation had been underscored at the First Meeting of African Trade Ministers, as contained in the Report of that meeting, circulated by the Permanent Mission of Zimbabwe in WT/COMTD/W/43. Her delegation urged other developing countries to follow the example of African countries in conducting national assessments of the implementation of the Uruguay Round Agreements. This was an essential first step in addressing the subject of implementation, and thereafter in determining what further steps would be required.

The problems addressed should be brought to the Committee by the affected countries. In response, therefore, to Morocco's proposal for a more analytical and conceptual exercise, her delegation preferred avoiding an abstract exercise and also avoiding a confrontational exchange of views.

The representative of Tanzania supported the Moroccan proposal that the Committee should go beyond factual reporting of the implementation of special provisions and evaluating their impact, and also supported Bangladesh, on behalf of the least-developed countries for a mechanism to evaluate implementation. The Secretariat needed to take note of this concern. He supported the position of the United States that the Committee should not rush into an overall evaluation of the special provisions, but proceed cautiously. Fundamental questions could arise, such as who qualifies for S&D, which could be counterproductive. Tanzania emphasised that while the current discussions focused on implementation with regard to S&D, there was a need to focus on the overall problems regarding implementation, and thereupon search for solutions. This approach had been mandated by the Ministerial Conference. Problems and difficulties should be identified and collated by the Secretariat, and then discussed at the level of the General Council.","WTCOMTDM21.pdf","Tanzania, Committee, Bangladesh, Secretariat, United, States, Committee, Tanzania, Secretariat, General, Council"

While a basis was required for further work, the Secretariat could not be expected to prepare every sort of analysis. Some types of analysis needed to be Member-driven. To this end, his delegation would like to determine from developing countries and least-developed countries what particular issues they would like to study.

He favoured the caveat by the United States and Tanzania on the need to proceed with caution. His delegation had noted that in all declarations and Ministerial statements, developing countries had stated that they were encountering problems with regard to implementation. However, it was the duty of developing countries to identify concrete areas and submit proposals where they were having problems.

The representative of Norway emphasised that although his delegation did not disagree with the Moroccan proposals to evaluate the impact of the special provisions, nonetheless it preferred a modified approach in which concerned countries, particularly developing countries, outlined their concrete experiences.

The concerns of developing countries should not be ruled out. If developing countries wanted a broader debate, their preference for this approach should be accommodated. Brazil had noted that several countries wanted an ambitious agenda for the next trade round. These countries should note that others wanted a proper assessment of the status of implementation before proceeding further.

The Committee needed to understand the different approaches and gain from the experiences of other, for instance UNCTAD.

To this end, contributions by Members should identify issues and focus on particular problems given the large scope of issues in the area under consideration. Second, the Committee should proceed cautiously, sensibly and with perspective. The work of the Committee should be anchored on concrete experiences, practical issues, and clear questions.

Members should focus on specific problems and difficulties of implementation. At the High-Level Meeting his delegation had announced commitments to provide special treatment to least-developed countries. However, implementing the commitments presented difficulties similar to those experienced by other developing countries. The problem was that there appeared to be no firm legal basis in WTO rules for accommodating commitments for autonomous market access improvements, including under the so called Enabling Clause. Existing provisions appeared insufficient. There was a strong will on the part of various developed and developing countries, like Korea, to implement the measures, but in a rule-based organization, such as the WTO, Korea wanted to act in accordance with the rules. This was the reason that Korea had not yet finalized its implementation of its commitments. Therefore, rather than waste time by requesting the Secretariat to provide assessment papers, countries that encountered difficulties should clearly state the difficulties, just as Korea had done. To this end, frank informal consultations would be more fruitful than formal meetings in addressing problems encountered in the application of the special provisions.","WTCOMTDM21.pdf","Republic, of, Korea, Members, WTO, Korea, WTO, Korea, Korea, Secretariat, Korea"

Morocco simply sought a functional, positive and constructive dialogue. Third, several international organizations such as the IMF, the World Bank, UNDP and WT/COMTD/M/21 Page 6 UNCTAD regularly conducted assessments of the impact of their decisions on the trade of developing countries.

The Chairman reminded delegations that problems encountered in the course of implementation was an issue to which individual Ministers, at the recent WTO Ministerial Conference had referred. In addition, paragraph 8 of the Ministerial Declaration stated: ""When we meet at the Third Session we shall further pursue our evaluation of the implementation of individual agreements and the realization of their objectives. Such evaluation would cover, inter alia, the problems encountered in implementation and the consequent impact on the trade and development prospects of Members"". Also, the Director-General made reference to this issue in his Report to Ministers on the High-Level Meeting for the Least-Developed Countries: ""Without a strong commitment by WTO Members to finance in the budget the growing needs of technical assistance in an appropriate way, the essential objective of implementation of commitments made in the Uruguay Round, especially by the developing and least-developed countries, could be in serious jeopardy"".","WTCOMTDM21.pdf","Members, Uruguay, Round, Chairman, WTO, Ministerial, Conference, Members, Director-General, WTO, Members, Uruguay, Round"

"1417",1417,"32","32.     Finally, the Chairman recalled his informal consultations on 24 April, 1998, at which he sought the views of delegations on how he might best proceed with the subject. At the informal consultations he had drawn two conclusions. First, there was a widely-shared need for an educational process on electronic commerce; to this end, account should be taken of work in other organizations, notably UNCTAD. Second, Members needed to avoid unnecessary overlap amongst different WTO bodies in discussing electronic commerce.","WTCOMTDM21.pdf","Chairman, UNCTAD, Members, WTO"
"1418",1418,"33","33.     The Chairman called for comments focusing mainly on how work could be usefully done on this subject in the Committee on Trade and Development, bearing in mind the need to avoid overlap with other WTO bodies and to avoid duplication of work with other organisations.

"1419",1419,"34","34.      The representative of Tanzania requested clarification on how to proceed with the discussions on electronic commerce in the light of the language by Ministers in the Ministerial Declaration instructing the General Council to: ""establish a comprehensive work programme to examine all trade- related issues relating to global electronic commerce"". His delegation requested a clarification as to whether this instruction implied that a special working group would be established, or that the Committee Trade and Development should proceed without further delay? His delegation understood paragraph 7 of the Egyptian paper to suggest that it was within the mandate of the Committee to discuss electronic commerce.","WTCOMTDM21.pdf","Tanzania, General, Council, Committee, Trade, and, Development, Committee"
"1420",1420,"35","35.      The Chairman noted that the Ministerial Council was the highest WTO body; accordingly, its decision was final. However, he also noted that the text of the Ministerial Declaration on electronic commerce included the phrase that, ""The work programme will involve the relevant World Trade Organization (""WTO"") bodies"". The Chairman assumed that this phrase very clearly encompassed the Committee on Trade and Development. Nonetheless, he requested Members, in their comments, to offer their views on the clarification sought by the representative of Tanzania.","WTCOMTDM21.pdf","Chairman, Ministerial, Council, WTO, World, Trade, Organization, Chairman, Committee, on, Trade, and, Development, Members, Tanzania"
"1421",1421,"36","36.     The representative of Egypt recognised the importance of the point raised by Tanzania. Nonetheless, he recalled that there were five requests in paragraph 49 of the Egyptian paper – WT/COMTD/W/38. Some of these could overlap with the process that might take place in the General Council. In spite of this possibility, Egypt believed that work could begin in the Committee since the subject had been discussed in the Committee on Trade and Development, and their paper had been presented months previously, and that the process should start with the Secretariat preparing the analytical paper which his delegation had requested. The Ministerial Declaration stated that work could begin in the relevant WTO bodies taking into account the development needs of the developing countries.","WTCOMTDM21.pdf","Egypt, Tanzania, General, Council, Egypt, Committee, Committee, on, Trade, and, Development, Secretariat, WTO"
"1422",1422,"37","37.      He emphasised the importance of addressing the issue of the enhanced participation of developing countries in electronic commerce. He provided information to the Committee on the meeting that was hosted by the Economic Commission for Africa (ECA), on the essential issues relating to the provision of cost-effective global connectivity, and computer/internet access to the poor, in particular women. At this Conference, the World Bank estimated that the challenge of providing the poor with information technology involved raising connectivity rates from 5 lines per 1,000 to 5 lines per 100. It was observed that China had been able to accomplish this target. China had a penetration of 8 lines per 100. Initially, when Africa was connected to the internet, only the educated and the wealthy had access to information technology. This pattern had not significantly changed. The urgent objective was to connect the poor. A 1995 African regional symposium on telecommunications and development had stressed the importance of building Africa's information infrastructure. At that time, only four African countries had full internet connectivity; in 1997, 47 countries achieved full internet connectivity. Experts had proposed that the profile of Africa's internet and information technology connectivity needed to be changed through better infrastructures, more effective government policies, innovative educational programmes to access the majority of people, and ensuring that the poor and the young could also benefit from this technology. This was a crucial and dynamic area. Much had been accomplished in various international organizations. The WTO had a role to play, in particular in relation to internet trade-related issues.","WTCOMTDM21.pdf","Committee, Economic, Commission, Africa, ECA, World, Bank, China, China, Africa, Africa, Africa, WTO"
"1423",1423,"38","38.    The representative of the United States agreed that the Committee on Trade and Development had a clear role and responsibility in the work programme decided by Ministers on electronic commerce. Egypt's paper was constructive. Evidently, the issues raised by Egypt would be part of the work programme. At the same time, Members must be deferential to the process in the General Council, and allow the Council to determine the specific responsibilities of different bodies. However, his delegation believed that some activity could go on in the interim. First, the Committee could begin immediately to consider the role of electronic commerce in technical cooperation. Second, it would be useful to be informed of work by UNCTAD. UNCTAD could be asked to WT/COMTD/M/21 Page 8 provide a paper for the information of the Committee on its activity, in order to avoid duplication and overlap. Third, the United States would support the proposal for a special Committee meeting or seminar on electronic commerce as part of the work programme of the Committee on Trade and Development. Fourth, it was early to respond to Tanzania's question as to whether there will be a special body to address the subject of electronic commerce, but even informally his delegation had not understood that there would be any proposals to that effect. However, his delegation would counsel patience until the General Council had taken a decision apportioning responsibilities.","WTCOMTDM21.pdf","United, States, Committee, on, Trade, and, Development, Egypt, Egypt, Members, General, Council, Council, Committee, UNCTAD, UNCTAD, Committee, United, States, Committee, Committee, on, Trade, and, Development, Tanzania, General, Council"
"1424",1424,"39","39.      The representative of Brazil noted the caution hinted at by the United States, and agreed this was necessary. However, the Committee should not be idle on the subject while waiting for the General Council, nor feel hindered by the fact that the General Council had not yet decided on the structure and scope of the work programme. It was useful to know that there was a lot of informal activity that was already taking place. His delegation was not aware of these informal activities and consultations. He believed that Members had to discuss the subjects fully, and acquire a knowledge of what they were negotiating and what the stakes were. He recalled that one of the reasons for the difficulty in negotiating the draft Ministerial Declaration was the fact that in many instances, delegations did not know what the implications were and also, in several instances, did not know what the proposals were. Members of the Committee should be fully involved, and the development needs of the developing countries should be fully taken into account. Brazil regretted that there had been no response yet to the requests made by the Egyptian delegation four months ago. It was further regrettable that the Committee was still at the stage of discussing ""starting work"". Brazil, therefore, supported the Egyptian proposal that work should begin immediately.","WTCOMTDM21.pdf","Brazil, United, States, Committee, General, Council, General, Council, Members, Members, Committee, Brazil, Committee, Brazil"
"1425",1425,"4","4.      Second, informal consultations showed that some delegations believed it would be useful for the Committee to discuss the issue of ""special and differential"" treatment (S&D) not only in the context of the implementation of various provisions in individual WTO Agreements, but also at a broad, conceptual level. WT/COMTD/M/21 Page 2","WTCOMTDM21.pdf","Committee"
"1426",1426,"40","40.      The representative of Morocco welcomed the Egyptian paper and expressed support for the efforts of Egypt to conduct an educational exercise on the issue for Members in the Committee before decisions were taken on the subject. It supported the Egyptian proposals. To a considerable degree, the paper covered developing country concerns, although there were some issues and difficulties not reflected in the document. First, there was the difficulty that several countries did not yet have competition law or policy. The debate proposed by Egypt and the analysis requested would have a positive effect because it would assist competent authorities to adapt their legislation to trends in electronic commerce. Second, it was still unclear how fiscal and taxation policies would be managed in electronic commerce. His delegation had taken note of the proposal by the U.S. Third, there was the difficulty of correctly managing the infrastructure in order to make it possible for developing countries to integrate into this infrastructure, and thus forestall any further marginalization of developing countries. His delegation had more concerns. These would be raised and coordinated with Egypt. Morocco supported the Egyptian proposal for a special session of the Committee on Trade and Development to address the subject of the electronic commerce. Finally, his delegation emphasised the importance of inter-organizational cooperation and the mobilization of synergies in order to avoid overlap and duplication. The organizations that could usefully cooperate on this subject included UNCTAD, WTO and International Telecommunications Union (ITU).","WTCOMTDM21.pdf","Morocco, Egypt, Members, Committee, Egypt, U.S., Egypt, Morocco, Committee, on, Trade, and, Development, UNCTAD, WTO, International, Telecommunications, Union, ITU"
"1427",1427,"41","41.      The representative of Switzerland noted that although new interests tended to excite, nonetheless, there was a need to proceed methodically. Ministers had mandated the General Council to prepare a work programme. Therefore, the Committee should wait for the General Council to draw up a work programme before it began work on electronic commerce or requested the Secretariat to prepare studies. It was likely that the work programme to be drawn up by the General Council would include a large part if not all of the Egyptian proposals. Switzerland would like to avoid the situation in which different WTO bodies decided their own work programmes, and requested the Secretariat to prepare studies which may overlap.","WTCOMTDM21.pdf","Switzerland, General, Council, Committee, General, Council, Secretariat, General, Council, Switzerland, WTO, Secretariat"
"1428",1428,"42","42.     The representative of the European Communities stated that her delegation had now had the time to consider the Egyptian proposals and saw merit in the suggestions. The Communities would accord varying emphasis on different aspects, for instance on mode of delivery, the impact of                                                                                    WT/COMTD/M/21                                                                                            Page 9 electronic commerce on trade, the role of government, and what space there would be for regulation. All these issues had to be addressed, and the outcome was still far away. Her delegation believed that the Ministerial Declaration was useful in the sense that it provided an indicative deadline for the consideration of electronic commerce. This indication would assist in focusing the mind of delegations on the work programme. Her delegation considered that the Committee should contribute to the decision to be adopted by the General Council in September. The Declaration did not restrict work to a particular body, but mentioned bodies of the WTO. The Egyptian paper covered many points which the work programme could take into account. A role existed for the Committee. For example, the second bullet of paragraph 8 of the Egyptian paper pointed to an important angle of consideration by the Committee.","WTCOMTDM21.pdf","Committee, General, Council, WTO, Committee, Committee"
"1429",1429,"43","43.     The Communities also re-iterated several areas of importance contained in the presentation by Egypt, including the importance of having correct and proper infrastructure and increasing the participation of developing countries in line with various WTO provisions, such as Article 4 of the GATS. The period between now and the Special Session in September was very short. Although her delegation believed that holding a special session of the Committee on Trade and Development at this time was premature, work on other aspects could start immediately. The Secretariat could begin the preparation of factual and analytical papers, tapping on the resources and contributions of other organizations such as UNCTAD. The proposals by Egypt were necessary and useful, but needed proper timing to ensure work efficiency. The Communities reminded Members that they had also put forward several proposals in their paper on which they desired the view of Members. In this regard, her delegation informed Members that they were available for informal discussions on any ideas by Members on the proposals presented by the European Communities.","WTCOMTDM21.pdf","Egypt, WTO, GATS, Committee, on, Trade, and, Development, Secretariat, UNCTAD, Egypt, Members, Members, Members, Members, European, Communities"
"1430",1430,"44","44.     The representative of Hong Kong, China welcomed the paper by Egypt. He said that electronic commerce potentially covered a wide area of WTO activity, and also covered a wide area of activity by other organizations and national governments. The Special Session of the General Council in September would need to consider how best to handle WTO work. His delegation would not rule out any of the options that had been suggested on how work would proceed. However, given that the subject was complex and wide-ranging, some caution was merited. Hong Kong, China, expressed satisfaction on the Secretariat paper that had been presented, and wondered if the Secretariat could actually do more, in the light of the fact that Members needed to further consider the item and take some policy decisions. His delegation suggested that bullet points two and three of paragraph 49 of the WT/COMTD/W/35 could be started immediately. The last two bullets could require a special seminar and therefore could wait until after the Special Session of the General Council.","WTCOMTDM21.pdf","Hong, Kong, China, Egypt, WTO, General, Council, WTO, Hong, Kong, China, Secretariat, Secretariat, Members, General, Council"
"1431",1431,"45","45.      The representative of Japan welcomed the paper by Egypt. Electronic commerce was important for the further development of developing countries. The issues raised by the representative of Switzerland on the need for being methodical and for coherence in the work of the WTO were important. His delegation emphasised the importance of an overall work programme as contained in the Ministerial Declaration. Duplication must be avoided both in the WTO and with other international fora. Work and experience elsewhere could be usefully tapped, for instance, at UNCTAD. His delegation suggested that a contribution should be received from UNCTAD before work commenced. He referred to the meeting being organized by UNCTAD in the autumn, a ""Partnership for Development Summit"" meeting in Glion. His delegation understood that substantial attention, at this meeting, would be devoted to electronic commerce. UNCTAD had worked extensively in this area, and its experience would be useful. This was particularly relevant with regard to indent two in paragraph 49 of the Egyptian paper. His delegation considered that a special meeting of the Committee on Trade and Development dedicated to electronic commerce was a good one. However, such a meeting should take place after the Special Session of the General Council. Duplication must be avoided in the work of WTO bodies. To this end, work in the Committee must be complementary to work in the General Council.

"1432",1432,"46","46.      The representative of India welcomed the Egyptian proposals. His delegation emphasised four points. First, it noted that the proposals by Egypt had been properly inscribed on the Committee's agenda four months previously, and were therefore consistent with the procedures of the Committee. The intention of the paper to focus on the development dimension of electronic commerce was very important. The Egyptian paper was entirely consistent with both the procedures of the Committee and with the mandate of the Ministerial Declaration. Second, the proposals contained in paragraph 49 of the Egyptian paper were all extremely important. India considered that the factual paper, as requested in the first indent of the Egyptian paper, should be prepared by the Secretariat. His delegation noted that reference had been made to the study produced by the Secretariat, but it had expressed its view at an earlier meeting that the development dimension had not been adequately addressed in that paper. He felt that the second and fifth indents in the Egyptian paper could be combined. Third, his delegation supported the idea of a seminar, and this idea did not have to wait for the Special Session of the General Council. His delegation was also interested in a special session of the Committee on Trade and Development because it would assist Members in focusing on the development dimension of the issue. His delegation requested the Chairman to consult on the special session. Fourth, the representative of India noted that the functioning of the General Council should not restrict the Committee on Trade and Development. If any difficulties arose, India felt that the Chairman of the Committee on Trade and Development could take the floor to inform the General Council of the work being done in the Committee.","WTCOMTDM21.pdf","India, Egypt, Committee, Committee, Committee, India, Secretariat, Secretariat, General, Council, Committee, on, Trade, and, Development, Members, Chairman, India, General, Council, Committee, on, Trade, and, Development, India, Chairman, Committee, on, Trade, and, Development, General, Council, Committee"
"1433",1433,"47","47.      The representative of Australia appealed for coherence in the work of the different WTO bodies on electronic commerce. Work in the Committee on Trade and Development was not parallel to or an annex to work in the General Council, but an integral part of the work of the General Council. Members should not be concerned about what the General Council would do because Members of the Committee were also the Members of the General Council. Her delegation observed that the Egyptian paper contained key elements that could form part of the Committee's work programme. Morocco's intervention had also highlighted some other issues in electronic commerce. Australia would urge Members to make inputs into the General Council's work programme. Her delegation was concerned that some thought that a vacuum existed. Australia considered that no such vacuum existed. The Committee on Trade and Development could begin to examine indent three of the Egyptian proposal, and also begin to consider the dimension of technical cooperation. Her delegation agreed with Hong Kong, China, on approaches. Her delegation agreed that the proposed seminar and special session on electronic commerce were good ideas, but it would be essential to first have the picture of an overall integral work programme.","WTCOMTDM21.pdf","Australia, WTO, Committee, on, Trade, and, Development, General, Council, General, Council, Members, General, Council, Members, Committee, Members, General, Council, Committee, Morocco, Australia, Members, General, Council, Australia, Committee, on, Trade, and, Development, Hong, Kong, China"
"1434",1434,"48","48.      The representative of Canada noted that the points raised by Egypt would be worth pursuing. Timing was essential. Canada's preference was that work in the Committee should be postponed until after the Special Session of the General Council in September. Members should make sure that the work programme reflected development concerns as outlined in the Ministerial Declaration. The Committee on Trade and Development would have an important role to play in the implementation of the work programme.","WTCOMTDM21.pdf","Canada, Egypt, Canada, Committee, General, Council, Members, Committee, on, Trade, and, Development"
"1435",1435,"49","49.     The representative of Mexico underscored three points. First, electronic commerce was an important subject in international markets. All countries, including the developed countries, needed to subject it to careful examination in order to assess its impact, particularly on development. Second, the Egyptian paper was extremely useful, as was the WTO Secretariat study. Since the Committee on Trade and Development had already initiated work and made some progress, particularly on the development aspects, it should continue.            Account needed to be taken of whatever the General Council proposed. Third, the Secretariat should produce a factual paper on the lines suggested by the Egyptian delegation. His delegation considered that the Chairman should convene an informal meeting, after the regular meeting of the General Council to examine the factual paper by the WTO and also the Egyptian paper. There should also be inputs from Members and from the UNCTAD. The results of this informal meeting could then be conveyed to the General Council in                                                                                   WT/COMTD/M/21                                                                                          Page 11 September, by the Chairman.

The representative of Morocco said his delegation attached importance to the implementation of S&D provisions in the WTO agreements and in special Ministerial Decisions in favour of developing countries, in particular the least-developed. These provisions were integral parts of the Agreements and Decisions and were intended to strike a balance between countries at different levels of development. His delegation welcomed the Secretariat document, and had observed from it that a large part of these provisions had not been implemented, and in fact could not be implemented.","WTCOMTDM21.pdf","Morocco, WTO, Secretariat"
"1437",1437,"50","50.     The representative of Ecuador stated that the Committee should accord due consideration to the points raised by the Tanzanian Ambassador. His delegation noted that some Members had counselled caution. However, to maintain the momentum of work in this area and to strengthen the overall process, the Committee should not become immobilised. Drive and impetus in the consideration of the subject of electronic commerce needed to be maintained. To this need, his delegation gave support to the proposals by Egypt.","WTCOMTDM21.pdf","Ecuador, Committee, Ambassador, Members, Committee, Egypt"
"1438",1438,"51","51.      The representative of Uruguay noted that there was merit in the Egyptian proposal on the role to be played by the Committee on electronic commerce. His delegation further noted that the Committee on Trade and Development was a competent body to discuss the subject. In doing so, the economic, financial and the development needs of developing countries should also be taken into account which further highlighted the important role to be played by the Committee on Trade and Development. Nonetheless, Members should ensure that the General Council identified the overall work programme in September. Elsewhere, such as in UNCTAD, the subject was gaining momentum. For instance, in UNCTAD consideration was being accorded to obstacles confronted by developing countries in electronic commerce. Other Organizations could also make useful inputs such as in the ITU and the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO). His delegation considered that it would be possible for the Committee to suggest to the General Council that certain parameters for examining the subject be set-out. This approach could assist the General Council in establishing an overall work programme in September. While noting that Mexico had suggested an informal meeting to consider all aspects of the work, Uruguay took the view that it was up to the General Council to determine the final work programme.","WTCOMTDM21.pdf","Uruguay, Committee, Committee, on, Trade, and, Development, Committee, on, Trade, and, Development, Members, General, Council, UNCTAD, UNCTAD, ITU, World, Intellectual, Property, Organization, WIPO, Committee, General, Council, General, Council, Mexico, Uruguay, General, Council"

The representative of Uganda welcomed the Egyptian paper and gave his support to the proposals contained in paragraph 49 of the paper which would assist in deepening understanding of the subject. His delegation further supported the preparation of factual and analytical papers, including the idea of a seminar. Uganda was certain that the proposals in paragraph 49 of the Egyptian paper were not inconsistent with the Ministerial Declaration. Concerns and fears about the duplication of work were exaggerated.","WTCOMTDM21.pdf","Uganda, Uganda"
"1440",1440,"53","53.     The representative of South Africa noted the overwhelming support for the Egyptian proposal as a basis for work in the Committee. His delegation supported those proposals, but said that they should not been considered exhaustive. There should be scope for other delegations should they wish to contribute. The proposals were not contradictory to the essence of the Ministerial Declaration, which stated that the General Council should establish a work programme.","WTCOMTDM21.pdf","South, Africa, Committee, General, Council"
"1441",1441,"54","54.      The representative of Egypt placed on record Egypt's appreciation to Members who had supported their proposals. He observed that the discussions had become more focused and beneficial, and emphasised the importance of engaging all organizations that were involved in the examination of the subject. Apart from UNCTAD and ITC, there were other relevant organizations which were engaged, including the ITU, United Nations Commission on International Trade Law (UNCITRAL), WIPO, etc. Egypt's main concern was the position taken by those who wanted to await the results of the General Council in establishing an overall work programme before work began in the Committee. If this was the case, it meant that the Committee would have to wait until September. Thereafter, the Committee could only begin work later on in the year to request the Secretariat to produce a paper, and UNCTAD to make its contributions. This, inevitably, would shift the process to 1999. This shift would not only slow down the process, but could also not be reconciled with the position of those delegations who were urging quick movement on this and other issues. His delegation emphasised, for the record, that the development perspective was a fundamental prerequisite to any discussion on the subject of electronic commerce. If electronic commerce was not addressed in a comprehensive WT/COMTD/M/21 Page 12 and balanced manner, that satisfied Egypt's concerns, then Egypt should not be blamed if it was unable to join in any conclusions on this important issue for the Third Ministerial Conference. This was a genuine concern because it was an important issue.","WTCOMTDM21.pdf","Egypt, Egypt, Members, UNCTAD, ITC, ITU, United, Nations, Commission, UNCITRAL, WIPO, Egypt, General, Council, Committee, Committee, Committee, Secretariat, UNCTAD, Egypt, Egypt"

His delegation suggested that the Chairman suspend and not conclude the meeting, and in the intervening period conduct informal consultations on the application of S&D provisions and on electronic commerce, in order to enable the Committee to reach conclusions on what was required of the Secretariat.

The representative of the European Communities (Netherlands) announced the administrative arrangement between Netherlands and the WTO Secretariat to establish a WTO Programme for Trainees from developing countries.

Trainees would not take up regular staff posts, but would be considered as WTO staff members during their assignment and would receive a normal salary. The content and duration of the assignment would depend on the circumstances and qualifications of each candidate. Normally, a traineeship would be for a minimum period of 1 year, and would not exceed a maximum period of 2 years. In order to enhance the basic objective of strengthening institutional capacity in developing countries, trainees must return at the end of their assignment. They would not be able to assume any other WTO post during a period of at least three years after their assignment.","WTCOMTDM21.pdf","WTO, WTO, WTO"
"1447",1447,"6","6.       He proposed that the Committee should move to a new more analytical stage of its work, and proceed to a real evaluation of the S&D provisions. The evaluation should aim at three objectives. First, the Committee, with the assistance of the Secretariat, should assess the difficulties encountered by developing, least-developed and developed countries in the implementation of the S&D provisions. Second, the real impact and the real implications of these provisions on the trade and economies of developing countries should be evaluated to determine whether the expectations held at the time the provisions had been adopted had been met. Third, there should be an assessment of the concept of S&D, the extent to which the concept had been well established, its relevance, and any scope for improvement in the light of rapid changes in the structure of international trade relations. If the concept was no longer relevant, then the initial expectations would not be met and the risk of marginalization would increase. Evaluation was essential. Such evaluation could be conducted with Secretariat proposals and with the assistance of other international organizations such as UNCTAD. In this regard, his delegation recalled, as an instructive example, the joint WTO/UNCTAD study on tariff peaks and tariff escalation.1","WTCOMTDM21.pdf","Committee, Committee, Secretariat, S&D, Secretariat, UNCTAD"
"1448",1448,"60","60.      The Netherlands would take care of all financial costs involved. The funds were separate from and in addition to the already existing Netherlands Trust Fund for technical assistance. Since this was the first time that the WTO was introducing a Trainee programme, the Secretariat and Netherlands had agreed to start with a modest number of 3 trainees per year, in order to keep things manageable and to learn from experience. After an initial period of 2 years the programme would be evaluated. In the coming weeks, the WTO Secretariat would establish the implementation modalities, in particular in the area of selection and recruitment, the development of tailor-made programmes and the supervision of the trainees.

The representative of Switzerland recalled that at the March meeting of the Committee on Trade and Development, the report by the Secretariat on Technical Cooperation and Training activities had given rise to an interesting debate. Several delegations stressed the importance of an evaluation of technical cooperation and training activities in response to the increased needs of developing countries and to ensure the effective implementation of the Uruguay Round Agreements. Furthermore, technical cooperation and training activities in the Secretariat had increased following the High-Level Meeting for Least-Developed Countries. It was important that technical assistance and training should achieve their objectives. She informed delegations that at informal consultations, her delegation had expressed its position that the matter of evaluation was an integral aspect of technical assistance. Evaluation was based on ex ante evaluation of objectives, on planning, and on follow-up of the activities. Accordingly, the Secretariat should have a mechanism for internal evaluation of technical assistance activities. Although the Secretariat already conducted such evaluation, a more systematic and elaborate methodology should be adopted.","WTCOMTDM21.pdf","Switzerland, Committee, on, Trade, and, Development, Secretariat, on, Technical, Cooperation, and, Training, Uruguay, Secretariat, Secretariat, Secretariat"

"1459",1459,"8","8.       The representative of India endorsed the statement and three proposals of the Moroccan delegation. His delegation drew attention to paragraph 5 of the Ministerial Declaration which referred to the work of the Committee, and the agreement of the Ministers on the need for effective implementation of S&D provisions. In this context, the proposal by Morocco was relevant and urgent. The Committee should move beyond factual studies as provided in WT/COMTD/W/35. To a large extent, it should be noted, that the S&D provisions built-in to WTO Agreements had not been implemented. His delegation felt that an analytic study prepared by the Secretariat with inputs from UNCTAD would assist the Committee on Trade and Development in responding to the concern in paragraph 2 of WT/COMTD/W/35 which stated that, "" .. the Secretariat has not found it possible to insert meaningful information on the implementation of the provisions: that is the case most particularly for provisions of a preambular nature, and for provisions that call on Members autonomously to take account of the trade interests of developing country Members in the course of implementing the WTO Agreements"". Against this background, his delegation proposed, as part of the exercise to be undertaken by the Secretariat, that developed country Members should provide the Committee with information on measures that they had taken autonomously to take account of the trade interests of developing country exports. His delegation also referred to the paper on tariff peaks and tariff escalation, prepared by the WTO and UNCTAD, as providing a good example of the kind of analytical paper that was needed. His delegation was of the view that the preambular language in WTO Agreements, including the preambular language from the WTO Agreement, were integral parts of the balance of rights and obligations of WTO Members, and his delegation supported the proposal         1           The Post-Uruguay Round Tariff Environment for Developing Country exports, UNCTAD/WTO Joint Study, (TDB/B/COM.1/14).

Some of the views already expressed, in particular those of Bangladesh and Tanzania, also reflected the views of his delegation. In addition, his delegation was interested in the theme of the paper for several reasons. First, the theme of the paper was welcome per se. The Agreement establishing the WTO was a major event in international economic relations. The increasing participation of a growing number of countries, including Nepal which was a least- developed country or small economy, and a land-locked country in the WTO, reflected the current geo-centric nature of international economic relations, but also a growing faith in the WTO and in its ability to ensure that even the small and the weak can secure a share in the benefits of the system and of the growth in international trade. Second, the factor of vulnerability was important . Vulnerability emanated from a number of factors, which were sufficiently important to deserve deeper study by the Committee and the WTO. The vulnerabilities arising either from internal structural weaknesses or from external factors, needed to be studied in depth. This was necessary to ensure that participants in the multilateral trading system should not be marginalized. For these reasons, it was necessary to consider practical steps that would ensure reversal of marginalization.","WTCOMTDm22.pdf","Nepal, Bangladesh, Tanzania, WTO, Nepal, WTO, WTO, Committee, WTO"

Comments would be preliminary since his delegation WT/COMTD/M/22 Page 22 had just received the paper. He emphasised several key points. First, Switzerland had always been concerned with the marginalization of countries and economies irrespective of size. His delegation believed that every effort should be made to avoid marginalization of countries. Addressing the problems of marginalization was a big challenge for the WTO and for trade-related technical cooperation. There was a problem with the definition of the group of small vulnerable economies, which was not self-evident. Furthermore, it was the firm belief of his delegation that the main elements of successful development lay in stable political and legal systems, within the framework of sound macro-and microeconomic policies. The experience of Switzerland itself was instructive. Switzerland was a small land-locked, net food importing country which had achieved positive results and considerable economic progress in 150 years of liberal industrial trade regime based on legal and political stability.","WTCOMTDm22.pdf","Switzerland, Switzerland, WTO, Switzerland, Switzerland"

He agreed with previous speakers that small economies faced certain characteristic problems, and had particular concerns, all of which needed to be addressed. In fact, these concerns were specifically recognized in the Marrakesh Declaration which embodied the special and differential treatment provisions, and also recognized the importance of the implementation of these provisions for least-developed countries. His delegation recalled that three and a half years later, the 2nd WTO Ministerial Conference in paragraph 6 of its Declaration recognized the importance of addressing the problem of marginalization of certain small economies, in the context of increasing globalization.","WTCOMTDm22.pdf","India, WTO"
"1472",1472,"104","104.    The representative of India noted that specific suggestions and possible indicators had been proposed in the circulated paper. His delegation would require time to study these suggestions and indicators. However, it was necessary to highlight the acute problem of increased vulnerability of small economies to the vagaries of global financial and economic conditions. This had acquired greater seriousness in the light of problems being faced by certain economies which were not necessarily ""small"". It was, therefore, necessary to recognize the seriousness of the problem of vulnerability, to address the problem and examine how it could be reduced or solved. In this context, it would also be necessary to study and find solutions to how those specific problems and characteristics that limit development could be overcome.

In this context, he commended the representative of Tanzania for his statement. The representatives of Jamaica and Barbados had made similarly useful and constructive comments. Second, concerns had been raised about the use of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) as a measure of the development of economies. His delegation noted that the Commonwealth and the World Bank had agreed to examine any difficulties that may arise for small economies in accessing funding for development, based on the use of the GDP as a measure for development. Third, his delegation expressed its gratitude to Members of the Committee for the interest they had demonstrated in their interventions on this item. Fourth, his delegation and other co-sponsors intended to submit further ideas to reinforce the jointly circulated paper. This position had been underscored by Jamaica and Guatemala. His delegation was convinced that further ideas would assist constructive discussions at the next meeting of the Committee. Finally, the representative of Mauritius referred to the suggestion raised by the representative of Tanzania on how to give effect to the decision by WTO Ministers. His delegation agreed that practical solutions were required. In this connection, he requested Members to consider what practical solutions and steps could be taken to address the problems and concerns of small economies. These practical solutions and steps would have to be presented to the 3rd Ministerial Conference through the General Council.","WTCOMTDm22.pdf","Mauritius, LDCs, Tanzania, Jamaica, Barbados, World, Bank, Members, Committee, Jamaica, Guatemala, Committee, Mauritius, Tanzania, WTO, Members, General, Council"

Views were being expressed that perhaps funding for technical cooperation and training activities would be better made through the regular budget, rather than the continuation with the current system of ad hoc Trust Funds. His delegation commended the developed country Members who were contributing to the various Trust Funds.

"1486",1486,"117","117.     UNCTAD had a long experience in assisting countries with trade facilitation. In this connection, it had developed various systems and programmes with real and positive impacts for countries over the years. These programmes were as follows: (a) Facilitation Programme (FALPRO): This was jointly developed between UNCTAD and the UNECE. This programme had recommendations currently in application in several countries; (b) TrainforTrade and TrainMar: These were both training programmes. The former focused on training for trade negotiations, and the latter focused on the maritime transport industry; (c) Automated System for Customs Data Entry and Management (ASYCUDA): This was software package to assist Customs administrations in countries. It was a part of a wider programme on Customs Reform and Modernization, developed within the World Customs Organization (WCO), and was supported by a number of international organizations such as the World Bank, the IMF, and the European Commission. ASYCUDA had been implemented in more than 70 countries; (d) Advance Cargo Information System (ACIS): This was logistic and a cargo tracking system, composed of several modules on ports, railways, roads, and a backbone that linked these modules. ACIS had been implemented in 15 countries, and was supported by several railway administrations, ports authorities and international donor institutions; (e) Global Trade Point Network (GTPnet): This system was developed within UNCTAD. Trade Points are focal points for practical trade transactions. They are points within a country where traders, both importers and exporters, can find commercial information. Trade Points are currently operational in 44 countries, and more are in the process of joining the system. These Trade Points had the opportunity to connect to Electronic Trade Opportunities (ETO). ETOs allow traders access to global information on potential trade opportunities. Currently, there are about 10,000 subscribers to this system which, at present, offered approximately 1,000 ETOs every week; and, (f) Transit Agreements: UNCTAD had concluded such Transit Agreements with several countries.","WTCOMTDm22.pdf","UNCTAD, UNCTAD, Automated, System, for, Customs, Data, Entry, and, Management, Customs, Customs, Reform, World, Customs, Organization, WCO, World, Bank, IMF, European, Commission, ASYCUDA, Global, Trade, Point, Network, UNCTAD, UNCTAD"

In this regard, the mechanism of a National Trade Facilitation Committee or sometimes referred to as the National Trade Facilitation and Transport Committee (NTTFC) was of indispensable value. Within this mechanism, all the key parties and interests in international trade were brought together. These included the public and private sector, as well as users and providers of services. Some of the specific interests, agencies, government departments and ministries which had tended to participate in this forum in some countries were the ministries of trade, finance, transport, national planning, transport operators, banks, insurance companies, customs, etc. At this forum, these interests examined proposals and searched for consensus between commercial parties and governmental authorities on facilitation measures to improve international trade and transport.","WTCOMTDm22.pdf","UNCTAD, National, Trade, Facilitation, Committee, National, Trade, Facilitation, and, Transport, Committee"
"1488",1488,"119","119.      UNCTAD had reached several conclusions. First, there was a need for WTO rules on trade facilitation.

Second, cooperation was needed. UNCTAD was ready and willing to cooperate with WTO in the field of technical cooperation for the implementation of any new rule on trade facilitation, particularly in those areas where rules had been recommended by the UNECE, UNCTAD, and in the area of the set of rules recommended by the UNISTE – United Nations International Symposium on Trade Efficiency at Columbus, Ohio, in 1994. He elaborated on some of the recommendations, from the meeting in Columbus which, in the view of UNCTAD, could be the basis for further discussion for rules in trade facilitation.           These were:   (a) UNISTE Recommendation 14, dealing with facilitation at the national level; (b) UNISTE Recommendation 15, addressing administrative procedures and operations in various areas; and (c) UNISTE Recommendation 16, emphasising the desirability for governments acting commercially, meeting user needs, using standard commercial documents, using Electronic Data Interchange (EDI), and employing commercial best practices.","WTCOMTDm22.pdf","UNCTAD, WTO, UNCTAD, WTO, UNCTAD, UNISTE, United, Nations, Columbus, Ohio, Columbus, UNCTAD, Electronic, Data, Interchange"

The Secretariat was encouraged to pursue the paths it had suggested such as with regard to the use and ""empowerment"" of local and regional institutions, and the use of new technologies to increase productivity. However, the European Communities hoped that technical assistance would not suffer from increased demands made on the Secretariat to support other activities in the future. Her delegation did not see any conflicts in the activities in the Secretariat that would lead to a reduction of technical cooperation activities.","WTCOMTDm22.pdf","Secretariat, Secretariat, European, Communities, Secretariat, Secretariat"
"1490",1490,"120","120.     UNCTAD suggested three areas of possible WTO action. First, the WTO could recommend that its Members apply the UNISTE recommendations in general or in particular recommendations 14 to 16. Second, the WTO could require that its Members apply recommendations 14 to 16. Third, the WTO could establish the application of recommendations 14 to 16 as ""an entry requirement"". If this were so, the WTO Secretariat could take initial action to prepare action by Members. Member countries would then decide which action to take; and in this regard, UNCTAD could offer technical assistance to developing countries.","WTCOMTDm22.pdf","UNCTAD, WTO, WTO, Members, WTO, Members, WTO, WTO, Secretariat, Members, Member, UNCTAD"
"1491",1491,"121","121.      The representative of UNCTAD selected the transport sector as an example of how trade facilitation operated and could be promoted. In Chapter II of the UNISTE Recommendations, there were four sets of specific recommendations to: (i) commercial parties; (ii) government departments; (iii) intergovernmental organizations; and, (iv) on the implementation of suggested recommendations.         (i)      Recommendations to commercial parties: It was recommended that commercial                  parties should eliminate non-productive areas; improve managerial skills through                  training and career development; implement Trade Points; implement EDI-based                  modern practices, switch to new commercial practices, for example, INCOTERMS,1                  UCP 500 (documentary credit practices); increase capital base; and use NTTFCs;         (ii)     Recommendations to government departments:             It was recommended that                  government departments should modernize laws and regulations; promote National                  Facilitation Committees (NFCs), implement specific operational issues such as block                  trains, updating of banking and insurance practices; stimulate training; harmonize                  sub-regional regulatory policies; create sub-regional databases such as ACIS; and                  hold sub-regional NTTFC meetings;         (iii)    Recommendations to intergovernmental organizations: Intergovernmental                  organizations should offer advice to governments and commercial parties on such                  issues as measures to facilitate the introduction of multimodal transport – door to                  door transportation – modifications of organizational structures, creation of NFCs,                  and organization of awareness campaigns on the value of trade facilitation;         1           INCOTERMS are a set of internationally standardized contractual terms which were devised by the International Chamber of Commerce to allow seller and buyer in a transaction to share responsibilities as deemed appropriate. There are approximately 13 of these different terms that exist, for example, FOB, CIF, etc. These contractual terms need to be incorporated in each contract by means of reference. WT/COMTD/M/22 Page 26         (iv)    Implementation of suggested recommendations: To implement the recommendations,                 technical assistance had to be provided and monitored, awareness had to be created                 on multimodal transport issues; and cooperation had to be ensured amongst interested                 parties.","WTCOMTDm22.pdf","UNCTAD, National, Facilitation, Committees, NFCs, INCOTERMS, International, Chamber, of, Commerce"
"1492",1492,"122","122.      To conclude his presentation, the representative of UNCTAD argued that due to the diversity amongst countries, it was necessary in each country to begin by identifying the key issues in trade facilitation. In this connection, the NFCs were important as a fora for identifying issues, exchanging views and searching for solutions, as well as for raising awareness on trade facilitation-related issues. On the latter, UNCTAD was regularly organizing workshops and seminars on international trade and transport. These seminars provided an opportunity to exchange views with representatives of the public and private sectors. They also served to draw attention to the value of all interested parties meeting at a common forum such as the NFCs and exchanging views. Sometimes, it was difficult for some governments to understand the rationale for the establishment of an NFC, a forum where the government would sit around the same table with the private sector. In the transport sector, for example, several key issues had arisen at NFCs. These issues were grouped into three. First, legal issues under which sub-sets of other issues arose such as transport, banking and insurance. Second, the issue of commercial practice. Under this issue, other sub-issues arose namely INCOTERMS, the use of documentary credits, the problems of foreign exchange, the non-recognition of EDI in some countries as a tool of international trade, and the issue of professional associations which were not well structured and organized and not recognized as partners in international trade. Third, were the operational issues. These included the problem of how to properly operate different transport modes, terminals, preparation and training of road transport operators. There were also problems in the area of border crossing, problems with documentation, issues arising from the automatization of customs information, and the physical problems at customs, points of entry, and transit issues which block or impede the flow of goods. The latter was especially problematic for land-locked countries.","WTCOMTDm22.pdf","UNCTAD, NFCs, UNCTAD, NFCs, NFC, NFCs"
"1493",1493,"123","123.    Following the presentation by UNCTAD, the Chairman called for questions and comments from the floor, underscoring the importance of Members ideas on how the Committee would contribute to the informal discussions on trade facilitation in the CTG.","WTCOMTDm22.pdf","UNCTAD, Chairman, Members, Committee, CTG"
"1494",1494,"124","124.      The representative of Mexico considered the presentation by UNCTAD valuable. UNCTAD had worked on this area of trade facilitation since 1994. It had evolved a serious programme on trade facilitation. Nonetheless, acute problems were present in the area of trade facilitation. In the view of his delegation there were two major aspects to trade facilitation namely, the simplification of documentation and procedures involving foreign trade particularly as regards exports. He referred to the UNISTE recommendation No. 16 (government as a business), in the presentation by UNCTAD, and wanted to know whether it was appropriate to refer to the government as a business or rather as a trade facilitator of international business and trade. He also wanted to know whether the recommendations adopted in 1994 remained relevant in the light of rapid changes in the international trading environment.","WTCOMTDm22.pdf","Mexico, UNCTAD, UNCTAD, UNISTE, UNCTAD"
"1495",1495,"125","125.     He commented on INCOTERMS which were important between buyers and sellers in international trade. The question, however, was the extent to which governments could become involved in this specific aspect of INCOTERMS. Normally, it was the International Chambers of Commerce (ICC) or the International Trade Center (ITC) which updated INCOTERMS in order to make them consistent with the current situation in international trade.","WTCOMTDm22.pdf","International, Chambers, of, Commerce, ICC, International, Trade, Center, ITC"
"1496",1496,"126","126.    He then focused on the central issue of the ways in which the Committee could contribute to the Work Programme of the CTG on Trade Facilitation. In this connection, his delegation felt that electronic commerce was important and strongly connected and complementary to trade facilitation. Furthermore, an important aspect was the impact of electronic trade on SMEs in developing countries,                                                                                     WT/COMTD/M/22                                                                                            Page 27 as well as the effects of trade facilitation on the trade and economic prospects of developing countries. These aspects had to be emphasised appropriately.","WTCOMTDm22.pdf","Committee, Work, Programme, CTG"
"1497",1497,"127","127.   Finally, he asked UNCTAD how trade points functioned, what problems they confronted, and how their activities could be improved, particularly focusing on the developing countries?","WTCOMTDm22.pdf","UNCTAD"
"1498",1498,"128","128.    The representative of Egypt agreed that the presentation by UNCTAD was valuable. The area of trade facilitation was complex and multi-dimensional. The difficulty seen by his delegation in the consideration of this subject at the WTO was the fragmentation of the subject into different committees. This created difficulties for the Committee in playing a coherent role on the item although important development aspects existed on the subject of trade facilitation. What, therefore, was required was a Secretariat Note that would assist the Members in structuring their discussions on the subject. His delegation acknowledged that several delegations had presented papers such as the European Communities, Switzerland, Korea, Hong Kong, China, as well as the Secretariat. The problem, however, was one of fragmentation across several WTO bodies. The objective of his delegation was not to duplicate the discussions taking place in other WTO bodies, but for a Secretariat Note to assist Members in rationalizing and structuring their discussions, and hence in contributing to the Work Programme of the CTG.","WTCOMTDm22.pdf","Egypt, UNCTAD, WTO, Committee, Secretariat, Members, Switzerland, Korea, Hong, Kong, China, Secretariat, WTO, WTO, Secretariat, Members, Work, Programme, CTG"
"1499",1499,"129","129.      The representative of the European Communities expressed its conviction that the continued and vigorous promotion of trade facilitation, in all its aspect, was an indispensable element for any development policy. Indeed, trade facilitation and the establishment of rational procedures would lead to the reduction of excessive costs, rational allocation of resources and encouragement of trade and investment. These were tangible advantages for countries that followed the path of trade facilitation. Several speakers had expressed these advantages. These speakers included the Chambers of Commerce of Peru, Zimbabwe and the Customs Department of Chile. The latter had shown that through the re-organization of its services and techniques, it had obtained spectacular results in cost reduction and in the efficiency of its services. On this basis and on the basis of experience in this area, his delegation concluded that trade facilitation was a win-win situation. Furthermore, his delegation stressed that this win-win aspect should be reflected in the possible contributions by the Committee to the Work Programme of the CTG in advance of the latter's March 1999 meeting.","WTCOMTDm22.pdf","European, Communities, Chambers, of, Commerce, of, Peru, Zimbabwe, Customs, Department, Chile, Committee, Work, Programme, CTG"

The representative of the United Kingdom responded to the questions by the representative of Tanzania on the announced contribution of US$10 million for trade-related technical cooperation over the period April 1998 to March 2000. The money was to be spent not only at the WTO, but also at UNCTAD, at the International Trade Centre (ITC), and conceivably also on bilateral projects. Some projects had already been set up at the ITC and UNCTAD, but not yet at the WTO, although his delegation was in the process of finalizing an offer to the WTO; a pledge would be made to the WTO, possibly before the end of the year.","WTCOMTDm22.pdf","United, Kingdom, Tanzania, WTO, UNCTAD, International, Trade, Centre, ITC, ITC, UNCTAD, WTO, WTO, WTO"

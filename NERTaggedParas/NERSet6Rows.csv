The representative of Nigeria said that there seemed to be similarities between the proposal contained in document WT/COMTD/W/191 and the proposal that Barbados had introduced. He noted, however, that it was necessary to ensure that developing countries and LDCs had the capacity to participate in the proposed discussions.

While his delegation was open to further discussions on the remaining two proposals in that submission, in principle Nepal supported efforts to make the CTD's work more effective. He explained that, in his delegation's view, the three proposals in the submission were guided by the motivation to make the CTD function as the focal point for the coordination and consideration of development-related issues in the WTO. Members needed to gain a better understanding of what work the WTO was undertaking on development-related issues, and how this work could be made more effective. He went on to say that his delegation had taken note of the proposal contained in document WT/COMTD/W/191. As for the proposal contained in the informal paper introduced by Barbados, he said that it could be taken positively. He indicated that it would be useful if the proponents of the various submissions could identify the complementarities in the proposals.","WTCOMTDM87.pdf","Nepal, Members, Nepal, CTD, CTD, WTO, Members, WTO, Barbados"

Turning to the proposal by the SVEs, he said that it sought to ensure that time and attention was devoted to individual development issues faced by developing countries. The proponents believed that the proposed workshops would contribute significantly to strengthening the work of the CTD. First, the discussions would take into account different viewpoints and would look at the contribution to development of the issue under discussion. The flexible and open format would enable Members to benefit from experiences and studies, as well as from information on ongoing projects and initiatives relating to the topic being discussed. All information gained through the discussions would provide Members with valuable input that could be used by authorities in capitals to meet development needs. He also noted the comments made on the potential complementarities of the SVEs' proposal with the proposal contained in document WT/COMTD/W/191. Finally, he indicated the willingness of his delegation, and other delegations in the SVEs Group, to contribute to a meaningful outcome to MC9 which would strengthen the link between trade and development.","WTCOMTDM87.pdf","El, Salvador, Members, CTD, Members, Members, SVEs, Group"

The representative of South Africa said that the implementation of the proposals contained in document WT/COMTD/W/192 would contribute to operationalizing the mandate of the CTD as the focal point for development issues in the WTO. Turning to the SVEs' proposal, she said that it would be forwarded to her capital. As a preliminary comment, however, she indicated that the proposal seemed to represent a good basis for further work. With regard to the proposal contained in document WT/COMTD/W/191, she said that there were positive aspects to it. However, she also raised a number of questions. First, she queried whether the implementation of the proposal would help Members to enhance their development prospects or their participation in the multilateral trading system. She also wished to know what outcome the proponents envisaged from the country presentations. While the sharing of country experiences was useful, it did not differ much from the TPR exercise. Furthermore, country presentations would not take Members forward towards a concrete goal, and would not meet the MC8 mandate. In light of her comments, she suggested that further work was necessary on the proposal. Her delegation was open to consider merging relevant aspects of the various proposals.","WTCOMTDM87.pdf","South, Africa, CTD, WTO, Members, Members"

On the proposal contained in document WT/COMTD/W/191, he said that while his delegation was open to the sharing of country experiences, it was important for Members to not lose sight of the CTD's other important work.

The Committee could make a contribution by focusing on some clearly identified issues, and in this regard the proposal contained in document WT/COMTD/W/191 could add value. The SVEs' proposal demonstrated a similar interest to engage in topical discussions, which her delegation supported.

She believed that there was convergence on the idea of the sharing of country experiences in workshops on the margins of CTD meetings. The topics for discussion would need to be agreed to by Members. However, the objective was not for the status quo to be maintained. Rather, recommendations would need to be formulated. She suggested that Members should look at the challenges faced by developing countries in making trade work for development. While a discussion of S&D provisions could be incorporated in the workshops, such a discussion alone would not provide the full picture of the linkages between trade and development.","WTCOMTDM87.pdf","Pakistan, Members, Members"
"10015",10015,"62","62.      The representative of the United States reiterated his delegation's concerns with the second and third proposals contained in document WT/COMTD/W/192. With regard to the SVEs' proposal, he indicated that it would be reviewed in his capital. On this proposal, he said that his delegation supported the idea of having focused discussions on trade and development, but also had some specific questions. He firstly asked why the proposal suggested that workshops be held on an annual basis, rather than upon request. Second, he wished to know why discussions on a topic for a workshop needed to take place six months prior to the workshop. He also asked what prevented Members from putting their issues on the agenda of the CTD or its Dedicated Session. He next turned to the proposal contained in document WT/COMTD/W/191. His delegation believed that this was a helpful proposal. While it was clear that the contours would need to be worked out, his delegation appreciated that the proposal left Members with significant flexibility to discuss their individual experiences in using trade in the service of development. The proposal could also provide a useful platform for Members to gain valuable insights on the relationship between trade and development.","WTCOMTDM87.pdf","United, States, Members, CTD, Members, Members"

He noted that the SVEs' proposal mentioned that development-related issues were discussed in several WTO bodies. This was why the proponents of document WT/COMTD/W/192 had called for the preparation of a report by the CTD to reflect the WTO's work on development. He went on to say that his delegation wanted a concrete outcome for developing countries at MC9.

The paper was available to Members and to the public through the WTO's website. Since the workshop was open to the public, arrangements were being made for the participation of individuals who did not have an official WTO badge. A programme for the two-day event would soon be posted on the WTO's website.

Finally, she recalled that, at the 86th Session, Members had been informed that the delegation of Uruguay had submitted to the Secretariat a number of biennial reports from past years on measures taken by member countries of the LAIA under the 1980 Treaty of Montevideo. Some of these reports had been previously circulated as GATT or WTO documents, but it turned out that a few had not, as the Secretariat had not previously received them. In this context, she informed Members that the five reports that had not previously been circulated had now all been circulated in Spanish, and could be found in documents WT/COMTD/76, WT/COMTD/77, WT/COMTD/78, WT/COMTD/80 and WT/COMTD/81. Some of the translations of these documents had also been circulated, and the others would follow soon.        -       Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) notification of Customs Union – communication                from China, Egypt and India (WT/COMTD/W/175)","WTCOMTDM87.pdf","Members, Uruguay, Secretariat, LAIA, Montevideo, GATT, WTO, Secretariat, Members, Gulf, Cooperation, Council, GCC, Customs, Union, China, Egypt, India"

He appreciated that they were being taken up together. He said that he wished to clarify that his delegation had not requested the insertion of an agenda item, but rather to retain the sub-items, in keeping with past practice that an item was retained on the agenda until discussions were exhausted and Members decided by consensus to drop the item. He therefore requested the continued appearance of these sub-items on the CTD's agenda until Members addressed the issues arising from the dual notifications of the three RTAs under GATT Article XXIV and the Enabling Clause. His delegation hoped that, during the discussion at the present meeting, substantive engagement would be observed from those delegations that had so far avoided engaging on issues of serious concern to developing countries.","WTCOMTDM87.pdf","India, RTA, Members, CTD, Members, GATT"
"10032",10032,"78","78.     He went on to say that the GCC countries had in the past indicated that it was their prerogative to notify their Agreement under the Enabling Clause, since they were all developing countries. The TM for RTAs stated that the CRTA was the implementing body for RTAs notified under GATT Article XXIV, while the CTD was the implementing body for RTAs notified under the Enabling Clause. Since the GCC countries had requested a change in the notification status of their RTA from GATT Article XXIV to the Enabling Clause, their Agreement needed to be considered under the Enabling Clause. It was not appropriate for any Member to object to this or state that the Agreement was incorrectly notified. This was a matter which had obvious systemic implications. The delegations of China, Egypt and India had listed the issues in document WT/COMTD/W/175.","WTCOMTDM87.pdf","GCC, CRTA, GATT, CTD, GCC, RTA, GATT, Member, China, Egypt, India"

While it was true that the GCC Agreement was a customs union and the other two were not, it was important for Members to recall that the RTAs TM laid out the same procedures for customs unions as well for other RTAs. Furthermore, since all three RTAs had been ""dually notified"" under GATT Article XXIV and the Enabling Clause, none of them were covered by the existing procedures contained in the RTAs TM. He said that this was an important development issue which had serious implications for the participation of developing countries in the multilateral trading system. A lack of substantive engagement on the systemic and specific issues would undermine the role of the CTD as the focal point for development issues.

The sub-item had fulfilled its purpose of informing Members of the notification made, and needed be removed from the agenda. He regretted that this matter had taken up so much of the Committee’s time over the past few years. These were the types of issues that took time, resources, and attention away from other pressing development matters. The US had stated its position on this issue clearly and there was no need to rehash those points. It was hoped that the Committee could move forward constructively, recognizing that the GCC Customs Union was not an issue of dual notification. The GCC Customs Union had been incorrectly notified as an Enabling Clause Agreement. This had been subsequently corrected, and the Agreement was in the pipeline to be reviewed in the CRTA, in line with the procedures of the RTAs TM. The US considered this issue closed, and continued to request that the sub-item be removed from the CTD's agenda.","WTCOMTDM87.pdf","United, States, Members, Committee, US, Committee, GCC, Customs, Union, GCC, Customs, Union, CRTA, US, CTD"
"10039",10039,"84","84.      He added that the US had no quarrel with any developing country notifying a qualifying agreement under the Enabling Clause. However, this was not what the GCC Customs Union notification issue was about. The GCC Customs Union notification concerned a customs union, which made it different from non-customs union RTA notifications. With regard to the content of document WT/COMTD/W/175, his delegation had not seen any specific issues relating to the GCC Customs Union notification. The paper appeared to be seeking a systemic discussion of RTAs, particularly with regard to the issue of dual notifications. However, as had already been mentioned on many occasions, the GCC Customs Union notification was not a dual notification. In concluding, he once again expressed his hope that the Committee could move beyond this matter and focus on other areas of the CTD's work.","WTCOMTDM87.pdf","US, GCC, Customs, Union, GCC, Customs, Union, RTA, GCC, Customs, Union, GCC, Customs, Union, Committee, CTD"

He said that it was not his delegation's intention to prolong the present discussion. Rather, China was seeking a satisfactory solution that appropriately addressed its concerns. The joint submission by China, Egypt and India was designed to help Members enhance their understanding of the systemic and specific issues arising from the dual notification of the GCC Customs Union, with a view to facilitating an expeditious solution. In this regard, he said that it was firstly important that the rights of developing Members under the Enabling Clause be respected. The Enabling Clause was one of the effective tools for developing countries to better integrate into the multilateral trading system and to achieve their development goals. Paragraph 2(c) of the Enabling Clause was being increasingly used by developing countries to foster sound relationships and engage in trade liberalization with each other. This trend needed to be encouraged. Second, the central role of the CTD in development-related issues needed to maintained and strengthened. The GCC issue, which concerned the application of the Enabling Clause, was certainly within the competence of the CTD. While it might be necessary for the CTD to consult with other relevant bodies in the WTO, this did not mean that the matter should simply be passed on to these bodies.","WTCOMTDM87.pdf","China, India, Egypt, China, China, Egypt, India, Members, GCC, Customs, Union, Members, CTD, GCC, CTD, CTD, WTO"

The Chairperson said that she wished to provide Members with a brief update on the preferential trade arrangements (PTAs) that were to be considered in the CTD's Dedicated Sessions on PTAs. She firstly informed the Committee that, on 15 January 2013, the EU had notified its trade preferences for Pakistan under the TM for PTAs. The notification was circulated in document WT/COMTD/N/41. The Secretariat was in contact with the EU concerning the information needed for the preparation of the factual presentation on the PTA. Much of the required data were already with the Secretariat, so it appeared at the present time that the PTA could be considered in a Dedicated Session of the CTD broadly within the timelines indicated in the PTAs TM. With regard to the thee PTAs that had been previously notified under the TM - namely, PTAs being implemented by India, China, and Chinese Taipei - there had been no significant developments since the last report to the Committee. In particular, the full set of data required for the preparation of the factual presentations of the three PTAs had not yet been provided to the Secretariat. She urged the notifying Members to provide the required data as soon as possible.","WTCOMTDM87.pdf","Chairperson, Members, CTD, Committee, EU, Pakistan, Secretariat, EU, PTA, Secretariat, PTA, CTD, India, China, Taipei, Committee, Secretariat, Members"

The Chairperson said that an item concerning the Hong Kong Decision on duty-free and quota-free (DFQF) market access for LDCs had been on the CTD's agenda since early 2006. Under this item, delegations had provided information on the steps they were taking, or had already taken, to provide DFQF market access to LDCs. Written communications by some Members had also been considered. For the present meeting, a communication from Nepal, on behalf of the LDC Group, was reflected under this agenda item. She invited the representative of Nepal to introduce the communication, which was contained in document WT/COMTD/W/194.","WTCOMTDM87.pdf","Chairperson, Hong, Kong, LDCs, CTD, Members, Nepal, LDC, Group, Nepal"
"10053",10053,"97","97.     The representative of Nepal, on behalf of the LDC Group, recalled that, at the time when the WTO was established, Members had recognized the need for positive efforts designed to ensure that LDCs secured a proper share in the growth in international trade. To this end, Members had pledged to offer special support to LDCs. The Uruguay Round Decision on Measures in Favour of LDCs recognized the specific needs of this group of countries in the area of market access and identified preferential market access as an essential means for improving LDCs’ trading opportunities. The issue of DFQF market access for LDCs had been on the table since 1996 and had been recognized as a means of meaningfully integrating LDCs into the international trading                                           WT/COMTD/M/87                                                 - 16 - system. Ministers had expressed commitment to duty-free access at every WTO Ministerial Conference. As early as the 1997 High-Level meeting in Geneva, Members had indicated their intention to improve the access to their markets for LDCs' exports. In the UN Millennium Declaration of 2000, it had been agreed that a policy of DFQF access for LDCs' exports would be adopted. At the Doha Ministerial Conference in 2001, Members committed themselves to the objective of DFQF market access for products originating from LDCs and to take measures to ensure progressive improvements in LDCs' market access. At the Hong Kong Ministerial Conference in 2005, Members decided that developed countries and developing countries declaring themselves in a position to do so would provide DFQF market access for at least 97% of products originating from LDCs, defined at the tariff line level, by 2008 or no later than the start of the implementation period. Members also agreed to progressively achieve 100% DFQF market access.","WTCOMTDM87.pdf","Nepal, LDC, Group, WTO, Members, Members, Uruguay, LDCs, WTO, Geneva, Members, UN, Members, Hong, Kong, Ministerial, Conference, Members, Members"
"10054",10054,"98","98.     He went on to say that enhanced market access had been a continued call from the LDCs. Without easy market access, LDCs' trade volumes could not increase and their continued marginalization could not be reversed. They would not be able to achieve the minimum 7% of annual GDP growth, which was a target set to reach the graduation criteria by 2020. Given the continued concentration of LDCs' exports on a limited number of products, enhanced market access conditions became all the more significant. Such conditions would help to increase export earnings, and also provide better livelihood means for the poor. Since the launch of the Doha Round, progress had been made in the provision of DFQF market access. Most developed Members provided DFQF market access for 100%, or close to 100%, of LDCs' products and thus met the terms of the Hong Kong Decision. Progress had also been made with regard to the conditions accompanying GSP schemes, through which most DFQF preferences were granted to LDCs. In addition, a number of developing countries had announced DFQF market access of varying degrees to LDCs' products. However, as was acknowledged in the Istanbul Programme of Action adopted by the 4th UN Conference on LDCs in 2011, a full realization of the Hong Kong Decision had not been achieved. There was a need for the timely implementation of the Decision.","WTCOMTDM87.pdf","LDCs, Doha, Round, Members, Hong, Kong, GSP, Istanbul, Programme, UN, Conference, Hong, Kong"
"10055",10055,"99","99.     The Hong Kong Decision specified that Members were to notify the implementation of their DFQF schemes annually to the CTD. The CTD would annually review the steps taken to provide LDCs with DFQF market access and report to the General Council for appropriate action. The review of DFQF market access for LDCs was a standing item on the CTD's agenda. However, full and complete information was not available on the implementation of DFQF market access. This was why the LDC Group had circulated the communication under consideration. The Group requested developed Members, as well as those developing Members declaring themselves in a position to do so, to submit information on the latest line-by-line tariff treatment of LDCs' products at the next CTD meeting. Members were also requested to submit information on plans for implementing the DFQF Decision. In concluding, he requested that the communication under consideration remain on the agenda for the next meeting.","WTCOMTDM87.pdf","Hong, Kong, Members, CTD, CTD, LDCs, General, Council, LDCs, CTD, LDC, Group, Members, Members, CTD, Members"

He went on to say that building capacity in developing countries and continuing to financially support the WTO's TA programmes was especially important in light of the changes that were occurring in world trade. The global debate was increasingly moving away from one based on tariff reduction and market access to one based on non-tariff barriers, including trade facilitation issues, compliance with standards of various types, and services regulations. Developing country requests for TA reflected these changes and the WTO had to maintain enough flexibility to adjust its services to the changing needs of developing countries. In delivering on its TA mandate in 2012, the WTO had managed to expand where needed, condense where required, move into new areas, and establish a structure to better monitor and evaluate the design and delivery of TA. This had been done under some budget strain, given that traditional donors had had their budgets squeezed by the global crisis. However, the needs of developing countries for more sophisticated TA in different areas had increased as a result of the same crisis. While this had meant some rationalization in the way that the WTO delivered TA, it had had no adverse effect on the quality of the services that were offered. In fact, it had led to a more robust and transparent system at both the input and output streams.","WTCOMTDM88.pdf","WTO, WTO, WTO, WTO"

"10074",10074,"104","104.    One main outcome of the workshop was the interplay of e-commerce with customs clearance issues, trade facilitation and Aid for Trade. Also highlighted was the need for an increased awareness by governments in developing and least-developed countries to learn more about the challenges and opportunities posed by e-commerce, and especially the important role e-commerce played in assisting SMEs gain access to domestic and international markets. It was clear that a main focus of current and future work had to be on assisting the ""least-connected countries"". Presenters and participants had also helped increase awareness of the variety of tools which existed on the internet - many of them free of cost - and which could greatly assist entrepreneurs and SMEs in bringing their businesses online.","WTCOMTDM88.pdf","SMEs"

Infrastructure problems were a major hurdle and much time was spent during the workshop discussing the need to upgrade power grids to counter the lack of regular electricity supply, difficulties with the physical distribution of products bought online and a general lack of electronic payment systems in developing countries. Another key handicap in many countries in Asia, Africa and Latin America was the lack of a reliable access to broadband, high speed cables. A further message from the workshop was the need for an entrepreneurial spirit when it came to overcoming the challenges posed by e-commerce. The refrain ""Where there are problems, there are opportunities"" was heard several times by private sector presenters keen on convincing reluctant government officials of the benefits of using e-commerce to help stimulate the sale of online food products, fish or handicrafts by poor, rural villagers.","WTCOMTDM88.pdf","Asia, Africa, Latin, America"

On the way forward, the CTD's activities under the Work Programme on E-Commerce - and in particular the outcomes of the workshop - would need be reported to the General Council, as specified in the Ministerial Decision of 2011. In keeping with the Decision, she said that she would make an oral report on her own responsibility on the CTD's work on e-commerce at the General Council meeting of 24 July 2013. She also noted that the CTD's activities, as well as the activities of the other WTO bodies implementing the Work Programme on E-commerce, would feed into the process leading to MC9. In this regard, she believed that the outcomes of the Workshop on ""E-Commerce, Development and SMEs"" provided some interesting possibilities for future work in the CTD, which Members would need to define.","WTCOMTDM88.pdf","Committee, CTD, Chairperson, Members, Work, Programme, CTD, Work, Programme, General, Council, CTD, General, Council, CTD, WTO, Work, Programme, CTD, Members"

At the level of inputs, a multi-layered architecture of training modules had been created and the Secretariat had increasingly moved to the delivery of e-learning - a move that had allowed an exponential increase in the reach and depth of training at marginal additional costs. At the output level, the RBM system allowed a more transparent assessment of the impact of TA delivery. The Annual Report on Technical Assistance and Training had evolved from an activity-centred one to include a results-focused monitoring report. For the first time, a Logframe had been developed which encapsulated the outcomes and outputs to be achieved, as well as the indicators and baselines to assist in measuring progress. As more data was collected to measure against the                                          WT/COMTD/M/88                                                -4- baseline objectives, the Secretariat would have a clearer picture of where the greatest impact was being felt and where improvements could be made. A TA Monitoring and Evaluation team had been established within the Institute for Training and Technical Cooperation (ITTC) to consolidate the monitoring and evaluation skills and capacity of the Secretariat and ensure a sustained focus on results. This would be an important tool for both donors and beneficiaries.","WTCOMTDM88.pdf","Secretariat, RBM, Secretariat, Institute, for, Training, and, Technical, Cooperation, Secretariat"

She went on to say that for a number of RTAs - namely, RTAs between India and Nepal, India and Afghanistan and India and Bhutan – the full set of data needed to complete the factual presentations had not been submitted by the parties. The Secretariat was also still waiting to receive some data relating to the accession of Rwanda and Burundi to the Protocol on the Establishment of the East African Community Customs Union. She urged the parties to these Agreements to provide the data as soon as possible. Finally, she said that that there remained one RTA notified under the Enabling Clause that had not been ratified by all the parties. This was the Pacific Island Countries Trade Agreement (PICTA).

Thousands of officials had gained valuable knowledge and skills that had enabled them to carry out their roles more effectively. This assistance continued to evolve. In 2012 and 2013 several new e-learning courses and training materials had been introduced. Technological advancement and access to information technology tools had allowed the WTO to widen its net in the area of e-learning, which he considered to be the most important TA innovation during his term as Director-General. The organization's e-learning strategy, introduced in 2012, had further contributed to the expansion of e-learning as the training tool for the 21st century. The new e-learning platform would allow an even greater number of simultaneous users and an enhanced level of interaction with and amongst participants using a variety of innovations such as simulation exercises and video conference applications. The investment in e-learning and the e-campus had led to a number of positive results. For example, the number of e-learning courses had increased from one in 2005 to 14 in 2013. In 2005 there were approximately 250 enrolled participants, while in 2012 the figure had increased to almost 5,000. By the end of 2012, the Secretariat had provided access to e-learning to over 20,000 participants.","WTCOMTDM88.pdf","WTO, WTO, Director-General, Secretariat"

Some amendments had been introduced on 1 January 2008, when the provision establishing duty-free and quota-free (DFQF) market access to the Norwegian market for all goods from LDCs was extended to include 14 low-income countries (LICs) with a population of less than 75 million.","WTCOMTDM88.pdf","Norway, Norway, GSP"
"10099",10099,"127","127.    She went on to say that Norway had made several more improvements to its GSP scheme with effect from 1 January 2013. In terms of the background to these changes, she said that in 2011 the Norwegian Institute of International Affairs had carried out a study of Norway’s GSP scheme. In the first half of 2012, an inter-ministerial working group made its recommendations regarding a revised GSP scheme. These were endorsed by the Government, and the Parliament made the necessary decisions as part of the State Budget for 2013. The most extensive change under the recent revision was to establish a new category of GSP beneficiaries. The new category of beneficiaries, which were lower-middle income countries and territories (LMICs) with a population of less than 75 million, had been established on the basis of the OECD’s Development Assistance Committee (DAC) list of recipients of official development assistance (ODA). This category of beneficiaries was granted more preferential market access than ordinary GSP beneficiaries as part of a new sub-scheme called ""GSP+"". One of the intentions behind the establishment of the GSP+ group was to soften the transition for countries graduating from an income group which benefited from DFQF market access to an income group for which ordinary GSP preferences applied. She explained that the provision of DFQF market access through the ""GSP zero"" sub-scheme remained limited to LDCs, as well as to LICs with a population of less than 75 million.","WTCOMTDM88.pdf","Norway, Norwegian, Institute, of, International, Affairs, Norway, Parliament, State, Budget, GSP, OECD, Development, Assistance, Committee, ODA, GSP, GSP"
"10100",10100,"128","128.    The benefits of GSP+ included duty-free access for all industrial goods. In addition, improvements in tariff preferences for agricultural goods had been made, including duty-free access for an additional 49 tariff lines and a 50% reduction on 15 tariff lines. Improvements had also been made to the ordinary GSP scheme, which benefitted upper-middle income countries and LMICs with a population exceeding 75 million. As part of these improvements, preferences on administratively reduced tariffs on cereals and soy bean oil cakes for animal feed had been increased from 10% to 20%. In addition, duty-free access was offered on fish oil for animal feed                                         WT/COMTD/M/88                                               - 20 - and a duty-free quota for molasses had been established.

"10101",10101,"129","129.    The list of GSP beneficiaries would continue to be based on the DAC list of ODA recipients, though beneficiary countries entering into a free trade agreement with Norway would be withdrawn from GSP preferences. Clear routines for dealing with changes to the DAC list had been established. In particular, in the case of a country that graduated to a higher income group, the preferences that applied to the higher income group would take effect at the beginning of the year after the country had been placed in a higher income group in two successive DAC revisions. Countries that moved to a lower income group would be granted the same preferences as other countries in the lower income group from the beginning of the following year. In conclusion, she indicated that the Norwegian Government would continue to reach out to beneficiaries to allow them to better understand the functioning of the GSP scheme.","WTCOMTDM88.pdf","GSP, DAC, ODA, Norway, GSP, DAC"

Through e-learning the Secretariat had been able to better incorporate the Progressive Learning Strategy (PLS), which had brought a welcome reorganization of the WTO's TA products. Participants could register for different training levels - introductory, intermediate or advanced - depending on their familiarity with the subject. They could also choose a generalist or a specialist path, according to their professional needs. All these changes had been introduced with the purpose of making TA more relevant and useful and had enabled the Secretariat to encourage progressive and sustained capacity building for existing and new clients.","WTCOMTDM88.pdf","Secretariat, Progressive, Learning, Strategy, WTO, TA, Secretariat"

The representative of the European Union said that the EU's revised GSP scheme would enter into force on 1 January 2014, which was 14 months after the publication of the relevant EU Regulation. This gave ample time for countries and economic operators to adapt. He said that an analysis of the current GSP scheme had revealed that, while the scheme was working properly, it was apparent that the time had come to take stock of recent developments in international trade. Notably, a number of economies had successfully integrated into world trade, while others were still lagging behind. The revised GSP scheme therefore focused on those countries which needed GSP benefits the most, taking into consideration their financial, development and trade needs. The new scheme was more dynamic and would adapt to the changing needs of developing countries by using objective and clear economic and trade criteria. The revised scheme was also more predictable and stable.","WTCOMTDM88.pdf","European, Union, EU, GSP, EU, GSP"

However, the standard GSP and the GSP+ sub-scheme now had a validity of 10 years, instead of three. The EBA, which granted DFQF market access to the EU market for all products from LDCs apart from arms and ammunition, remained open-ended. The GSP's potential for the support of sustainable development has been strengthened by the revision. The GSP+ was now more generous with countries which ratified and effectively implemented international conventions in the fields of human rights, core labour standards, sustainable development and good governance. The GSP+ monitoring mechanism had been enhanced and clarified, so as to allow a better understanding of how the effective implementation of these conventions could be ensured. More countries could also apply for the GSP+, and could do so at any time.","WTCOMTDM88.pdf","GSP, EBA, GSP, GSP, EBA, EU, GSP, GSP, GSP, GSP"

The revised scheme also improved the transparency of procedures, making it easier for economic operators and beneficiary countries to make use of the system and understand its mechanisms. This was particularly true for withdrawal and safeguards procedures, which would not change much in substance but were now more clearly detailed. The revision had been done in full and continued accordance with WTO requirements.

In 2012, LDCs were invited to more than half of all the organized activities and to three quarters of the activities organized in Geneva. Another priority was to increase the participation of women in the activities. In 2012, 45% of the participants - both in traditional activities and in e-learning modules - were women. The challenge was to continue to increase that figure and achieve greater gender parity in specific regions such as in Africa and in the Middle East. Africa, which remained a priority region for trade-related capacity building in 2012, had benefited from the greatest number of activities and from the largest part of the budget. When looked at from the broader perspective of the institutional building led by the EIF and the private sector capacity upgrade supported by the ITC in Africa, it was clear that the WTO was delivering for those Members that required it the most.","WTCOMTDM88.pdf","WTO, LDCs, Geneva, Africa, Middle, East, Africa, EIF, ITC, Africa, WTO, Members"

He drew particular attention to the data concerning imports by duty scheme that could be viewed from the Database. He explained that the provision of this type of data, which was now a requirement under the PTA TM for Members implementing PTAs, allowed a calculation of the utilization of each PTA by beneficiaries.

He explained that partnerships allowed a pooling of increasingly scarce resources, as well as a combination and blend of expertise, experience and focus. Partnership was the WTO's path to better understanding on-the-ground needs and ensuring that TA would have the greatest efficacy. In 2012 about 30% of all TA activities had been implemented jointly with one or more partners and close to 10% had been co-funded. The ITTC had entered into nearly 20 formal agreements. Partnerships, which had been expanded to include collaboration with regional development banks and regional secretariats, allowed the ITTC to do more with less. The WTO Chairs' programme, which was a partnership with academia, had recently been extended for an additional four-year period. He additionally emphasized the focus on results, interaction and ownership in the WTO-supported European Law Students' Association (ELSA) Moot Court Competition, and also mentioned that the re-launch in 2010 of the strategy for the WTO Reference Centres Programme had led to concrete dividends.","WTCOMTDM88.pdf","WTO, ITTC, ITTC, WTO, WTO-supported, European, Law, Students, ', Association, ELSA, WTO, Reference, Centres, Programme"

In light of the suggestion, the LDC Group had requested the Secretariat to provide detailed information on the line-by-line tariff treatment in LDC-specific preferential schemes, and on any dutiable tariff lines and existing quotas. The Group had also requested information on the value of imports under LDC-specific preferential schemes, as well as the value of imports under dutiable tariff lines. He expressed appreciation to the Secretariat for having provided the requested information and indicated that the information could be shared with interested Members. The information received showed that all developed countries, with one exception, granted full or close to full DFQF market access to LDC products, thus fulfilling the terms of the Hong Kong Decision. In the case of one developed country, the DFQF coverage under its GSP scheme stood at 82.5%, which did not satisfy the Hong Kong Decision. At present, DFQF market access was being considered in the context of deliverables for MC9, at which the LDC Group hoped to achieve a meaningful outcome on the matter.

Enhanced market access had been a continued call of the LDCs. Without easy market access, LDCs' trade volumes could not improve and their marginalization would not be reversed. Given the continued concentration of LDCs' exports on a limited number of products, enhanced market access conditions were of fundamental importance.

He said that, in implementing DFQF market access consistent with the Hong Kong Decision, it was important for the US to carefully consider the potential negative impact on other LDCs, including those LDCs that already had considerable access to the US market through preference programmes. The US had long held the view that LDCs and low-income countries were unique and that one size did not fit all. It had therefore tailored its preference programmes and technical assistance to target specific development needs. Any potential negative impact on LDC and developing country trading partners that already had access to the US market would need to be carefully weighed against the potential benefits to LDCs that did not currently have such access.","WTCOMTDM88.pdf","United, States, Secretariat, ITC, Hong, Kong, Decision, US, US, US, LDC, US, LDCs"

To enable expectations regarding the WTO's TA to be met, there was a need for secure funding. While the extra-budgetary funding requirements had remained at the same level for the last four years, contributions to the DDAGTF had started to decline since 2008. This meant a focus on doing more but with less.

There was a robust results-based framework in place and e-learning had increased the reach of the WTO's TA services. In addition, several interns were exposed every year to WTO issues. He said that a sign of the success of the WTO's TA was the clear message that he had received recently from the G-90, which had called for TA in new areas such as non-tariff barriers and trade finance. The G-90 had also called for a greater focus on following the progress of the participants in TA activities, for expanded e-learning and for increased internship opportunities. He added that, after the 4th Global Review of Aid for Trade held on 8-10 July 2013, he had heard calls for more exposure to value chain analysis and trade in value-added. In essence, the need was for a deepened and increasingly progressive and sophisticated approach to TA. He saw this as the greatest proof that the WTO had delivered on capacity building.        -    Annual Report on Technical Assistance and Training - 2012 (WT/COMTD/W/197)        -    Annual Report on Monitoring and Evaluation of Technical Assistance and Training -             2012 (WT/COMTD/W/199)","WTCOMTDM88.pdf","WTO, ITTC, WTO, WTO, WTO, WTO, Evaluation, of, Technical, Assistance, and, Training"

In introducing the Annual Report on Technical Assistance and Training for 2012, the Director of the ITTC said that the 2012 report was more analytical than was the case in previous years and provided Members with a better understanding of the rationale guiding the WTO's TA. In 2012, the Secretariat had continued to apply tight management of TA resources in order to maintain a stable volume of activities. Although slightly more activities were implemented than in 2011, there had been a reduction in resources relative to the previous year. She explained that in 2011 the DDAGTF had received contributions from 19 Members, while in 2012 only 14 Members had contributed. She added that the year 2012 had seen a slight increase in soft earmarking for specific programmes.","WTCOMTDM88.pdf","Director, ITTC, Members, WTO, Secretariat, Members, Members"

With regard to the PLS, she said that a rigorous selection process in 2012 had contributed to more homogenous groups of participants, making it easier to deliver the intended training at the planned level. The advanced level training offered was enriched with the organization of three new courses. She added that the introduction of the PLS had led to changes in TA activities in order to incorporate progressivity in the training offered. The effectiveness of these changes was, however, difficult to assess at the present time in the absence of clear benchmarks defining the substantive content of each training level on a subject-by-subject basis. Establishing such benchmarks was one of the ITTC's priorities going forward.","WTCOMTDM88.pdf","PLS, ITTC"

She highlighted in particular the new innovative course titled ""My Course"", which was based on a modular approach relating to the individual participant's needs. The French and Spanish versions of the new courses introduced in 2012 were currently under development and would be available in 2013. Turning to the regional trade policy courses (RTPCs), she said that these had been reformed in order to improve their cost efficiency. The cost of an RTPC, which was previously about Sw F 900,000, now averaged about Sw F 420,000. The coverage of RTPCs had also been extended to all regions. The planned RTPC for the Caribbean region could not, however, take place in 2012, and would instead be held in early 2014. In addition, there was no RTPC for French-speaking African countries in 2012, as a host partner was being selected. In 2013, partners would be selected for the RTPCs for English- speaking African countries and for the Latin American region.","WTCOMTDM88.pdf","RTPC, Caribbean"

For example, 44% of the WTO Reference Centres that were upgraded were for LDCs, and a specific course for LDCs had additionally been developed. Africa also continued to receive priority in TA delivery at both national and regional levels. She informed Members that e-learning had trained about 40% of the total number of participants, but at a cost of only 4% of the total.

Regional activities represented more than two thirds of the expenses across all regions. The bulk of the training was provided at the intermediate level. In terms of the language mix for face-to-face activities, English represented 60% of the activities, Spanish accounted for 20% and French for 15%. With regard to the gender mix, the Caribbean region had the highest number of female participants followed by the Central and Eastern Europe, Central Asia and the Caucus (CEECAC) region and Latin America.","WTCOMTDM88.pdf","LDCs, WTO, LDCs, Africa, Members, Caribbean, Eastern, Europe, Central, Asia, Latin, America"

He said that the introduction of RBM for TA activities had led to the establishment of a monitoring and evaluation team within the ITTC. The existing evaluation system was reviewed and some new elements were introduced in order to have a complete RBM monitoring and evaluation system, which was currently being implemented. The system would keep relying on a self-evaluation of immediate results by the trainers. Future reviews and ex-post evaluations of programmes to measure longer term results would have to be based on a deeper analysis of facts and would use key indicators of performance.","WTCOMTDM88.pdf","Head, ITTC, Evaluation, of, Technical, Assistance, ITTC"

Courses on sanitary and phytosanitary (SPS) measures and on trade and environment had traditionally been the most successful among the e-learning courses. For face-to-face TA activities, he said that the Secretariat was designing better performance indicators to help measure immediate results. A pilot on the use of a final exam in two RTPCs confirmed that more objective indicators could also be used, as had always been the case for e-learning. The mid-term review of the WTO Chairs Programme showed that this programme had been successful in stimulating academic activity on trade-related issues, but less so in monitoring the quality of the output and in reaching out to business communities or policy makers. Changes and improvements had been suggested at the last meeting of the Chairs Programme. A number of changes could also be noted since 2006 in the areas in which WTO TA had concentrated in Kenya and Senegal. However, these two pilot country reviews showed the difficulty of gathering enough precise data. Synergies with Trade Policy Reviews needed to be explored to overcome this challenge.","WTCOMTDM88.pdf","Secretariat, WTO, Chairs, Programme, Chairs, Programme, WTO, Kenya, Senegal, Trade, Policy, Reviews"

He highlighted the need to benchmark each of the three levels of progressive learning to ensure progressivity in the training activities. He also highlighted the need to improve needs assessments in order to ensure that TA activities were designed to better respond to the identified needs, while also promoting quality instead of quantity. Finally, he indicated that the WTO needed to continue to ensure that effective modes of delivery of TA were employed. In the coming years, the organization had to move from measuring outputs to measuring outcomes, with the full participation and support of the stakeholders.","WTCOMTDM88.pdf","WTO"

He noted the finding that e-learning was rated as the most effective form of TA, particularly in the areas of SPS and trade and environment. In this regard, he observed that while e-learning was effective at a certain level, it did not necessarily test for the application and implementation of a rule or regulation. He suggested that it could be useful to consider whether designing face-to-face trainings as follow-on to e-learning would help to measure impact more effectively. He also noted that participants conducted self-assessments of face-to-face training by answering questions such as, ""how effective was the training?"" or ""how well did the objectives meet your needs?"" His delegation encouraged the consideration of building in stronger criteria and measurements to determine if participants understood and knew how to apply what they had learned.","WTCOMTDM88.pdf","United, States, SPS"

Her delegation looked forward to continued cooperation with the ITTC in raising awareness and building capacity in Oman. Noting the high success rate of the e-learning programme, she said that in 2012 there were 28 Omanis out of 210 Arab participants who took part in e-learning courses. This increase in Omani participation relative to previous years was due to greater awareness among government officials, and possibly also to the fact that the e-learning courses were pre-requisites for participation in other WTO activities. While the increase in participation from Omani officials was a positive development, she noted that the Arab region was                                          WT/COMTD/M/88                                                 -7- under-represented in e-learning. The reports under consideration did not, however, mention the reasons for this under-representation or the challenges faced by the region. She suggested that some of the reasons could be related to limited access to technology and limited awareness, as well as the language factor.","WTCOMTDM88.pdf","Oman, ITTC, Oman, WTO"
"10144",10144,"27","27.      She went on to say that language would always put the Arab region at a disadvantage relative to other regions, whether in training or in negotiations. Ownership in the Arab region could never be achieved if TA was not conducted in Arabic. In this light, her delegation requested the Secretariat to introduce an Arabic e-learning course. By doing so, the number of participants from the Arab region would increase. Also because of the language factor, the Arab region faced challenges in finding participants for the RTPC. Her delegation requested the Secretariat to conduct a pilot country review in the region, similar to the ones that were conducted in Kenya and Senegal. The review could start with Oman, as well as with any other Arab country. Such a review would help to measure the longer-term results in individual countries and the areas where there was a need for further improvements.","WTCOMTDM88.pdf","TA, Secretariat, RTPC, Secretariat, Kenya, Senegal, Oman"

While they were all important, she said that she wished to make some points on a few of them. With regard to the recommendation for the Secretariat to focus on face-to-face activities in areas and content where value could be added, she said that the participation of regional organizations such as the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) or the League of Arab States would add value to regional activities. On the recommendation for the Secretariat to dedicate more resources to e-learning, she reiterated the importance of introducing an Arabic e-learning course. As for the future involvement of the WTO with the academic world, her delegation believed that the focus should not only be on teachers or professors.

He said that the LDC Group welcomed the efforts being made to make the WTO's TA activities more relevant and responsive to the needs of beneficiaries. He appreciated that new areas had been identified for various courses, including for the course on LDCs’ interests and priorities. Noting that the Secretariat acknowledged the importance of making courses more interactive, he inquired how this could be done, given that lectures dominated a large portion of the training time. On e-learning, he said that the subject coverage, outreach and interactivity needed be improved. In the meantime, he welcomed the recommendation for the Secretariat to focus on face-to-face activities where value could be added. He also supported the identification of common needs at national, regional and global levels so as to avoid a duplication of activities. Given that the objective of TA activities was to enhance participants’ knowledge and understanding, he additionally supported the introduction of new means of testing participants' knowledge at the end of face-to-face activities.","WTCOMTDM88.pdf","Nepal, LDC, Group, LDC, Group, WTO, Secretariat, Secretariat"

While the LDC Group appreciated the ITTC’s effort to ensure that results were delivered at less cost, it was nevertheless important to make additional resources available to address increased needs. The reports under consideration indicated that, while the overall number of activities in 2012 had remained broadly similar to the number implemented in 2011, there was a reduction in some areas. For example, the number of national activities was reduced by 13%. He suggested that it was not sufficient to simply attribute this to a decrease in demand without delving into the reasons behind the demand reduction. With regard to interns, he observed that the number of long-term interns from LDCs was lower in 2012 relative to 2011. He wished to know the reasons for this.","WTCOMTDM88.pdf","LDC, Group, ITTC"

He said that the African Group had recently had a fruitful discussion with the Secretariat on several matters relating to TA. While the African Group was satisfied with the TA provided by the WTO, the Group also believed that improvements could be made in terms of both quantity and quality. This could be achieved by more dialogue between the Secretariat and the African Group before the implementation of activities. The objectives of TA could only be fully achieved if the beneficiaries were consulted during the design phase so that their needs were addressed. He noted the benefits of e-learning and encouraged the ITTC to continue to enhance the e-learning programme. He also suggested that a one-week training programme each September for newly arrived delegates in Geneva would be useful.

He said that Australia currently had a multi-year funding agreement to provide $A 6 million to the DDAGTF. This was in addition to funding for trade facilitation needs assessments, for the ITC and for the EIF. A priority for Australia was to ensure that the WTO’s TA supported the participation of Members and Observers from the Pacific region in the multilateral trading system. The participation at a high level by Pacific Island delegations in the 4th Global Review of Aid for Trade reflected the level interest in the WTO and its work in the Pacific. The role of the internship programmes in helping to bring officials from the Pacific region to the WTO was also very welcome. Given the distance from Geneva and the high costs involved, the importance of the internship programmes for the Pacific islands could not be overemphasized. His delegation strongly encouraged the ITTC to continue to use the internship programmes to bring Pacific officials to Geneva. He also noted the importance of activities focused on LDCs and the need to continue supporting LDC participation in the multilateral trading system. Turning to the two reports under consideration, he said that the preliminary assessment of his delegation was that the more robust and thorough monitoring and evaluation was supporting Australia's own monitoring and evaluation through the Australian Agency for International Development.

This ensured a sense of ownership and accountability by all parties so as to achieve the targeted results. In this context, the ITTC had held a series of consultations with various regional groupings to gauge views on what activities would best address beneficiaries' priorities. The consultations were conducted on the basis of the replies that had been received to the TA questionnaire that the ITTC had sent to Members. The results of the consultations, which were contained in document JOB/TC/6, were discussed at a meeting with the G-90 held in June 2013.

The consultations had additionally brought out the need for the WTO to enhance or maintain cooperation with regional institutions and organizations in the delivery of TA and to increase engagement with other stakeholders such as academia, parliamentarians and the private sector. The Trade Policy Review process was identified as a tool that could be used for needs assessments and evaluations of the impact of TA. Appreciation was expressed for the PLS, with e-learning seen as the best tool to deliver introductory training and face-to-face activities perceived as being more effective for intermediate and advanced training. The consultations highlighted the need to continue to consider experience as an equivalent prerequisite for participation in WTO activities. It was suggested that equal importance be given to accession and post-accession activities.

The new TA Plan would also be different from previous ones, as it would focus on results. An assessment would be made on whether government officials were implementing WTO Agreements and making full use of Member's rights, whether beneficiary countries were complying with WTO accession processes and procedures, whether Members were accessing and using information enabling them to raise awareness of WTO matters with all their stakeholders, and whether educational institutions and the WTO-supported Chairs were applying WTO-related subjects in their courses and research.","WTCOMTDM88.pdf","WTO, Member, WTO, Members, WTO"

While this was particularly true at the national level, Members' needs would also guide the nature of the activities delivered at the regional level. There was, therefore, a need to move away from systematically offering regional seminars across all regions on every subject. While some of the traditional Geneva programmes such as the internship programmes and the Geneva-based courses would continue, some evolution would also be observed in this respect. For example, in response to the needs expressed by beneficiaries, it was envisaged that the content and structure of the Advanced Trade Policy Course would be modified. Overall, Members could expect a mix of traditional products and new products. Africa and the LDCs would, however, still be given priority in the overall TA programme. She added that Australia's comments concerning the Pacific region would also be taken into account. In concluding, she said that the Secretariat intended to submit the new TA Plan for Members' consideration at the last CTD meeting of the year.

The Director-General had noted that the element that tied these areas together was trade facilitation. The Secretary General of UNCTAD had highlighted the need for the ITC to continue promoting regional integration between developing countries and to focus on the link between export development, job creation and poverty reduction.

The Executive Director of the ITC had, in her statement, reviewed her seven-year term and the accomplishments of the organization in addressing the challenges identified in the 2005 Danish Evaluation. It was noted that the ITC had moved from an organization which delivered most of its work through small one-off projects to an organization which used large multi-year integrated programmes to increase the value and impact of TA. The ITC had developed internal procedures for improved project management and delivery, and tools to better respond to beneficiaries' needs. These changes had contributed to a greater level of trust through consolidated partnerships with donors and beneficiaries. The organization had delivered US$40 million in TA in 2012, in line with predictions made at the 2012 JAG meeting. The organization had remained committed to the most vulnerable countries, which benefitted from 69% of country-specific and region-specific delivery. While this represented a slight decrease relative to 2011, the proportion remained higher than in preceding years. The goal was to maintain or increase this high ratio of delivery to LDCs. The Executive Director had also highlighted the recent impact evaluation of the Ethical Fashion Initiative, the achievements of the ITC’s first generation of large programmes and the importance of the Women and Trade Programme. It was stressed that ITC had become a champion of women’s economic empowerment. In particular, the Global Platform for Action on Sourcing from Women Vendors had acted as a catalyst to generate opportunities for businesswomen in developing countries.","WTCOMTDM88.pdf","Director, ITC, ITC, ITC, Director, ITC, Women, and, Trade, Programme, ITC, Global, Platform, for, Action, on, Sourcing, Women, Vendors"

The Deputy Executive Director of the ITC had then given an overview of achievements and challenges in implementing the ITC’s corporate strategy, which was adopted by the JAG in 2012. Significant progress was reported in implementing RBM, in the establishment of a quality control architecture, and in the upcoming integration of the ITC’s resource mobilization strategy with a novel approach to needs assessment and project development. The Deputy Executive Director had noted that the first challenge was to regenerate the ITC’s pipeline of large programmes in order to maintain and increase the volume of delivery. The level of funding needed to sustain the ITC’s current level of performance was between US$40 million and US$45 million.","WTCOMTDM88.pdf","Director, ITC, ITC, RBM, ITC, Director, ITC, ITC"
"10168",10168,"49","49.     The Group had broadly welcomed the Annual Report for 2012 and had encouraged the ITC to continue building the export capacity of the private sector in developing countries and to support the integration of SMEs in global and regional value chains. The ITC was recognized as a model of good practice in RBM. Delegations took note of the ITC’s endeavour to progress on impact measurement methodologies for the next biennium and expressed support for the new processes that were being developed to improve needs assessments and to better integrate products and services across the organization. Support was also expressed for the ITC’s efforts to promote regional integration and intraregional trade, and for the organization's strong emphasis on non-tariff measures and on trade intelligence for LDCs. The ITC's Women and Trade focus was appreciated, as were efforts to further expand mainstreaming activities to promote an inclusive and sustainable model of development, focusing on poor communities, trade and the environment, and the empowerment of youth. Delegations confirmed the strategic importance of large, integrated programmes for the sustainability of the ITC’s impact-oriented strategy. There was a wide call for renewed support from donors for the next generation of large programmes. The ITC was asked to not forget the challenges faced by middle-income countries that had the potential to contribute significantly to South-South trade. Finally, on behalf of the Group, the JAG Chairperson                                         WT/COMTD/M/88                                               - 11 - thanked the governments of Australia, Canada, China, Denmark, Finland, Germany, Norway, Sweden and Switzerland for their expressions of financial support to the organization.","WTCOMTDM88.pdf","Group, ITC, ITC, ITC, ITC, ITC, ITC, ITC, Group, Chairperson, Australia, Canada, China, Denmark, Finland, Germany, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland"

The Chairperson recalled that, at the Eighth Ministerial Conference (MC8), Ministers had, inter alia, reaffirmed the link between trade and development and called on Members to fully operationalize the mandate of the CTD as a focal point for development work. The CTD had been directed to report the results of its work under the MC8 mandate to Ministers at the Ninth Session.","WTCOMTDM88.pdf","Chairperson, Members, CTD, CTD"
"10172",10172,"52","52.     She said that the MC8 mandate had been discussed at each of the formal CTD meetings since the beginning of 2012. In addition, several informal consultations had been convened to hear Members' views and suggestions on what specifically could be done by the CTD under this mandate. She recalled that she had particularly encouraged Members to consider submitting written proposals on concrete areas of work for the CTD, since written proposals were more conducive to a focused discussion and would also ensure a Member-driven process. Three submissions containing proposals for work under the MC8 mandate were currently under discussion in the CTD. One submission - by China, Cuba, Ecuador, India and the African Group - was contained in document WT/COMTD/W/192. Another submission - by Australia, Chile, Colombia and Singapore - was contained in document WT/COMTD/W/191. The third submission under consideration by the CTD was by Barbados, on behalf of the Group of Small, Vulnerable Economies (SVEs).","WTCOMTDM88.pdf","Members, CTD, Members, CTD, CTD, China, Cuba, Ecuador, India, Australia, Chile, Colombia, Singapore, CTD, Barbados, Group, of, Small"
"10173",10173,"53","53.      She went on to say that, at the 87th Session, the Committee had agreed to one of the proposals in document WT/COMTD/W/192. The proposal was for the Secretariat to prepare an update to its document on the implementation of special and differential treatment (S&D) provisions in the WTO Agreements and Decisions. The updated Secretariat note had been circulated in document WT/COMTD/W/196 and was the subject of the first sub-item for discussion under the present agenda item. She invited the Committee to address the first sub-item, after which Members could turn to the second sub-item which concerned the remaining proposals by Members.

"10174",10174,"54","54.     The Chairperson said that the Secretariat compilation contained in document WT/COMTD/W/196 was an update of document WT/COMTD/W/77/Rev.1 of 21 September 2001 on the ""Implementation of Special and Differential Treatment Provisions in WTO Agreements and Decisions"". It built on a previous update prepared for the Special Session of the CTD, which was contained in document TN/CTD/W/33 of 8 June 2010. The focus was on the implementation of S&D provisions in the WTO Agreements and Decisions.","WTCOMTDM88.pdf","Chairperson, Secretariat, WTO, CTD, WTO"
"10175",10175,"55","55.     Like its predecessor, the updated compilation listed each S&D provision in the WTO Agreements, and provided a space for comments, particularly with regard to the implementation of each provision. The S&D provisions in the WTO Agreements had been classified according to the typology developed by the Secretariat in 2001. This six-fold typology had been retained and included: (i) Provisions aimed at increasing the trade opportunities of developing country Members; (ii) Provisions under which WTO Members should safeguard the interests of developing country Members; (iii) Flexibility of commitments, of action, and use of policy instruments; (iv) Transitional time periods; (v) Technical assistance; and (vi) Provisions relating to LDC Members. A table in the Introduction of the document provided a numerical breakdown of S&D provisions by type and by Agreement. In addition, the update separately listed a number of Ministerial, General Council and other relevant Decisions that allowed for special treatment to developing countries and LDCs. Finally, she noted that the updated compilation identified the S&D provisions relating to which proposals had been made in the Work Programme on S&D under paragraph 44 of the Doha Ministerial Declaration.

The request in the first proposal had already been satisfied through the preparation of the updated Secretariat paper on the implementation of S&D provisions in the WTO Agreements and Decisions. Under the present sub-item, the Committee would continue its consideration of the second and third proposals in the submission. The second proposal was for the CTD to report on the development-related work of other WTO bodies and make recommendations to the General Council on achieving better coordination on development issues. The third proposal was for the CTD make a recommendation for parties to regional trade agreements (RTAs) to submit their notification and information requirements jointly.

He recalled the first paragraph of the CTD's terms of reference, which specified that the CTD served as a focal point for the consideration and coordination of development-related work in the WTO. He then recalled that Ministers at MC8 had called on Members to fully operationalize the mandate of the CTD as a focal point for development work. He explained that the second proposal in document WT/COMTD/W/192 was in direct response to the instructions from Ministers. Turning to the third proposal, he clarified that the proponents were not aiming to change any WTO rules through the proposal. He urged Members to consider the two remaining proposals positively.","WTCOMTDM88.pdf","Egypt, CTD, CTD, WTO, Members, CTD, WTO, Members"

"10185",10185,"64","64.     The representative of the United States said that he had comments on both the second and third proposals in document WT/COMTD/W/192. On the second proposal, he said that his delegation remained concerned about how it would operate and continued to question its impact. His delegation also shared the concerns voiced previously by other Members regarding difficulties in delineating development activities, given the broad range of work in WTO bodies. It was additionally unclear what specific problem needed to be addressed through recommendations to the General Council. While the US had previously requested the proponents to identify specific examples of problems they had encountered that would call for the proposal, no examples had yet been provided.","WTCOMTDM88.pdf","United, States, Members, WTO, General, Council, US"
"10186",10186,"65","65.     Given that the CTD already had the ability to make recommendations to the General Council, his delegation questioned the need for a proposal that directed the Committee to do so. Mandating the CTD to make recommendations would not bring Members any closer to finding ways of improving coordination. More importantly, the US did not understand what problem                                         WT/COMTD/M/88                                               - 13 - existed that would suggest that better coordination was necessary, as there did not appear to be a lack of coordination. The CTD already worked on issues addressed by other Committees. For example, the Annual Report on Technical Assistance and Training addressed TA needs related to Agreements covered by other Committees. While some Members claimed that the CTD was not informed on all development-related work taking place in the WTO, the US had difficulty understanding this concern given that the same Members were represented in other WTO bodies. In this light, his delegation saw no reason to mandate the CTD to report on all development- related activities.","WTCOMTDM88.pdf","CTD, General, Council, Committee, CTD, Members, US, CTD, Members, CTD, WTO, US, Members, WTO, CTD"
"10187",10187,"66","66.     With regard to the third proposal, he said that his delegation maintained its view that parties to an RTA should work together to the extent possible so that individual RTAs could be reviewed in a timely manner, thereby providing valuable information to the membership as a whole. His delegation had been very clear that it had no quarrel with any developing country notifying a qualifying agreement under the Enabling Clause. However, not all RTAs qualified under the Enabling Clause. Ultimately, it was up to individual Members to comply with WTO notification and reporting requirements, including those in the Transparency Mechanism (TM) for RTAs. Although the proposal was stated as a recommendation, in so much as it could be used to push all developing countries to notify their RTAs under the Enabling Clause, the US could not agree to it.","WTCOMTDM88.pdf","RTA, Members, WTO, US"
"10188",10188,"67","67.      He also indicated that the CTD was not the appropriate place to modify the RTAs TM. The RTAs TM outlined a procedure for both the CTD and the Committee on Regional Trade Agreements (CRTA), and the CTD therefore only implemented a piece of the Mechanism. Even though the CTD's implementation of the RTAs TM was only with regard to RTAs falling under paragraph 2(c) of the Enabling Clause, the proposal had a broader reach and would also affect RTAs notified under GATT Article XXIV. Since the RTAs TM was negotiated in the Negotiating Group on Rules (NGR), changes to the Mechanism would need to be agreed to in that body. Furthermore, the US continued to see this proposal as unnecessary. He explained that the vast majority of Members already notified their RTAs jointly and that there was no need for a recommendation suggesting that Members do so. The proposal would not provide a fix to the issues relating to dual notifications that had been discussed in the Committee.","WTCOMTDM88.pdf","CTD, CTD, Committee, CRTA, CTD, CTD, GATT, US, Members, Members, Committee"

She said that it was unnecessary and impracticable to give the CTD the mandate to report on the development-related activities of other WTO bodies and make recommendations to the General Council. It was unnecessary because the CTD already had a mandate to look into development issues and report where necessary. It was impracticable in light of the difficulties in delineating development issues from non-development issues. Furthermore, her delegation was concerned that implementing the proposal might interfere with the work of other WTO bodies, which would be counterproductive. Finally, she said that her delegation did not see how the proposal responded to the call from Ministers at MC8 for the CTD to undertake focused work, since it was a rather broad proposal.","WTCOMTDM88.pdf","European, Union, CTD, WTO, General, Council, CTD, WTO, CTD"

That being the case, she said that she wished to inform the Committee that she had met with a legal counsel in the Legal Affairs Division to discuss matters relating to the CTD's mandate.

However, what was lacking was a mechanism to operationalize the CTD's role as a focal point. This was what the second proposal in document WT/COMTD/W/192 addressed.

At the present time, the Committee was not provided with the information that would enable it to report on development-related work in the WTO. It was necessary for other WTO bodies to provide the relevant information to the CTD. While this had been done in specific cases, for example for the updated Secretariat paper on the implementation of S&D provisions in WTO Agreements and Decisions, it had never been done in a systematic way for the WTO's development-related work as a whole.","WTCOMTDM88.pdf","Egypt, US, CTD, Committee, WTO, WTO, CTD, Secretariat, WTO, WTO"

The proposal had the objective of avoiding such problems in the future with other RTAs. He added that the proposal did not specify that the CTD should work to resolve issues relating to dual notifications, even though the view of the proponents was that the CTD had the right to do so.

He explained that since becoming Director-General in 2005, and building on the initiatives of his predecessors, he had made all efforts to situate the trade-related capacity building of developing countries, especially the least-developed countries (LDCs), as one of the central pillars of the work of the WTO. He was confident that trade capacity building was now firmly embedded in the psyche of the organization.","WTCOMTDM88.pdf","Director-General, Committee, on, Budget, ,, Finance, and, Administration, WTO, ITC, Director-General, WTO"

However, Members had different views on the body in which such issues should be addressed. Furthermore, it would take time for a solution to be found. Until a solution was found, it was important to avoid similar problems arising with other RTAs. This was the rationale behind the third proposal in document WT/COMTD/W/192.

Several delegations had indicated their interest in the proposal.

He explained that a Member that wished to make a presentation would request that an item be included on the CTD's agenda, in accordance with existing rules and procedures. The informal document also laid out some indicative questions that a Member could draw on, including ""What is the role of trade in your development?"", ""What challenges do you face?"", ""What successes have been achieved?"" and ""What lessons would you identify for other Members?"". However, it would be for individual Members to decide the topic of their presentations, including with regard to any focus on a particular sector. He said that the proposal was intended to be modest, but would still add value to the work of the CTD. It was designed to maximize flexibility and minimize the burden on small delegations with capacity constraints. With regard to the relationship between the proposal under consideration and the proposal by Barbados on behalf of the SVEs, he said that the two proposals were distinct but could be complementary.","WTCOMTDM88.pdf","Australia, Member, CTD, Member, Members, Members, CTD, Barbados"

"10213",10213,"9","9.       The WTO's TA was a key contribution to strengthening the human and institutional capacity of Members to take full advantage of the rules-based multilateral trading system, to deal with emerging challenges and to enforce Members' rights and obligations. It was as much an ownership boosting mechanism as it was a capacity building one. Increased knowledge of the multilateral trading system increased that ownership. Increased ownership in turn clarified trade priorities and participation, while increased participation of developing countries in multilateral rule making improved the functioning of the multilateral trading system and strengthened its legitimacy. The implementation of the WTO's TA programme had made steady progress over the past eight years. In 2006, the first external evaluation of TA was conducted, the findings of which had inspired a number of improvements. Subsequently, in 2009, a new vision for TA was launched, with the objective of ensuring cumulative, progressive and sustainable capacity building and enhancing the efficiency and impact of the WTO's TA. He noted that the TA-related issues for discussion at the present meeting would cover how the WTO had delivered TA in the recent past, as well as how the Secretariat judged this delivery and what improvements it planned to make. In addition, the discussion would touch upon how the results-based management (RBM) framework and the discussions with Members were feeding into the crafting, programming and implementation of future TA activities.","WTCOMTDM88.pdf","WTO, Members, Members, WTO, WTO, WTO, Secretariat, Members"

The first strategic action was concerned with managing for results and ensuring full implementation of the results-based management (RBM) approach in an incremental and systematic way. The second strategic action was to ensure progression and accumulation of knowledge through the application of the Progressive Learning Strategy (PLS). In this regard, she informed the Committee that benchmarks would be introduced and that PLS levels had been allocated to activities where feasible. She said that the third strategic action was to promote the use of e-learning as the most cost-effective training method, while the fourth was to promote the use of partnerships to leverage resources and build on synergies. On the subject of e-learning, she recalled a request from Oman for the translation of e-learning courses into Arabic. She said that the Secretariat had recently met with the delegations of Egypt, Oman and Saudi Arabia on this matter, and it had been agreed that the Secretariat would explore the possibility of partners from the region translating the e-learning courses.

She recalled that it had been agreed at the 87th Session that the CTD's discussion under this agenda item would take place at the present meeting, based on a background paper prepared by the Secretariat.

"10240",10240,"103","103.    The Chief Statistician provided a broad summary of the information contained in the Secretariat paper. As part of his presentation, he indicated that the participation of developing economies in world trade had risen particularly fast during the 2000s, including during the 2008-2009 global economic crisis. In the lacklustre global economic context that prevailed in 2011 and 2012, developing economies' share in world trade had continued to rise. Their share in world exports of goods and commercial services stood at 41% in 2012, while their share of imports was 39%. Turning specifically to merchandise trade, he said that developing economies' exports accounted for 44% of the world total and their imports for 41%. South-South trade was one of the main driving forces of developing economies’ merchandise trade. In 2010, the share of South-South trade accounted for 50% of developing economies' exports and continued rising in 2011 and 2012. However, intra-developing Asian trade grew significantly less than other South- South trade flows. One reason for this was that developing Asian economies were strongly interconnected within GVCs that were sensitive to the drop in demand from developed markets. In 2013, developing economies' exports and imports were forecasted to grow by 3.8% and 5.8% respectively, while developed countries were expected to experience a 1.5% increase in exports and a 0.1% decrease in imports.","WTCOMTDM89.pdf","Secretariat, South-South"
"10241",10241,"104","104.    With regard to commercial services, the share of developing economies' trade was also rising, mainly due to developing Asia.

A total of Sw F 21.2 million was required, of which 21.4% would come from the regular budget and 10.7% from other trust funds. The remaining 67.9% needed to come from voluntary contributions. As of 30 September 2013, the Secretariat had received contributions for 2013 amounting to Sw F 4.6 million, which was less than what had been expected. However, it had still been possible to implement activities in 2013 due to a carry forward of Sw F 12.4 million from 2012. Since most of the contributions for 2013 had been received quite late in the year, a large proportion would be carried forward to 2014. She added that the outlook for 2014 was more positive than for 2013. Pledges from a number of traditional donors had been received, which                                          WT/COMTD/M/89                                                 -4- would be multi-year contributions. The fact that donors were making multi-year contributions made the receipt of funds more predictable. If this trend continued, it would be possible to fully implement all the planned activities for 2014.","WTCOMTDM89.pdf","Secretariat"

She recalled that, during the 26th Dedicated Session on 23 October, a workshop was held on the effects of non-tariff measures (NTMs) on the exports of small economies. In this light, the square brackets could be removed around the sentence in paragraph 4.2 which read: ""During the Workshop Members heard presentations on recent research conducted by NTMs by representatives from the ITC and UNCTAD"". She added that the 26th Dedicated Session would need to resume in order to adopt the Dedicated Session's report to the General Council.

The US requested that the sentence be deleted, given that the current Director-General had more recently laid out a different direction for Aid-for- Trade work.

The TM was being implemented by the CTD, as per the provisions contained in document WT/L/806, which was the General Council Decision of 14 December 2010 which established the Mechanism. Paragraph 26 of the TM indicated that the Mechanism would apply on a provisional basis until Members approved its permanent application. The paragraph also indicated that Members would review the Mechanism after three years and if necessary modify it in light of the experience gained from its provisional operation. She went on to say that, in December 2013, three years would have elapsed since the General Council Decision which established the TM. Members would, therefore, soon need to consider the question of the review of the Mechanism. Whether enough experience had been gained yet to conduct a review would also be for Members to determine. At the present time, she was bringing the matter to the Committee's attention. She informed the Committee that she intended to hold consultations with Members in the early part of 2014 to hear views concerning the timing and the nature of a review of the TM.","WTCOMTDM89.pdf","Chairperson, Members, CTD, General, Council, Decision, Members, Members, General, Council, Decision, Members, Members, Committee, Committee, Members"

The representative of Nepal, on behalf of the LDC Group, said that the WTO's TA activities were a core element of the development dimension of the multilateral trading system. He expressed appreciation to donors for the WTO's TA activities, which were helping LDCs to build capacity and enhance their understanding of WTO issues. Capacity-building activities at global, regional and national levels had all proved to be relevant and productive for government officials and others working on WTO issues. Both e-learning and face-to-face activities had been effective. He expressed appreciation to the ITTC for preparing the TA Plan for the 2014-2015 period in a demand-driven manner and for incorporating the RBM approach to TA management and delivery. He was encouraged to note that LDCs would receive priority in TA activities and that special attention would be given to LDCs in the process of accession. He went on to say that the timely and effective implementation of the Plan would depend on the availability of funding. In this context, he indicated that the shrinking number of donor countries and the decreases in contributions to the Doha Development Agenda Global Trust Fund were matters of serious concern to beneficiaries, and in particular LDCs. He urged donors to increase, or at least maintain, their level of support in order to ensure the smooth implementation of TA activities. He acknowledged that some improvements and interventions were needed at the level of the beneficiary countries in order to increase the effectiveness of TA, including through the involvement of various stakeholders. He also stressed the importance of monitoring and evaluating TA activities, and of ensuring transparency and accountability.","WTCOMTDM89.pdf","Nepal, LDC, Group, WTO, WTO, WTO, WTO, RBM, LDCs, Doha, Development, Agenda, Global, Trust, Fund, TA"

"10269",10269,"16","16.     The representative of China appreciated the consultations held by the ITTC. He recalled that, during the consultations, China had noted the evolving situation with regard to the TA Plan. There was firstly the financial constraint. The renewed momentum with respect to the Doha Round of negotiations in the run-up to MC9 was another factor. There was additionally a need for TA on newer issues, while demands for TA also arose from the accession process. He invited the Secretariat to be proactive in engaging donors and South-South partners in mobilizing new funds. He also encouraged the Secretariat to make room for a possible outcome at MC9, so that developing countries could have assistance in implementing the results. He indicated that China supported the PLS, but wished to see a more clear-cut formulation of programmes at different levels. He also expressed support for the WTO Chairs Programme. Finally, while noting the Secretariat's efforts to put in place the RBM approach, he observed that efforts to mobilize financial resources and provide demand-driven TA were equally important. 16.5% in 2000 to about a third in 2010. He next briefly introduced the Trade in Value Added                                           WT/COMTD/M/89                                                 - 15 - (TiVA) database, which had been released in January 2013 by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) and the WTO. Noting the growing importance of trade in intermediate goods within GVCs, he said that the database provided access to trade in value added indicators for 57 economies, 20 of which were developing economies. He observed that the value added approach to analyzing trade flows highlighted the significant role of services in world trade. For example, developing economies' exports of manufactures included close to 28% of value added from the services sector. Finally, he referred to the information on the domestic environment for trading across borders which was contained in the Annex to the Secretariat paper. He noted that, since 2010, developing economies had continued to reduce their delays for exporting and importing, by about one day on average. Although the gap was narrowing, developing economies' procedural requirements were still considerably longer than in developed countries. He highlighted the particular difficulties faced by LLDCs in this regard.","WTCOMTDM89.pdf","China, ITTC, China, Secretariat, South-South, Secretariat, China, WTO, Chairs, Programme, Secretariat, RBM, Organization, for, Economic, Cooperation, and, Development, OECD, WTO, Secretariat, LLDCs"

The representative of the United States said that his delegation recognized the participatory approach that had been taken in the preparation of the TA Plan and appreciated that the Plan remained rooted in beneficiaries' needs. He noted that documents of this type were necessarily summaries of several activities in many different countries. Given the limited detail, his delegation encouraged the WTO to continue to reach out to other donors and institutions in each country before implementing a project, so as to coordinate and link specific activities and assistance. The US understood and supported the greater emphasis on e-learning and blended learning, and recognized that donors and TA providers needed to keep websites light in order to facilitate access by those with limited facilities. Noting that the TA activities mainly targeted government officials, he indicated that it was equally important to organize outreach activities for various stakeholders and other donors. His delegation looked forward to monitoring the implementation of the Plan. Turning to the request for e-learning courses to be provided in Arabic, he indicated that his delegation was not in a position to support the request, particularly in light of the budgetary implications of translating courses into languages that were not official WTO languages.","WTCOMTDM89.pdf","United, States, WTO, US, WTO"

In addition, several informal consultations had been convened to hear Members' views and suggestions on what specifically could be done by the CTD under this mandate. She recalled that she had particularly encouraged Members to consider submitting written proposals on concrete areas of work for the CTD, since written proposals were more conducive to a focused discussion and would also ensure a Member-driven process. On the agenda for the present meeting were two submissions for work under the MC8 mandate which had been previously discussed by the Committee at both formal and informal meetings. One submission - by China, Cuba, Ecuador, India and the African Group - was contained in document WT/COMTD/W/192.

The CTD had been established to serve as a focal point for the consideration and coordination of work on development. More specifically, the CTD was to take responsibility for the review of the implementation of S&D provisions and the consideration of any issue raised in that regard. The minutes of CTD meetings held between April 1995 and early 2002 showed that this subject had been considered regularly in the Committee. Particular attention was paid to the review of the application of special provisions in the Multilateral Trade Agreements and related Ministerial Decisions in favour of developing country Members. After listing several Secretariat notes that had been prepared in the context of these discussions, he went on to say that, since 2002, the item concerning the review of S&D provisions had disappeared from the CTD's agenda. The Committee had tended to concentrate on matters relating to notifications and transparency. He suggested that the CTD commence a substantive discussion in 2014 on the basis of the information provided in document WT/COMTD/W/196.

The two remaining proposals had been discussed in the informal, open-ended meetings that she had convened on 19 September and 30 September 2013. One of the remaining proposals was for the CTD to make a recommendation for parties to regional trade agreements (RTAs) to submit their notification and information requirements jointly. The other remaining proposal was for a sentence to be added to document WT/L/105 - which was concerned with procedures for an annual overview of WTO activities and for reporting under the WTO - in order to instruct the CTD to report on development-related activities and issues raised in other WTO bodies.

She recalled that, in the informal CTD meeting that had been held on 19 September 2013, a representative of the Legal Affairs Division had shared the view that the CTD could report on development work in the WTO.

Turning to the Chairperson's reference to the discussion at the informal CTD meeting held on 19 September 2013, he said that he wished to clarify that there had been no indication from the representative of the Legal Affairs Division that the CTD was unable to fulfil its mandate from MC8.

"10329",10329,"70","70.      The representative of Paraguay, on behalf of the LLDC Group, said that the geographical situation of LLDCs distinguished them from other countries. In particular, LLDCs had no direct access to maritime ports and were far from major consumer markets. Higher transport costs and the resulting decrease in production profits had marginalized the LLDCs, which were highly dependent on international cooperation, particularly with their transit countries. International trade was an important means of boosting the development of LLDCs and was therefore an essential part of the agenda of this group of countries. At the present time, LLDCs' participation in international trade was limited. However, there was great potential for this to change, particularly if the LLDCs became focal points and hubs in their regions through greater participation in global value chains (GVCs). Consequently, the LLDCs were looking towards diversification, structural transformation and economic sustainability. In the Ministerial Communiqué under consideration, considerable emphasis had been placed on the work of the WTO. The LLDC Ministers had attached particular importance to the adoption of an Agreement on Trade Facilitation with binding commitments. The Ministers were also calling for a successful conclusion to the Doha Round. For progress to be made in the negotiations, it was important to achieve positive and concrete results at MC9. The Communiqué additionally highlighted the LLDCs' needs with respect to Aid for Trade. He indicated that the LLDC Group was currently preparing for a review of its work programme. The review would be conducted in the first half of 2014 and would lead to the adoption of a new plan for the coming decade. In this endeavour, the LLDCs hoped to benefit from support in the various forums that promoted their objectives.","WTCOMTDM89.pdf","Paraguay, LLDC, Group, LLDCs, LLDCs, LLDCs, LLDCs, LLDCs, LLDCs, Ministerial, Communiqué, WTO, LLDCs, LLDC, Group, LLDCs"

With regard to the India-ASEAN Agreement, she informed the Committee that the Secretariat was in the process of drafting the factual presentation, which would be sent shortly to the parties for comments. For a number of other RTAs - namely, RTAs between India and Nepal, India and Afghanistan, and India and Bhutan - the full set of data needed to complete the factual presentations had not been submitted by the parties. The Secretariat was also still waiting to receive some data relating to the accession of Rwanda and Burundi to the Protocol on the Establishment of the East African Community Customs Union. She urged the parties to these agreements to provide the data as soon as possible.","WTCOMTDM89.pdf","Chairperson, Members, CTD, Committee, Secretariat, India, Nepal, India, Afghanistan, India, Bhutan, Secretariat, Rwanda, Burundi, East, African, Community, Customs, Union"

This was the Pacific Island Countries Trade Agreement (PICTA). Following the procedures of the Committee on Regional Trade Agreements (CRTA), a factual presentation of an RTA falling in this category would only be drafted after the Agreement had been ratified by all the parties. The parties to PICTA were urged to inform the Secretariat as soon as all ratifications were complete. Finally, she informed Members that the delegation of Uruguay had submitted to the Secretariat a report concerning the Latin American Integration Association, which contained information on instruments signed under the 1980 Treaty of Montevideo in 2010 and 2011. The delegation of Uruguay had requested that the report be circulated to Members and placed on the CTD's agenda. In light of current workloads, it had not been possible to circulate the report before the present meeting. However, the original Spanish version of the report would be circulated soon, and the English and French translations would follow shortly thereafter. The report would be reflected on the agenda of the next meeting.         -   Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) notification of Customs Union – communication from             China, Egypt and India (WT/COMTD/W/175)","WTCOMTDM89.pdf","RTA, Pacific, Island, Committee, CRTA, RTA, Secretariat, Members, Uruguay, Secretariat, Latin, American, Integration, Association, Montevideo, Uruguay, Members, CTD, Gulf, Cooperation, Council, GCC, Customs, Union, China, Egypt, India"

His delegation had common concerns about the three notifications and he appreciated that they were being taken up together. He noted that in the past years, Members' discussions had largely focused on procedure. In an effort to promote constructive and substantive engagement, the delegations of China, Egypt and India had made a formal submission in September 2010 contained in document WT/COMTD/W/175, which highlighted a number of systemic and specific concerns. He regretted that some Members were not ready to engage substantively to resolve this matter. His delegation wished to keep the matter on the CTD's agenda for the next meeting, and until it was resolved.","WTCOMTDM89.pdf","India, RTA, Members, China, Egypt, India, Members, CTD"
"10337",10337,"78","78.      He went on to say that the matter was of critical importance for developing country Members. The systemic issues impinged on the Enabling Clause and the terms of reference of the CTD, as well as on the TM for RTAs. The specific concerns that had been highlighted emanated not only from suggestions by some Members regarding the consideration of the GCC Customs Union in a certain procedural way, but also from the notification, re-notification and withdrawal of notifications, as well as the efforts to deny developing countries the right to notify their RTAs under the Enabling Clause. His delegation wanted an early resolution of the matter so that the process of enhancing transparency in all RTAs could keep advancing. In its present form, the RTAs TM did not provide procedures for RTAs with a dual notification under GATT Article XXIV and the Enabling Clause. Given that some Members had refrained from holding substantive discussions on                                         WT/COMTD/M/89                                               - 12 - this matter, his delegation saw clear attempts to undermine the role of the CTD and to circumscribe the right of developing countries to notify their RTAs under the Enabling Clause. There was a need to resolve the matter at the earliest so that the flexibilities available to developing countries to better integrate into the multilateral trading system were not constrained.","WTCOMTDM89.pdf","Members, CTD, Members, GCC, Customs, Union, GATT, Members, CTD"

The Director of the ITTC said that the ITTC had held consultations with Members in April and May 2013 in order to establish technical assistance (TA) priority needs for 2014 and 2015. The new TA Plan had been prepared on the basis of these consultations and the lessons drawn from implementing previous TA Plans. The Plan therefore responded to identified national and regional needs and priorities, in addition to outlining the key targeted results. It also identified the strategic context in which the activities would be implemented, as well as the funding sources. As such, the Plan had been recast to incorporate the renewed emphasis on accountability, monitoring and evaluation, and contained a mix of traditional and new products. The main purpose was to enhance beneficiaries' capacity to benefit from the multilateral trading system and deal with emerging challenges. The specific areas of focus of national activities would be determined at the time a request was made through the online request form. A number of regional activities had been specifically identified based on needs and priorities, though some flexibility had also been built in to accommodate the changing needs of beneficiaries and to take into account a possible outcome at the Ninth Ministerial Conference (MC9).

This sub-item had fulfilled its purpose of informing Members of the notification made, and needed to be removed from the agenda. The GCC Customs Union had been incorrectly notified as an Enabling Clause Agreement. This had been subsequently corrected, and the GCC Customs Union was in the pipeline to be reviewed in the CRTA, in line with the procedures of the RTAs TM. The US considered this matter closed, and continued to request that it be removed from the CTD's agenda. The US wished to be very clear that it had no quarrel with any developing country notifying a qualifying Agreement under the Enabling Clause. However, this was not what the GCC Customs Union notification issue was about. The GCC Customs Union notification concerned a customs union, which made it different from non-customs union RTA notifications. With regard to the content of document WT/COMTD/W/175, his delegation had not seen any specific issues related to the GCC Customs Union notification. The paper appeared to be seeking a systemic discussion of RTAs, particularly with regard to the issue of dual notifications. Given that the GCC Customs Union had been incorrectly notified as an Enabling Clause Agreement, and that this was subsequently corrected by the notifying Members, the GCC notification was not a dual notification. His delegation had explained its arguments in detail in previous meetings and found it unfortunate to have to rehash those points.","WTCOMTDM89.pdf","United, States, Members, GCC, Customs, Union, GCC, Customs, Union, CRTA, US, CTD, US, GCC, Customs, Union, GCC, Customs, Union, RTA, GCC, Customs, Union, GCC, Customs, Union, Members, GCC"

He stressed that Australia had no argument with any developing country notifying a qualifying agreement under the Enabling Clause. His delegation also supported the proper implementation of the RTAs TM. While the communication from China, Egypt and India raised systemic issues relating to the implementation of the RTAs TM, it was not possible for a discussion on these issues to be held in the CTD, as the Committee was not the only body that had been tasked with the implementation of the Mechanism.","WTCOMTDM89.pdf","Australia, Australia, China, Egypt, India, CTD, Committee"

The second was that acceding governments would participate in accession negotiations, in line with WTO accession processes and procedures. The third was that Members would access and use WTO-related information to raise awareness of WTO matters with their stakeholders, while the fourth was that WTO-supported academic institutions would include trade policy and WTO-related topics in their courses and research. She said that these targets, which had been established in light of the need to build on the achievements of 2012 and 2013, would be tracked and closely monitored during the implementation of the activities laid out in the Plan.

These were the Generalized System of Preferences (GSP) scheme, the African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA), and the Haiti Trade Preference Programmes - which included the Haiti Economic Lift Programme (HELP) Act, the Haitian Hemispheric Opportunity through Partnership Encouragement (HOPE) Act and the Caribbean Basin Trade Partnership Act (CBTPA). Each trade preference programme provided duty-free access to beneficiary country products entering the US market under specific tariff lines covered by the respective programme. According to recent analysis, 97.5% of US tariff lines were provided on a DFQF basis to LDCs in Sub-Saharan African. Through AGOA, one-way access to the US market had been provided for the past 13 years.

The representative of India, supported by the representative of Pakistan, said that the implementation of the special provisions ought not to be viewed in a formalistic way, in terms of the legal provisions, but rather at a substantive level. An evaluation of the provision allowing for transitional periods was desirable since they constituted the majority of the provisions. Additional substantive information was useful, for example on safeguard actions involving developing countries' exports under the provisions of the Agreement on Textiles and Clothing. Although this was not legally included in the realm of special provision listed in favour of developing countries, these types of action nevertheless had an impact on the export performance of developing countries. Likewise, even if there were no specific provision in the Anti-Dumping Agreement relating to developing countries, a large                                                                                   WT/COMTD/M/9                                                                                   Page 3 number of products exported by developing countries had been subject to anti-dumping actions.

Based on the outcome of that discussion and comments received from delegations, the Committee had agreed that he come forward with a revised version of Draft Guidelines for WTO Technical Cooperation for discussion at today's meeting. Such guidelines had been circulated to delegations and incorporated comments received from them. The revised draft guidelines contained a framework for considering specific action as well as the specific matters addressed. He also recalled WT/COMTD/M/9 Page 4 that, at the Committee's last meeting, he had noted that a number of replies had been received from Members to the questionnaire which he had sent in May of this year to ascertain the overall needs for assistance in trade-related matters. He urged those Members who had not yet done so to provide comments, since a critical mass of replies was needed before an authoritative picture could be drawn.

It was not clear to her delegation what a balanced relationship between trade and development signified. Her delegation continued to question the appropriateness of including representatives of the private sector in capacity building activities.

The representative of Egypt thanked the Chairman for his efforts in drawing up the revised guidelines and said that they should note, as had been done in the informal note presented by the delegation of Switzerland, that the entry into force of the Uruguay Agreements had increased the need for technical assistance. The Preamble to the Agreement establishing the WTO noted the need to ensure that developing countries, specially the least-developed, secured a share in the growth of international trade commensurate with the needs of economic development. The guidelines needed to underline both the importance of technical assistance and the vital importance of implementing the commitments on technical assistance. She questioned whether the aim of maintaining geographic balance was compatible with the priorities implied in the draft guidelines and the designation of African countries as priority countries. She furthermore recalled that the General Council's Decision of 31 January 1995 relating to technical cooperation activities referred only to developing countries. Additional funds would therefore need to be secured for assistance to economies in transition. The section headed ""Principles and Objectives"" rather than ""Subject Matter"" should mention that increased knowledge of the multilateral trading rules was vital for the full integration of developing countries in the trading system. She furthermore suggested to include the supply of data bases and training in their effective use and information technology in general as one of the principles and objectives.","WTCOMTDM9.pdf","Egypt, Chairman, Switzerland, Uruguay, WTO, General, Council"

The representative of Tanzania said that he agreed with the representative of Egypt, but that he would refrain from further elaboration in deference to the Chairman's remarks.

"10387",10387,"22","22.     The representative of Norway clarified that the subject matter of technical assistance activities was also of relevance to Members other than developing countries, and welcomed the fact that Norway's comments made at previous meetings had been taken into account in the revised draft which he could agree to with the exception of its reference to the private sector as beneficiary of WTO technical assistance. Technical assistance activities of each organization should be restricted to areas of their competence. He agreed with the Chairman that this was neither the stage nor the forum to make general declarations or to ask for additional funds. An agreement on the guidelines could however act as a spur for increased funding.

As presently drafted it could be interpreted to mean that technical assistance was conditional on full integration in the global system. He also asked that priorities not exclude other developing countries than those specified. He had doubts whether the guidelines needed to include principles for technical assistance and suggested that Section 1 be entitled simply ""Objectives"", rather than ""Principles, Objectives and Priorities"".","WTCOMTDM9.pdf","India"

"10393",10393,"28","28.      The representative of the European Communities said that, at this stage of the discussions, the Committee should be finalizing the document. The guidelines were operational rather than political and should set an operational framework for technical assistance activities. His delegation was satisfied with the broad principles underlying the revised version of the draft guidelines. He acknowledged that there could be disagreement on details; such as to whom, in addition to the public sector, activities should be extended, and on the modalities for their review. While agreeing that beneficiaries should be primarily those countries in greatest need, others should not be excluded. Technical assistance activities should remain as flexible as possible. He warned that a tight definition of implementation modalities would give the programmes not enough flexibility to respond to future needs.

She asked that traineeships within the WTO Secretariat be included as part of technical assistance provided by the WTO. She stressed the importance of the private sector and agreed that participation of the private sector in technical assistance activities should be organized in consultation with the government.

She wondered whether, in addition to the subjects listed under ""Priorities"", there would be other subject priorities. Her delegation was of the opinion that, rather than at national level, trade policy courses conducted at a regional level or conducted on the basis of language would be more cost-effective. She wondered whether the resources of a multilateral institution such as WTO should be used for bilateral assistance programmes. If this were the case, what types of programmes would they be funding?

The modes of delivery depended on the requirements and no attempt should therefore be made to establish priorities. She proposed the following reformulation of the item on coordination: coordination and cooperation with relevant international organizations, with a view to ensuring coordination and the complementing of various programmes as well as to avoiding duplication. She also suggested that specific reference be made to joint efforts with the ITC and UNCTAD, particularly in establishing a central inventory of programmes. She suggested to add the exchange of information with recipient countries so as to attain a more complete picture of different technical assistance programmes. She proposed, for management purposes, a two-year, rather than a three-year plan to coincide with the cycle of Ministerial conferences, with adjustments on an annual basis. She agreed that the plan be submitted to appropriate bodies of WTO. The role of the General Council and the Budget Committee should be further elaborated. The concept of national cost sharing should be clarified: it should not become a precondition for technical assistance, particularly to least-developed countries. She suggested that dispute settlement be specified as an area eligible for technical assistance.

Technical assistance could be directed towards assessing the weaknesses and strengths of national trade and economic policy: this would increase the interest of his country in technical assistance. An integrated approach with other international organizations was essential for technical assistance activities to bear results. In this context he recalled the Director-General's observation that programmes needed to be tailored to meet the specific circumstances of a country, and that they not be restricted to any one activity.

She supported Australia's suggestion to include a reference to the ITC in the section on international coordination.

"10414",10414,"47","47.      The Chairman invited Members to work with him to prepare a further revision of the guidelines. Such guidelines were not designed to be a political statement but rather an instrument to manage resources efficiently, equitably and with flexibility. After the Committee had finalized the guidelines, it would be the time to consider the criteria on which to evaluate technical assistance. A political statement on the importance of technical assistance would be contained in the CTD's report to Ministers. In response to comments made by delegations, he drew attention to the headnote in the draft guidelines which referred only to developing countries as beneficiaries of WTO technical assistance and not to economies in transition. However, he pointed out that the periodic review by Ministers of the operational directives and implementation modalities would provide an opportunity to modify the priorities. While it was clear to which countries in Africa the draft guidelines referred, he would nevertheless consult with Members whether more precision was needed. He clarified that the draft guidelines in no way intended to interfere with national policy, but that rather, they intended to fully acquaint officials involved in the shaping of national policy with WTO rules. He also noted that the WTO was a young organization and that priorities could be adjusted as experience was gained in implementing the guidelines. The more fundamental concerns of capacity building could be addressed in collaboration with other institutions.","WTCOMTDM9.pdf","Chairman, Members, Committee, CTD, WTO, Africa, Members, WTO, WTO"

This study was now available and had been circulated to delegation in document WT/COMTD/W/15.

"10416",10416,"49","49.     The representative of the United States noted that the analysis contained in document WT/COMTD/W/15 confirmed that both domestic and external factors, many inter-related, influenced the performance of low and medium-income countries in world trade, and did so in different ways. The first conclusion he drew from the report was that a liberal trade regime was good for the economy; lower import protection gave stronger export growth. Second, stable domestic economic policies attracted investment. Third, access to foreign markets was not the single determinant of export performances: some countries with poor export performance had better access to industrial country markets than some whose exports expanded rapidly. Many industrialized countries gave preferential access to low and medium-income developing countries, which was not fully utilized due to domestic reasons. Evidence of the benefits from the results of the Uruguay Round already existed, which would increase as implementation advanced. Developing countries should adopt liberal trade and investment regimes and foster strong vibrant and stable economies. This would permit them to take full advantage of the multilateral trading system.","WTCOMTDM9.pdf","United, States, Uruguay, Round"
"10417",10417,"5","5.       The Chairman urged delegations to inform the Committee of their experience with the implementation of those provisions, since some of them were only triggered if specific requests were made. Unless information based on individual experience of countries was received, any evaluation of the implementation risked being incomplete. The debate served to evaluate the extent to which, and how, the different provisions were applied or used by developing countries since the entry into force of the WTO in January 1995, and to help provide an input into the Committee's report to Ministers with appropriate recommendations on this matter.","WTCOMTDM9.pdf","Chairman, Committee, WTO, Committee"
"10418",10418,"50","50.      The representative of Norway said that the analysis in document WT/COMTD/W/15 confirmed that trade stimulated growth and was a means to reduce poverty. The report noted that, with appropriate policies, commodity poor countries could achieve high growth. Trade was more important than aid and economic growth in the poorer and most aid-dependent countries needed the best possible climate for trade. Stimulating trade among developing countries and with industrialized countries was a priority and his country supported WTO's efforts to increase developing countries' understanding of the multilateral trading framework in order to benefit from it.","WTCOMTDM9.pdf","Norway, WTO"
"10419",10419,"51","51.      The representative of Japan said that the integration into the global economy of developing countries was a means of encouraging sustainable development. Economic development depended to a large extent on developing countries' ability to promote institutional and human development. It was useful to note the contrast in economic policies adopted by certain fast growing Asian economies and those adopted by certain least-developed countries, particularly those in Africa, which were being marginalized in the world economy. Such successful policies promoted agriculture, promoted small and medium-sized industries, increased productivity in the agricultural sector and encouraged the production of value-added products in agriculture-based industries. Domestic competition among small and medium-sized industries had the potential of raising productivity.","WTCOMTDM9.pdf","Japan, Africa"
"10420",10420,"52","52.       The representative of India said that the study contained in document WT/COMTD/W/15 was a useful attempt taking into consideration the constraints under which the Secretariat worked. He could not conclude from the document, as the representative of the United States had done, that domestic policies were primarily responsible for poor economic growth. This appeared an over-simplification of a complex situation. He noted a heavy reliance on IMF and World Bank documentation and was of the view that more use could have been made of information from other sources which were also in the public domain. While he acknowledged the role of foreign investment, the document's emphasis on the importance of foreign investment seemed to overlook the fact that domestic investment was critical for economic growth. The analysis seemed to take little account of the importance of domestic saving ratios. In that context, he noted that the observation that the lack of national saving was among the factors that accounted for the lion's share of responsibility for the lack of economic growth, as quoted in a footnote, should have received more prominence in the body of the report. The observation that Asian countries were increasing their participation in the globalization process should have been made at a less aggregate level: it was not applicable to a country such as his. The document pointed to the strong investment performance of Asian countries. However, figures in UNCTAD's World Investment Report showed that, if the figures relating to China were excluded, no dramatic changes in the trends of investment flows to developing countries had taken place. He welcomed the acknowledgement of the poor quality of international statistics on foreign direct investment. He was also pleased to see specific reference made to the effect of anti-dumping measures on the export WT/COMTD/M/9 Page 10 performance of developing and least-developed countries. The observation that Uruguay Round tariff reduction had limited effect on preferences was followed by a statement that a large share of exports to the European Communities by African countries consisted of petroleum products at zero duty. Countries imported products at zero duty for domestic reasons, as his country did in the case of foodgrains at times of food shortage. Were there other measures which improved market access for petroleum products exported by African countries to the European Communities? He noted that tariff escalation had a significant effect on the capability of developing countries to export, unlike the conclusions in the study, supported by a quote from a World Bank Report. The study should perhaps more appropriately have highlighted products affected by tariff escalation rather than those which were not. The constraints on foreign investment as described in the study supported his earlier observation on the role of domestic saving. The description of the difficulties facing African countries illustrated the complexity of the issue. Given the study's WTO origin, disapproval of protectionist policies was to be expected. He took it that both the protectionist policy adopted by developed and developing countries were disapproved of. He wondered how the identification of domestic protection as the main source of distortion could be reconciled with evidence that fast growing east Asian economies had high rates of protection in the initial years. The causes and effects relation of the macroeconomic policies mentioned in paragraph 60 (trade performance, exchange rates, budget deficits), could perhaps be clarified. Moreover, there was enough research available on the positive and the negative effects of FDI and commenting only on the positive aspects, as in paragraph 70, distorted reality.","WTCOMTDM9.pdf","India, Secretariat, United, States, IMF, World, Bank, UNCTAD, China, Uruguay, Round, WTO"

"10422",10422,"54","54.      The representative of Canada said that the study in document WT/COMTD/W/15 had struck a good balance between external and internal factors which affected the participation of developing countries in the multilateral trading system. Domestic factors were the prime determinant of the level of participation in the multilateral trading system. The Secretariat had been fairly rigorous in its analysis. The inability of least-developed countries to benefit from the market opening opportunities following the Uruguay Round illustrated that in the case of such countries capacity building was more important than market access. The paper could perhaps have dealt more with the inter-linkages between domestic trade policy and domestic investment policy. He agreed with the representative of India that domestic savings were important, but was of the view that the report dealt with it adequately. He would have preferred that the study also included trade in services. Developing countries had made significant progress in trade in this sector and the opportunities for greater participation contributing to growth and development were significant.","WTCOMTDM9.pdf","Canada, Secretariat, Uruguay, Round, India"
"10423",10423,"55","55.      The representative of Cuba agreed with the representative of India that the report attributed lack of growth unduly to national policies. The distortion of the sugar trade due to foreign subsidies and import quotas was a clear example of the adverse effect of such policies on developing countries. A recent seminar had highlighted the negative and positive aspects of foreign investment. While he agreed that FDI could have positive effects, he was nevertheless of the view that commitments in the area of transfer of technology and the employment of nationals would ensure that FDI would promote national economic policy.

He was of the view that the two concluding paragraphs should have been developed in more detail. As noted in the report, market access was only one factor affecting the export performance of developing countries. There were reports which demonstrated that the effect of tariff escalation on the export capabilities was sometimes exaggerated. He agreed that domestic savings represented an important factor in economic growth and suggested that a study on income distribution policies was warranted as well.","WTCOMTDM9.pdf","European, Communities"
"10425",10425,"57","57.      The representative of Switzerland welcomed the Secretariat's study in document WT/COMTD/W/15, which had fully used available information. The complexity of the situation analysed in the document pointed to measures which had to be taken. It was clear that for many it was not the lack of market access but the lack of capacity that stopped them benefiting fully from the results of the Uruguay Round. This was a problem which could be met primarily at the national level but could be supplemented by technical assistance to develop human capacity and to make full use of resources.","WTCOMTDM9.pdf","Switzerland, Secretariat, Uruguay"
"10426",10426,"58","58.       The representative of New Zealand said that the Secretariat's paper provided a good background and had distilled previous studies on similar issues. The diverse experience among developing countries did not lend itself to easy explanations. Some common factors were the high correlation between the share of manufactured goods in merchandise export and export performance as well as the positive correlation between exports and share of investment in GDP. It was noteworthy that countries with strong export growth had lower levels of protection and less exchange rate volatility. In some sectors such as agriculture, textiles, clothing, fish and fish products problems of market access persisted. Her delegation was of the view that multilateral liberalization efforts needed to tackle tariff peaks and tariff escalation since these discouraged further processing of basic commodities in developing countries. The study also clearly pointed out the need for an appropriate domestic economic and trade policy environment. The dynamic linkages between such a policy environment and economic and trade growth was clearly demonstrated by her country's own experience, which was of particular relevance, given the high share of production of agricultural, forestry and other primary products. Along with appropriate domestic policies and improved market access and a hospitable and facilitating environment, development assistance and technical assistance were required to strengthen the infrastructure and the institutional and human resource capacities, particularly in least-developed countries. She urged cooperation with UNCTAD and ITC in the area of technical assistance.","WTCOMTDM9.pdf","New, Zealand, Secretariat, UNCTAD, ITC"
"10427",10427,"59","59.      A representative from the Secretariat said that, first, the perceived lack of emphasis in the study on the importance of domestic savings simply resulted from the fact that its importance was so evident that it had been taken for granted as a basic assumption: it was clear that foreign direct investment could in no way take the place of a high rate of domestic savings. Though certainly macroeconomic stability, exchange rate variability and export growth were interlinked, the dominant direction was from better macroeconomic policies to better export performance and better flows of FDI. In the study, the Secretariat had attempted to provide a balanced and objective reflection of the views which were available in the existing literature on the subject, rather than to come to any conclusion or to advance solutions.","WTCOMTDM9.pdf","Secretariat, Secretariat"

However, the subject had not been addressed in the Committee for several years, and in this light his delegation welcomed the updated Secretariat note contained in document WT/COMTD/W/196 and the opportunity it provided to review the application of special provisions in the Multilateral Trade Agreements and related Ministerial Decisions in favour of developing country Members, as paragraph 3 of the CTD's terms of reference mandated the Committee to do periodically. He indicated that the updated Secretariat note contained valuable information on the manner in which S&D provisions were being implemented, including whether any provisions were not being implemented sufficiently or not being implemented at all. The six categories of S&D provisions that had been identified contained key elements that were fundamental to the balance that was created at the conclusion of the Uruguay Round. He went on to say that, in the view of his delegation, the establishment of the MM did not relieve the CTD of its duty to comply with paragraph 3 of its terms of reference. To strengthen the CTD's work in this regard, Ecuador suggested that Members conduct a factual review of S&D provisions on the basis of the information contained in the updated Secretariat note. The intention was to maintain an oversight of S&D, which was one of the pillars of the multilateral trading system.","WTCOMTDM90.pdf","Ecuador, CTD, Committee, Secretariat, Members, CTD, Committee, Secretariat, Uruguay, Round, CTD, CTD, Ecuador, Members, Secretariat"

The representative of Uganda, on behalf of the LDC Group, said that S&D provisions, which were an integral part of the multilateral trading system, were meant to provide necessary flexibilities to the weakest and most vulnerable countries. However, despite repeated promises, the implementation of S&D provisions was weak, voluntary and largely ineffective. No significant headway had been made with regard to the mandate contained in paragraph 44 of the Doha Ministerial Declaration to make the provisions more precise, effective and operational. In addition, substantial progress had not been made in exploring new S&D provisions and making them an integral and mandatory part of the WTO Agreements. The full and faithful implementation of S&D provisions was important to allow the LDCs to benefit from trade liberalization, to use trade for sustainable development purposes and to safeguard the interests of their people.","WTCOMTDM90.pdf","Uganda, LDC, Group, WTO"

He welcomed the establishment of the MM and noted that, even though it was not a negotiating forum, the LDCs were optimistic that it would provide developing countries with the opportunity to meaningfully and objectively assess and review the implementation of S&D provisions in order to facilitate the integration of these countries into the multilateral trading system. He also noted that it was important to distinguish between the MM and the CTDSS, and to develop complementary and collaborative approaches between the two.

He explained that, through the proposal, the proponents wished to establish an institutional linkage between the CTD and other WTO bodies. Such reporting would facilitate the work of the CTD as the focal point for the consideration and coordination of work on development in the WTO.

She explained that the proposal was for the CTD to report to the General Council on development work in the WTO, in accordance with its mandate and in fulfilment of the instructions from Ministers at MC8 that the CTD fully operationalize that mandate. She indicated that it was unfortunate that Members should find themselves in the position to have to approve something that Ministers had                                          WT/COMTD/M/90                                                -6- already directed. While it had been previously suggested in an intervention that Members should wait until the MM was established in order to assess its relationship with the MC8 mandate, she did not believe that the MM could fulfill the MC8 mandate. The MM dealt with S&D provisions, which were only a part of the development work of the WTO. She noted that MC9 had been successfully concluded in December 2013, but Members still had not followed Ministers' instructions from MC8.

However, Ministers had not directed the CTD to report on the development work taking place in other WTO bodies and the US was not in a position to support the proposal. The CTD reported annually on its activities, in accordance with its terms of reference, and his delegation believed that the report was appropriate. Furthermore, in the view of his delegation, paragraph 3 of the CTD's terms of reference did not mandate the Committee to report on the development work of other WTO bodies. Rather, this paragraph directed the CTD to review, in consultation with other relevant bodies, the application of S&D provisions.

This reporting would not add value, as it would duplicate existing reporting obligations and risked interfering with the work of other WTO bodies.

In this section, it was mentioned that there was no formal indication of any recourse by developing countries to the flexibilities contained in Article 12.2 of the Agreement. She explained that one of the reasons why developing countries had not used this provision was because there was no definition of a net-food exporter. If a definition could be agreed upon, it was likely that developing countries would make use of Article 12.2. In this light, she suggested that the CTD could make a recommendation to the Committee on Agriculture to develop a definition of a net-food exporter.

The CTD was a special body in the WTO, since it was the focal point for the consideration and coordination of development-related work, and therefore had an overarching mandate.

The most recent contribution of the CTD to the Work Programme was the Workshop on ""E-Commerce, Development and Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises"", which was held on 8 and 9 April 2013. The workshop was held in the context of the Ministerial Decision at MC8 to continue to re-invigorate the development dimension of the Work Programme. The report on the workshop, which was contained in document WT/COMTD/W/198, highlighted that infrastructure problems were a major hurdle for developing countries.

In this regard, he drew Members' attention to the Ministerial Decision of 7 December 2013 on the Work Programme on E-Commerce taken at MC9, which was contained in documents WT/MIN(13)/32 and WT/L/907. The Decision indicated, inter alia, that any relevant body of the Work Programme could explore appropriate mechanisms to address the relationship between e-commerce and development in a focused and comprehensive manner. The Decision also indicated that the Work Programme would take forward the issues emerging in the discussions and the evolving application of e-commerce to enhance economic and development opportunities, with special consideration of the situation in developing countries, particularly in least-developed country Members and least-connected countries. The Work Programme would continue to examine opportunities and challenges for access to e-commerce by micro, small and medium-sized enterprises, including small producers and suppliers.","WTCOMTDM90.pdf","Members, CTD, Members, Work, Programme, Work, Programme, Members, Work, Programme"

He encouraged Members wishing to suggest ways to take forward the e-commerce work in the CTD to consider submitting written proposals, as written submissions were more conducive to a focused discussion. Finally, he informed the Committee that, as indicated in the Ministerial Decision of 7 December 2013, the General Council would hold periodic reviews on the Work Programme on E-Commerce based on the reports submitted by the WTO bodies entrusted with the implementation of the Work Programme.

"10490",10490,"51","51.     The representative of Paraguay, on behalf of the LLDC Group, said that he wished to share with Members the status of the UN's Almaty Programme of Action (PoA) for LLDCs. Launched in 2003, the Almaty PoA had the objective of addressing the specific difficulties of LLDCs and promoting their development. The PoA had a number of components, including components relating to transit and infrastructure creation. He said that a lack of infrastructure, combined with geographical isolation, were key difficulties that added to costs and delays, and therefore hindered LLDCs' participation in international trade. A review of the PoA was scheduled to take place at the Second UN Conference for LLDCs, which would be held in November 2014 in Vienna. Before the conference, a number of preparatory meetings were being organized by the UN Office of the High Representative for the LDCs, LLDCs and Small Island Developing States (UN-OHRLLS). These included intergovernmental meetings, meetings with specialized agencies, and meetings with the private sector. Regional meetings had been held in Addis Ababa, Asunción and Vientiane. Fourteen                                         WT/COMTD/M/90                                                -9- pre-conference thematic sessions had been organized thus far.

"10491",10491,"52","52.      He went on to say that the preparatory work for the conference began in September 2012, when LLDC Ministers noted the strengths and weaknesses of the PoA and expressed their expectations regarding future work. As part of their assessment, Ministers had suggested that a more holistic approach be taken in the future in order to address the issues of concern to LLDCs, which included infrastructure issues, job creation and poverty reduction. Trade would continue to play a fundamental role in future work. In this regard, he stressed the importance of policies that were designed to add value in production and decrease transport costs and waiting times at border posts. He also stressed the importance that LLDCs attached to foreign investment and to an increased participation in global value chains and in the services sector. On the trade front, he believed that an important step forward had been taken in the WTO with the conclusion of the negotiations at MC9 on the Agreement on Trade Facilitation, which contained an Article on freedom of transit. He hoped that there would be an immediate and effective application of this provision. He added that the LLDCs were seeking effective market access, which would help in their efforts to diversify their production structure. In concluding, he expressed his hope that the international community would continue to support the efforts of LLDCs, and that the outcome document of the Second UN Conference on LLDCs would be an effective tool in addressing the concerns of LLDCs.","WTCOMTDM90.pdf","LLDCs, WTO, Trade, Facilitation, LLDCs, LLDCs, LLDCs"

The Chairman said that he wished to provide Members with a brief update on the RTAs notified under the Enabling Clause that were to be considered in the CTD's Dedicated Sessions on RTAs. He firstly informed the Committee that the Agreement between Cuba and El Salvador had been notified on 27 November 2013 in document WT/COMTD/N/43. The parties had been requested to provide the necessary data to the Secretariat for the preparation of the factual presentation by 24 April 2014. With regard to the Agreement between the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) and India, he said that the Secretariat had sent the draft factual presentation to the parties. Comments had been received from India, but the Secretariat was still waiting to receive comments from ASEAN.","WTCOMTDM90.pdf","Chairman, Members, CTD, Committee, Cuba, El, Salvador, Secretariat, the, Association, of, Southeast, Asian, Nations, ASEAN, India, Secretariat, India, Secretariat, ASEAN"

For a number of other RTAs - namely, RTAs between India and Nepal, India and Afghanistan, and India and Bhutan - the full set of data needed to complete the factual presentations had not been submitted by the parties. The Secretariat was also still waiting to receive some data relating to the accession of Rwanda and Burundi to the Protocol on the Establishment of the East African Community Customs Union. He urged the parties to these agreements to provide the data as soon as possible. He went on to say that there remained one RTA notified under the Enabling Clause that had not been ratified by all the parties. This was the Pacific Island Countries Trade Agreement (PICTA). Following the procedures of the Committee on Regional Trade Agreements (CRTA), a factual presentation of an RTA falling in this category would only be drafted after the agreement had been ratified by all the parties. The parties to PICTA were urged to inform the Secretariat as soon as all ratifications were complete.","WTCOMTDM90.pdf","India, Nepal, India, Afghanistan, India, Bhutan, Secretariat, Rwanda, Burundi, East, African, Community, Customs, Union, RTA, Pacific, Island, Committee, CRTA, RTA, Secretariat"

"10498",10498,"59","59.      The representative of Egypt said that systemic concerns had been raised by some Members, including Egypt, over the legal and procedural implications of the dual notification of the GCC Customs Union under both the Enabling Clause and GATT Article XXIV. He noted that a number of delegations had previously expressed the view that the Enabling Clause did not provide the appropriate legal basis to justify the formation of a customs union involving the reduction or elimination of non-tariff measures (NTMs). However, others had argued that the non-prescription of criteria or conditions for the elimination of NTMs did not exclude customs unions among developing countries from the coverage of the Enabling Clause. The view of his delegation was that the CTD was the appropriate forum to consider the questions arising from RTAs with a dual notification. This originated from the CTD's terms of reference, which stipulated that the CTD was the focal point for the consideration and coordination of work on development in the WTO. In addition, paragraph 4 of the terms of reference mandated the CTD to consider any questions with regard to either the application or the use of special provisions in the Multilateral Trade Agreements and related Ministerial Decisions in favour of developing country Members, which included questions relating to the invocation of the Enabling Clause to notify customs unions among developing countries. He hoped that Members could have a substantive discussion on the systemic concerns that had been raised. The present sub-item needed to be maintained on the CTD's agenda until a solution was found.","WTCOMTDM90.pdf","Egypt, Members, Egypt, GCC, Customs, Union, GATT, CTD, CTD, CTD, WTO, CTD, Members, Members, CTD"

"10500",10500,"60","60.     The representative of India said that his intervention related to the first three sub-items under the present agenda item. He recalled that requests had previously been made by some delegations to remove the three sub-items from the CTD's agenda, as these sub-items had apparently served the purpose of transparency. He indicated his surprise with this reasoning, since the points that had been raised by China, Egypt and India in document WT/COMTD/W/175 remained pertinent and had not been addressed by the Committee. He went on to list a number of points which he believed were necessary for Members to consider. These included the need for an understanding of the legal and procedural implications of dual notifications of RTAs under both the Enabling Clause and GATT Article XXIV. Members needed to consider the roles of the CRTA and the CTD in the consideration of RTAs with a dual notification, and also needed to consider whether a Member could unilaterally notify an RTA under a specific legal provision, without the consent of the other parties. His delegation also wished to explore the implications of a notification of an RTA under the Enabling Clause being retained but without a consideration of the RTA taking place in the CTD on the basis of a factual presentation.","WTCOMTDM90.pdf","India, CTD, China, Egypt, India, Committee, Members, GATT, Members, CRTA, CTD, Member, RTA, RTA, RTA, CTD"
"10501",10501,"61","61.      He observed that there were three RTAs that had been notified under both the Enabling Clause and GATT Article XXIV - the GCC Customs Union, the ASEAN-Korea Agreement and the India-Korea Agreement - and none of these RTAs had as yet been considered by Members under the Transparency Mechanism (TM) for RTAs. Some delegations had made a distinction between the GCC Customs Union and the other two RTAs, and it had been suggested that the GCC Customs Union notification under the Enabling Clause was incorrect. His delegation did not agree with this. In fact, the issues surrounding the three RTAs were similar. Although the GCC Customs Union was a customs union while the other two were not, the TM for RTAs had the same procedures for customs unions and other RTAs. Moreover, these procedures did not cover any of the three RTAs in question, since all three were simultaneously notified under both the Enabling Clause and GATT Article XXIV.","WTCOMTDM90.pdf","GATT, GCC, Customs, Union, Members, GCC, Customs, Union, GCC, Customs, Union, GCC, Customs, Union, GATT"
"10502",10502,"62","62.      He recalled that some Members had suggested that many of the issues raised in document WT/COMTD/W/175 should be discussed in the Negotiating Group on Rules (NGR). In response, he said that the mandate of the NGR was limited and could not capture the entire gamut of systemic and specific concerns arising from dual notifications. Members were also unclear as to the future work schedule of the NGR and it therefore became even more important to discuss the matter in the CTD. He reminded Members that India had made a proposal in the NGR, which he indicated was supported by many developing countries. The proposal was that Members continue with the existing practice of considering RTAs notified under the Enabling Clause in the CTD and RTAs notified under GATT Article XXIV and GATS Article V in the CRTA. For RTAs with a dual notification, the suggestion was that these RTAs be considered in the CTD. There were two reasons for this, the first being that the CTD had a mandate for review and secondly the Enabling Clause was lex specialis. He concluded by requesting that the first three sub-items under the present agenda item be retained on the agenda of the next CTD meeting, since the systemic and specific issues arising from RTAs with a dual notification remained unaddressed. He suggested that informal consultations held by the Chairman could help to resolve the matter.

"10503",10503,"63","63.     The representative of the United States said that there was a divergence of views as to whether the GCC Customs Union was a case of a dual notification. His delegation believed that the GCC Customs Union issue was not an issue of dual notification, and was therefore different from the discussion relating to the ASEAN-Korea Agreement and the India-Korea Agreement. The US remained of the view that the GCC Customs Union had been incorrectly notified under the Enabling Clause. This was subsequently corrected, and the understanding of his delegation was that the GCC Customs Union was in the pipeline to be considered in the CRTA in line with the procedures of the RTAs TM. The US considered this issue closed and continued to request that the present sub-item be removed from the CTD's agenda, as it had served its purpose. Turning to document WT/COMTD/W/175, he said that his delegation had not seen any specific issues relating to the GCC Customs Union. Rather, the paper appeared to be seeking a systemic discussion on RTAs, which was a discussion that was outside the scope of the CTD and belonged in the NGR. He indicated that the US was not open to a CTD process to discuss systemic issues concerning RTAs.","WTCOMTDM90.pdf","United, States, GCC, Customs, Union, GCC, Customs, Union, US, GCC, Customs, Union, GCC, Customs, Union, CRTA, US, CTD, GCC, Customs, Union, CTD, US, CTD"
"10504",10504,"64","64.     The representative of China expressed support for the interventions by Egypt and India. His delegation saw similarities between the three RTAs notified under both the Enabling Clause and GATT Article XXIV, and therefore had similar concerns with the three. He observed that the matter was of significance to developing country Members and to the multilateral trading system. The communication from China, Egypt and India contained in document WT/COMTD/W/175 was designed to help Members enhance their understanding of the systemic and specific issues arising from dual notifications, with a view to facilitating an expeditious solution. It was appropriate for the CTD, as the focal point for development work in the WTO, to have a substantive discussion on the dual notification issue. He said that his delegation wanted the first three sub-items under the presentation agenda item to remain on the CTDs agenda until the systemic problems were addressed.","WTCOMTDM90.pdf","China, Egypt, India, GATT, Members, China, Egypt, India, Members, CTD, WTO"
"10505",10505,"65","65.      The representative of Egypt noted that the US had mentioned that the GCC Customs Union issue was not an issue of dual notification. He said that he did not understand the rationale behind this. He also expressed his surprise with the US' understanding that the GCC Customs Union was in the pipeline to be considered in the CRTA. This was of concern to his delegation, since the discussion in the CTD of the dual notification of the GCC Customs Union, as well as of the dual notifications of the ASEAN-Korea and India-Korea Agreements, had not been exhausted. He indicated that he would inform himself of the situation in the CRTA after the present meeting and requested that the first three sub-items under the present agenda item remain on the CTD's agenda.","WTCOMTDM90.pdf","Egypt, US, GCC, Customs, Union, US, GCC, Customs, Union, CRTA, CTD, GCC, Customs, Union, CRTA, CTD"

She added that her delegation perceived differences between the GCC Customs Union notification and the notifications concerning the ASEAN-Korea Agreement and the India-Korea Agreement. If Members wished to have a systemic discussion on RTAs, the view of her delegation was that the NGR was the appropriate forum.

The Chairman recalled that, at the Eighth Ministerial Conference (MC8), Ministers had, inter alia, reaffirmed the positive link between trade and development and called for focused work in the CTD.

Paragraph 26 of the TM for PTAs indicated that the Mechanism would apply on a provisional basis until Members approved its permanent application. The paragraph also indicated that Members would review the Mechanism after three years and if necessary modify the Mechanism in light of the experience gained from its provisional operation. He went on to say that three years had elapsed since the General Council Decision which established the PTAs TM. Members would, therefore, need to consider the question of the review of the Mechanism. Whether enough experience had been gained yet to conduct a review would also be for Members to determine.

He went on to say that he wished to draw Members' attention to the Ministerial Decision of 7 December 2013 taken at MC9 and contained in documents WT/MIN(13)/44 and WT/L/919. The Decision indicated, inter alia, that developed country Members that did not yet provide DFQF market access for at least 97% of products originating from LDCs, defined at the tariff line level, would seek to improve their existing DFQF coverage for such products, so as to provide increasingly greater market access to LDCs, prior to the next Ministerial Conference. The Decision also indicated that developing country Members declaring themselves in a position to do so, would seek to provide DFQF market access for products originating from LDCs, or would seek to improve their existing DFQF coverage for such products, so as to provide increasingly greater market access to LDCs, prior to the next Ministerial Conference. He also pointed out that, according to the Decision, Members were to notify DFQF schemes for LDCs and any other relevant changes pursuant to the TM for PTAs. Furthermore, the CTD was to continue to annually review the steps taken to provide DFQF market access to the LDCs, and report to the General Council for appropriate action. To aid in its review, the Secretariat would, in close coordination with Members, prepare a report on Members’ DFQF market access for LDCs at the tariff line level based on their notifications. He concluded by assuring Members that the CTD would undertake the work specified in the Decision.","WTCOMTDM90.pdf","Members, Members, Members, Members, LDCs, CTD, General, Council, Secretariat, Members, Members, LDCs, Members, CTD"

At this stage, it was important for Members to implement the Decision. He observed that the Decision was not an end in itself, but rather a means to an end with the view to fulfilling Annex F of the Hong Kong Ministerial Declaration, and in line with paragraph 1.11 of the Bali Ministerial Declaration. The LDCs commended those Members that had already attained the 97% mark and encouraged others to do so as well. It was important for preference-granting countries to fulfill the notification requirements and make available the utilization rates in their DFQF schemes. The LDCs had taken note of the notifications made by various developed and developing countries and encouraged Members to provide DFQF market access for all products originating from LDCs in a manner that ensured stability, security and predictability. It was essential that developed countries ensured that products of commercial interest to LDCs were effectively included in their schemes. Developing countries in a position to do so were encouraged to enhance their market access conditions for LDCs. Finally, he stressed the importance of rules of origin in DFQF schemes and called on Members to make their rules of origin transparent, simple and objective, in line with the guidelines agreed to by Ministers at MC9.","WTCOMTDM90.pdf","Uganda, LDC, Group, LDCs, Members, Hong, Kong, LDCs, Members, LDCs, Members, LDCs, LDCs, Members"

Noting that some Members had inquired about the substantial carryover of funds at the end of 2013, she indicated that a few observations would help to explain the situation. She said firstly that, in 2013, nearly 70% of contributions had arrived in the fourth quarter. Combined with the fact that some activities normally foreseen in the last months of the year could not take place at the end of 2013 in light of the Ninth Ministerial Conference (MC9) held in December, the result was a substantial carry-over. She also pointed to a number of examples of measures that had been put in place to allow the WTO to provide TA services at a lower cost. One example was the E-Learning strategy, which had reduced the number of face-to-face activities. Other examples included the greater emphasis being placed on leveraging partnerships to ensure that implementing partners contributed resources, and the introduction of the Progressive Learning Strategy (PLS) to promote better targeting of course content and therefore more efficient programming. Certain programmes and activities had been reviewed and redesigned, and the implementation of results-based management (RBM) as a management tool had also started to contribute to resource efficiency. In closing, she suggested that it could be relevant going forward to review the way budget estimates were prepared for the next biennial TA Plan so as to reduce the gap between estimates and actual costs.","WTCOMTDM91.pdf","Members, WTO"

He noted that, in the Marrakesh Agreement, Ministers had paid special attention to the situation of LDCs and had recognized the need for the provision of TA and capacity building. It was on this basis that Ministers had agreed in paragraph 38 of the Doha Declaration to create a framework for TA and capacity building within the WTO so as to improve the participation of the LDCs in the multilateral trading system. The LDCs were pleased to note that, since the                                           WT/COMTD/M/91                                                  -4- launch of the Doha Round, the WTO's TA had grown substantially. He referred to the biennial TA Plan, as well as to the Enhanced Integrated Framework, the Standards and Trade Development Facility and the WTO Reference Centres. While acknowledging the priority given to LDCs in the delivery of TA, he emphasized that assistance needed to be provided to LDCs on a sustainable basis so as to have a lasting impact. The LDCs hoped that the WTO would continue to be flexible in the application of the PLS so as to facilitate the participation of officials from LDCs in various training programmes. He also requested that LDCs be considered as venues for Regional Trade Policy Courses (RTPCs), since this would foster long-term institutional capacity and knowledge in the host countries.","WTCOMTDM91.pdf","Uganda, LDC, Group, WTO, LDCs, WTO, LDCs, Doha, Round, WTO, TA, Trade, Development, Facility, WTO, LDCs, WTO"

In this light, the LDCs wished to request that the internship programmes fund at least one official from each LDC Member every year. Turning to national TA activities, he noted that the LDCs' utilization rate remained low. This was due to various reasons, including the costs related to the organization of such events. He urged donors to give positive consideration to this problem and earmark funds so as to allow more national activities to be held in LDCs. He also asked the Secretariat to take note of this request. Finally, he stressed the importance of the Advanced Course for LDCs. He indicated that the LDCs wanted at least one such course to be held each year, as they would continue to require specialized training in evolving areas of the WTO's work.","WTCOMTDM91.pdf","WTO, LDCs, LDC, Member, Secretariat, WTO"

Appreciation was expressed for the recent RTPC that had been held for the Caribbean region, and for the opening of some activities for Geneva-based delegates. She also requested that, while continuing with the value-for-money approach, consideration be given to maintain programmes that were of critical importance to small states.

The proposal was for the Secretariat to prepare an update to its document on the implementation of special and differential treatment (S&D) provisions in the WTO Agreements and Decisions. The updated Secretariat paper was circulated in June 2013 in document WT/COMTD/W/196 and had appeared on the CTD's agenda for a number of meetings. With regard to the remaining proposals contained in documents WT/COMTD/W/192 and WT/COMTD/W/202, he said that he had recently held informal consultations with some Members to explore what progress could be made. He believed that the discussions in the informal consultations had been constructive. It was his understanding that the proponents of the two submissions intended to explore whether they could possibly combine their ideas for the CTD to report on development work in the WTO, so as to come up with a single proposal on this matter. With regard to the other remaining proposal contained in document WT/COMTD/W/192, which was for the CTD to make a recommendation for parties to RTAs to submit their notification and information requirements jointly, he said that he had encouraged the proponents of this proposal to continue their consultations with Members. He invited the proponents to brief the Committee on the status of the remaining proposals in the two submissions.","WTCOMTDM91.pdf","Chairman, Committee, Secretariat, WTO, Secretariat, CTD, Members, CTD, WTO, CTD, Members, Committee"

The representative of Lesotho noted the similarities in the two proposals for the CTD to report on development work in the WTO and indicated that consultations were currently taking place among Members on these proposals.

"10573",10573,"25","25.       The representative of Ecuador said that the proposal in document WT/COMTD/W/204 had initially been made during his delegation's intervention at the 90th Session. The proposal had subsequently been circulated as a CTD document in response to requests from Members. The rationale for the proposal was similar to that of an earlier proposal submitted by Ecuador in June 2012 in document WT/COMTD/W/188. The difference was that, in the new proposal, the Secretariat was being asked to regularly update - at least once a year - its document on the implementation of S&D provisions in the WTO Agreements and Decisions. He said that S&D was one of the pillars of the multilateral trading system, and had been crucial in ensuring balanced negotiations in the Uruguay Round. Furthermore, the CTD had a mandate to review S&D provisions, as laid out in paragraph 3 of its terms of reference. He believed that it was important        1          The discussion concerning documents WT/COMTD/W/192 and WT/COMTD/W/202 is presented together in this Note, since the Chairman's intervention and the subsequent intervention by Lesotho related to both submissions.

"10574",10574,"26","26.      He went on to say that the proposal did not overlap with the Monitoring Mechanism (MM) on S&D, which had been established at MC9 by a Ministerial Decision contained in documents WT/MIN(13)/45 and WT/L/920. According to paragraph 4 of this Decision, the MM would review all aspects of implementation of S&D provisions with a view to facilitating the integration of developing and least-developed Members into the multilateral trading system. The purpose of the MM was to identify problems relating to the application or substance of specific provisions that posed structural or implementation problems. Its work would be carried out mainly on the basis of written inputs or submissions by Members. On the other hand, the Secretariat document referred to in Ecuador's proposal was intended to provide Members with a general overview of the application of S&D. In addition to providing information on the implementation of S&D provisions, the document could serve as a basis for Members' written inputs or submissions under the MM.","WTCOMTDM91.pdf","S&D, Members, Members, Secretariat, Ecuador, Members, Members"

"10576",10576,"28","28.      The representative of the European Union appreciated the usefulness of the Secretariat document on the implementation of S&D provisions, and the need for the paper to be updated periodically. However, she wondered whether there would be sufficient developments to warrant annual updates to the document. She also observed in this connection that there had not been much discussion on the most recent update, which had been prepared in 2013. Noting that the Secretariat document was detailed and technical in nature, she inquired how Ecuador envisaged the document serving as the basis for a general discussion. Finally, she noted that the proposal called for the Secretariat document to include an objective and analytical listing of S&D provisions, identifying the measures that had been taken and put forward to operationalize them. In this light, she asked whether Ecuador was satisfied with the way in which information on the implementation of S&D provisions was provided in the current version of the Secretariat paper.","WTCOMTDM91.pdf","European, Union, Secretariat, Secretariat, Ecuador, Secretariat, Ecuador, Secretariat"
"10577",10577,"29","29.     The representative of the United States, referring to the proposed frequency of the updates to the Secretariat document, questioned whether developments warranting an update could be reasonably expected on a yearly basis. He also asked for further clarification as to how the new proposal by Ecuador differed from the proposal that had been made in 2012. He additionally observed that there appeared to be similarities between the work of the MM and the work proposed by Ecuador, in particular since the MM was mandated to review all aspects of implementation of S&D provisions.","WTCOMTDM91.pdf","United, States, Secretariat, Ecuador, Ecuador"

"10586",10586,"37","37.     In his presentation, the representative of the Development Division gave some background to the Post-2015 Development Agenda. He said that the UN's Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) Summit in 2010 had launched a discussion on what action needed to be taken by the international community to build on the MDGs. Follow-up work took place at the Rio+20 Conference on Sustainable Development in 2012, which subsequently led to the creation of an Open Working Group (OWG) on the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Also in 2012, the UN Secretary-General established a Task Team on the Post-2015 Development Agenda, which was led by the Department of Economic and Social Affairs and included more than 50 UN agencies. The International Monetary Fund, the World Bank and the WTO were invited to participate. In a report issued in May 2013, a High-level Panel of Eminent Persons on the Post-2015 Development Agenda had provided recommendations to the Secretary-General. Subsequently, at the 2013 General Assembly, a High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development was established to monitor the transition from the MDGs to the SDGs. National, regional and global thematic consultations had since been held, led by the UN Development Group. He gave examples of several UN processes and outcomes that would feed into the 2015 General Assembly, where the SDGs would be launched. These included the outcomes of the Fourth UN Conference on LDCs, the Third International Conference on Small Island Developing States, the Second UN Conference on Landlocked Developing Countries, and the Third International Conference on Financing for Development.","WTCOMTDM91.pdf","Development, Division, UN, UN, Department, of, Economic, and, Social, Affairs, UN, International, Monetary, Fund, World, Bank, WTO, General, Assembly, UN, Development, Group, UN, General, Assembly, UN, Conference, Small, Island, Developing, States, UN, Conference"
"10587",10587,"38","38.      The presentation by the representative of the Trade and Environment Division provided information on the process to develop the SDGs, and on the trade components of the SDGs. She recalled that, at the Rio+20 Conference, the importance and utility of a set of SDGs had been recognized. Some functions and criteria of the SDGs had also been laid out. She identified two phases in the development of the SDGs after the Rio+20 Conference. The first phase, which started with the establishment of the OWG in January 2013 and which was completed in February 2014, was concerned with a stock-taking exercise. The second phase focused on the preparation of a report. With regard to the report, she said that a revision to the ""zero draft"" had been circulated on 30 June 2014. The revision contained 17 proposed goals and 150 targets. The draft trade text could be found under proposed goal 17, which related to strengthening the means of implementation and the global partnership for sustainable development. There were three targets under this proposed goal. The first target was to promote a universal, rules-based, open, non-discriminatory and equitable multilateral trading system. The second target was concerned with improving market access for the exports of developing countries, while the third called for the timely implementation of duty-free and quota-free (DFQF) market access on a lasting basis for all LDCs. She added that some trade-related targets could be found under other proposed goals as well. In concluding, she informed Members that the intention was for the report to be finalized and submitted to the General Assembly by September.","WTCOMTDM91.pdf","Trade, and, Environment, Division, OWG, Members, General, Assembly"

He went on to say that there remained one RTA notified under the Enabling Clause that had not been ratified by all the parties. This was the Pacific Island Countries Trade Agreement (PICTA).

He informed the Committee that he had held some informal consultations with a number of delegations, including on an individual basis, on the issues surrounding the three listed sub-items. While these consultations had helped him to better understand Members' positions, it was clear that further discussions - particularly among the concerned delegations - would be necessary before a solution could be found. In this light, he encouraged delegations to reach out to each other and discuss the matter with a view to finding a solution. He also indicated that he would continue his informal consultations with Members.        -    Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) notification of Customs Union – communication from             China, Egypt and India (WT/COMTD/W/175)","WTCOMTDM91.pdf","Chairman, CTD, Committee, Members, Members, Gulf, Cooperation, Council, GCC, Customs, Union, China, Egypt, India"

"10598",10598,"48","48.     He said that there was a divergence of views as to whether the GCC Customs Union was a case of a dual notification. His delegation believed that the GCC Customs Union issue was not an issue of dual notification, and was therefore different from the discussion relating to the ASEAN-Korea Agreement and the India-Korea Agreement. The US remained of the view that the GCC Customs Union had been incorrectly notified under the Enabling Clause. This was subsequently corrected, and the understanding of his delegation was that the GCC Customs Union was in the pipeline to be considered in the CRTA in line with the procedures of the RTAs TM. The US considered this issue closed and continued to request that the present sub-item be removed from the CTD's agenda, as it had served its purpose. Turning to document WT/COMTD/W/175, he said that his delegation had not seen any specific issues relating to the GCC Customs Union. Rather, the paper appeared to be seeking a systemic discussion on RTAs, which was a discussion that was outside the scope of the CTD and belonged in the Negotiating Group on Rules (NGR).

The question of when the NGR would meet to discuss RTA issues was separate and distinct from the question of whether it had jurisdiction on this matter, which the US believed it did. He also indicated that the first three sub-items had fulfilled their purpose of informing Members of the notifications made, and these sub-items were distinct from the systemic discussion that some delegations wanted to have.

He went on to say that his delegation had noted a concerted effort to dilute and undermine the Enabling Clause - not only in deliberations in the CTD, but also in the CRTA, the NGR and other WTO bodies. Such efforts to chip away at the Enabling Clause were not new. In the context of RTA notifications, it dated back to 2002, when India and Sri Lanka had notified their bilateral free trade agreement under the Enabling Clause. During the consideration process in the CTD, a developed country Member had questioned whether the notification was to be made to the CTD or the CRTA, even though both India and Sri Lanka were developing countries and had a prerogative to notify their RTA under the Enabling Clause. He expressed his delegation's concern that a similar position was once again being taken by some Members, which questioned the notification of the GCC Customs Union under the Enabling Clause and stated that it had been incorrectly notified. He also stressed the urgency of addressing the issues relating to the three ""dually notified"" RTAs as soon as possible. In closing, he expressed support for the intervention by Egypt, and requested that the three sub-items under the present agenda item be retained on the agenda for the next CTD meeting.","WTCOMTDM91.pdf","GATT, China, Egypt, India, CTD, CRTA, WTO, RTA, India, Sri, Lanka, CTD, Member, CTD, CRTA, India, Sri, Lanka, RTA, Members, GCC, Customs, Union, Egypt, CTD"

He explained that, while the US had no quarrel with any developing country notifying a qualifying agreement under the Enabling Clause, not all RTAs qualified under the Enabling Clause. To maintain otherwise would make a mockery of the Enabling Clause and basic statutory interpretation.","WTCOMTDM91.pdf","United, States, US, GCC, Customs, Union, GATT, CRTA, US, GCC, Customs, Union, India, Members, US"

The Chairman said that he wished to provide Members with a brief update on the preferential trade arrangements (PTAs) that were to be considered in the CTD's Dedicated Sessions on PTAs. He firstly informed the Committee that Chile had notified its DFQF scheme for LDCs on 10 April 2014 in document WT/COMTD/N/44. Chile had also subsequently circulated in document WT/COMTD/N/44/Add.1 the Certificate of Origin concerning the DFQF scheme.

The Chairman said that the TM for PTAs was being implemented by the CTD, as per the provisions contained in document WT/L/806, which was the General Council Decision of 14 December 2010 which established the Mechanism. He recalled that, at the 90th Session, he had brought to Members' attention paragraph 26 of the TM for PTAs, which indicated that the Mechanism would apply on a provisional basis until Members approved its permanent application. The paragraph also indicated that Members would review the Mechanism after three years and if necessary modify the Mechanism in light of the experience gained from its provisional operation. He went on to say that three years had elapsed since the General Council Decision which established the PTAs TM. Members would, therefore, need to consider the question of the review of the Mechanism. Whether enough experience had been gained yet to conduct a review would also be for Members to determine. He informed the Committee that he intended to hold informal consultations to hear views concerning the timing and the nature of a review of the PTAs TM.","WTCOMTDM91.pdf","Chairman, CTD, General, Council, Decision, Members, Members, Members, General, Council, Decision, Members, Members, Committee"

The understanding of the LDCs was that the scheme was comprehensive and covered more than 97% of tariff lines. The LDCs commended those Members that had already attained the 97% mark and encouraged others to do so as well. It was important for preference-granting countries to fulfill the notification requirements and make available the utilization rates in their DFQF schemes. The LDCs had taken note of the notifications made by various developed and developing countries and encouraged Members to provide DFQF market access for all products originating from LDCs in a manner that ensured stability, security and predictability. It was essential that developed countries ensured that products of commercial interest to LDCs were effectively included in their schemes. He also noted that Chile had circulated a communication on the rules of origin requirements and expressed hope that the requirements would be simple in order to facilitate LDCs' exports. He stressed the importance of rules of origin in DFQF schemes and called on Members to make their rules of origin transparent, simple and objective, in line with the guidelines agreed to by Ministers at MC9.","WTCOMTDM91.pdf","Uganda, LDC, Group, Chile, LDCs, LDCs, Members, LDCs, Members, LDCs, LDCs, Chile, Members"

He informed the Committee that, according to this paragraph, at the end of the implementation period of an RTA, the parties were to submit to the WTO a short, written report on the realization of the liberalization commitments in the RTA as originally notified. He understood that a discussion on the issue of implementation reports had been taking place in the CRTA, and a list had been circulated in document WT/REG/W/82 of RTAs notified under GATT Article XXIV and GATS Article V that were subject to implementation reports.","WTCOMTDM91.pdf","Chairman, Committee, RTA, WTO, RTA, CRTA, GATT"

In this light, he said that he had requested the Secretariat to prepare an updated list of RTAs notified under the Enabling Clause that were subject to implementation reports. He invited Members to consult the list, which would be circulated as a CTD document, and inform the Secretariat of any inaccuracies. He also called on Members to submit the required implementation reports. For some possible guidance on format, he referred Members to document JOB/REG/5 - which contained a mock report on the EU-Chile Agreement that would shortly be circulated in the CRTA as a formal report - as well as documents JOB/REG/1 and JOB/REG/4 that had been circulated by the Secretariat. He noted, however, that since the purpose of the implementation reports was to increase transparency on each Agreement's implementation, form was less important than substance. Therefore, as would be the case in the CRTA, he called on Members to submit the reports to the CTD in the format that they saw fit.","WTCOMTDM91.pdf","Members, CRTA, CTD, Secretariat, Members, CTD, Secretariat, Members, Members, CRTA, Secretariat, CRTA, Members, CTD"

She said in this regard that the WTO had been able to maintain the implementation of activities at the same level as 2012. Close to 14,000 participants were trained in 2013, which was an increase of 9% relative to 2012. A total of 45% of the participants were women. She also noted that sufficient funds had been available to implement activities in 2013. Even though the funds due for 2013 had been received in the last quarter of the year, there had been a significant carryover from 2012 of CHF 12.4 million. She informed the Committee that the annual report on TA activities undertaken in 2013 would be presented to Members at the next CTD meeting.","WTCOMTDM91.pdf","Director, ITTC, WTO, Committee, Members"

Moving on to the status of the DDAGTF, she said that the WTO had multi-year agreements with a number of donors - Australia, Canada, Denmark, France, the Netherlands and Norway - which helped to ensure predictability in the financing of TA activities. There was a balance of CHF 18 million in the DDAGTF at the start of 2014. As of the end of May, the balance was estimated to be CHF 11.8 million, after taking into account expenditures, commitments and pending activities. Based on the present implementation rate and taking into account the anticipated activities in the coming months, it was expected that approximately CHF 10 million would be spent in 2014, representing an increase of 20% relative to 2012. In the absence of additional contributions, this would leave a balance of approximately CHF 7 million to be carried forward to 2015. This amount would be sufficient to implement activities in the first half of 2015, but contributions would be required in the second half of the year to ensure the full implementation of the planned activities for 2015 that were reflected in the current biennial TA Plan. She said that similar information had been provided to Members at the recent meeting of the Committee on Budget, Finance and Administration.","WTCOMTDM91.pdf","WTO, Australia, Canada, Denmark, France, Netherlands, Norway, Members, Committee, on, Budget, ,, Finance, and, Administration"

He noted in this regard that all developed Members, with the exception of the US, granted full - or almost full - DFQF market access to LDCs' products. Table 1 of the Secretariat report indicated that the DFQF coverage in the US' GSP scheme was 82.6%, which was almost 15 percentage points below the minimum for developed countries mentioned in the Hong Kong Decision. Furthermore, the US' GSP scheme had expired on 31 July 2013, and many imports from LDCs that would otherwise have received duty-free treatment were subject to most-favoured-nation (MFN) tariffs. He indicated that he wished to refer to information contained in Volume XXIX, Number 42, of the Washington Trade Report dated 11 November 2013. He noted in this regard that the LDCs, as a group, were subject to higher average tariffs than other US trading partners. The LDCs to which the US extended the closest approximation of DFQF treatment were either in the Americas or in Sub-Saharan Africa, while those located in Asia and the Pacific were granted only limited preferences. He referred next to a Congressional Research Service report titled “African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA): Background and Reauthorization”, dated 24 July 2014. This report indicated that LDCs throughout the world faced relatively high US import tariffs given the particular items they exported, such as apparel and agricultural products. For example, in 2013, US import duties on all imports from Cambodia were higher than those from France. In concluding, he said that India welcomed                                            WT/COMTD/M/92                                                  - 17 - feedback from the LDCs that would help to iron out any difficulties they faced in taking advantage of the DFTP Scheme.","WTCOMTDM92.pdf","Members, US, Secretariat, US, Hong, Kong, US, GSP, MFN, Washington, US, LDCs, US, Americas, Sub-Saharan, Africa, Asia, Pacific, Congressional, Research, Service, LDCs, US, US, Cambodia, France, India, LDCs"

The organization would continue to invest in people, processes and methodologies, and would continue to invest in upgrading skills around core areas such as project cycle management and impact assessment. With regard to improving its internal processes, the organization had invested a considerable amount of effort in moving to more automated ways of working, cutting down on non-essential procedures and enhancing interfaces. For example, the time required to recruit staff                                           WT/COMTD/M/92                                                 -4- and consultants had been cut down, and a new integrated project portal was being enhanced with the aim of simplifying project management functions and creating necessary linkages within the organization. She added that the ITC remained committed to improving governance and accountability, and was implementing a full accountability framework, in conjunction with the UN’s Office of Internal Oversight Services. The organization was also developing a robust risk management framework, and was additionally advancing on a costing exercise that would provide a better sense of where investments could be maximized. Furthermore, the organization recognized the changing demands and dynamics in beneficiary countries, and therefore the need to ensure that the ITC's responses remained relevant. In this regard, she highlighted the importance of facilitating innovation through exposure to the latest techniques and thinking. She explained that the vision was for the ITC to become a thought leader in its area of specialization, which was SME competitiveness. Finally, she informed the Committee that the ITC's World Export Development Forum and the Women Vendors Exhibition and Forum were successfully held in Rwanda in September 2014 with participants from over 70 countries.","WTCOMTDM92.pdf","ITC, ITC, UN, Office, of, Internal, Oversight, Services, ITC, ITC, Committee, ITC, Rwanda"

The main content of the report had already been presented by the Institute for Training and Technical Cooperation (ITTC) at the informal, open-ended CTD meeting that was held on 6 November 2014. The report was on the agenda of the present meeting to allow the Committee to formally take note of it.

The Director of the ITTC said that, for the first time, the annual report presented an analysis of the technical assistance (TA) activities together with an assessment of the results. It was hoped that Members would find the format of the report useful. She began her presentation by informing the Committee that, in 2013, the ITTC had continued with a tight management of TA resources, in line with the need to do more with less. While efforts were made to operationalize the TA monitoring and evaluation online system, the system had not been completed due, inter alia, to limited resources.","WTCOMTDM92.pdf","Director, ITTC, Members, Committee, ITTC"
"10654",10654,"15","15.    Turning to the implementation of planned TA activities, she said that 279 activities had been organized. This figure excluded the Secretariat's participation in conferences and similar activities. While an increase in national activities had been observed in 2013, there was a slight reduction in the number of regional activities, due partly to the increase in e-learning courses. The organization of the Ninth Ministerial Conference (MC9) in December 2013 had also contributed to the observed reduction in regional activities. She said that the Secretariat had worked to enhance the substantive content of the courses in an effort to better tailor activities to the needs of beneficiaries. As an example, she pointed to the benchmarks in the Progressive Learning Strategy (PLS) that had been developed. She also noted that exams had been introduced in all the regional trade policy courses (RTPCs), while case study training had been introduced in the advanced trade policy courses. LDCs remained a priority in TA activities, and an increase in LDC participation had been observed. Global activities represented about 30% of the total. Africa had the highest number of activities at the regional level, followed by the Asia-Pacific region. With the exception of the Middle East, TA activities were predominately delivered at the national level. A total of 13,734 individuals were trained, which was an increase of 9% from the previous year. About 40% of the participants followed e-learning courses, representing slightly over 5% of the total cost. A total of 47 trainees had benefited from the internship programme, which was an increase of 15%. In terms of the gender mix, 44% of the participants in the face-to-face activities were women.","WTCOMTDM92.pdf","Secretariat, Secretariat, Progressive, Learning, Strategy, LDCs, Africa, Asia-Pacific, Middle, East"

Finally, with regard to the achievement of results, she said that the rate of success in achieving immediate results was high, as 97% of the set objectives in the training activities were achieved. However, the measurement of long term results was more difficult, given that the RBM online system was not being implemented yet. She noted, however, that the ITTC had conducted an ex-post evaluation of the advanced sanitary and phytosanitary measures (SPS) training                                          WT/COMTD/M/92                                                 -5- programme, which revealed that the programme had met its objectives and made a significant contribution to the better implementation of the SPS Agreement in the countries concerned. The programme had also created a pool of SPS experts in beneficiary countries. Finally, she informed the Committee that the annual report listed a number of recommendations which were based on the lessons learned during the implementation of the TA activities in 2013. These had been taken into consideration in the implementation of activities in 2014.","WTCOMTDM92.pdf","RBM, ITTC, Committee"

He pointed as an example to the enhancement of e-learning opportunities, which had led to an increase in the number of chat sessions and e-learning courses offered. He observed that e-learning would allow more participants to take advantage of the assistance offered. He also noted that it was mentioned in the report that the participants in e-learning courses were asked to take an exam to measure the results of the training. The report went on to state that exams would be introduced in all relevant trade-related TA activities. In this regard, he said that his delegation looked forward to learning more about efforts to measure the impact of courses.","WTCOMTDM92.pdf","United, States, ITTC, WTO"

He noted that not all participants were able to reach and complete the advanced level of the PLS, and in this light called on the ITTC to do more to ensure a higher completion rate. He also suggested that efforts could be made to improve participants' overall performance. In addition, he noted that the francophone participants were performing less well than others, and suggested that this matter needed be addressed.","WTCOMTDM92.pdf","Cameroon"

He believed that the LDCs' participation in intermediate and advanced levels courses would help them to formulate better trade policies and participate effectively in WTO activities. The LDCs hoped that the WTO would continue to be flexible in the application of the PLS so as to facilitate their participation in various training programmes. He indicated that attention was required to the question of how long-term institutional capacity and knowledge in LDCs could be fostered. A possible avenue would be to consider an LDC as a venue for an RTPC, as this would increase human and institutional capacity in the LDC. It would also enhance collaboration between LDC academic institutions and the WTO. He requested Members to consider LDCs as venues for future RTPCs. He also emphasized the benefits to LDCs of the WTO internship programmes and in this light requested that these programmes fund at least one official from each LDC Member each year. Noting that LDCs' rate of utilization of their entitlement for national activities remained low, he said that this was due to various reasons, including the costs related to the organization of such events. He urged donors to give positive consideration to this problem and also asked the Secretariat to take note of the request. He recalled that there was recognition in paragraph 3 of the Doha Ministerial Declaration of the special structural difficulties faced by LDCs.","WTCOMTDM92.pdf","Uganda, LDC, Group, WTO, LDCs, WTO, WTO, Members, WTO, Member, Secretariat"

The purpose of the evaluation was to determine, inter alia, whether the EIF could be extended beyond 2015. The evaluation report had reaffirmed the relevance of the EIF to the LDCs and called for its extension. However, it had also highlighted the difficulty in addressing a funding gap of approximately US$50 million. The LDCs' view was that this could be easily overcome with the requisite political will, and in this light they called for a timely decision to extend the EIF and for the necessary funds to be delivered.

The purpose was not for Members to enter into in-depth discussions on specific S&D provisions. In addition, he had pointed out that the regularly updated Secretariat paper could serve as an input to inform the discussions that would take place in the context of the Monitoring Mechanism (MM) on S&D.

He explained that Ecuador's proposal called for regular updates to a Secretariat paper which contained information on the implementation of the full range of S&D provisions in the WTO Agreements and Decisions. Since S&D was one of the key elements for achieving the WTO's development objectives, his delegation believed that the comprehensive information provided in the Secretariat document would assist Members in periodically discussing and assessing the general state of S&D implementation.

While stressing the importance of S&D for LDCs, he also noted that the utilization and implementation of S&D provisions was often weak with respect to LDCs, and therefore inadequate to address the real challenges faced by these countries. Many S&D provisions were non-binding. He expressed regret that, despite strong calls from Ministers at the Doha Ministerial Conference to address S&D issues, Members had not been able to conclude the negotiations mandated in paragraph 44 of the Doha Declaration. He informed the Committee that, for the last few months, the LDCs had been analyzing and reviewing the LDC-specific S&D provisions with a view to making them more precise, effective and operational, as per the Doha mandate. While the intention had been to complete the exercise before the end of 2014, the work was taking longer than had been initially envisaged, due to the complexity of the subject matter. He expressed his hope that a submission could be made in the Special Session of the CTD in early 2015, and that Members would give the submission positive consideration. The LDCs also looked forward to working closely with other groups within the WTO to advance negotiations in this area.","WTCOMTDM92.pdf","Nepal, Secretariat, Members, S&D, for, LDCs, Members, Committee, LDCs, Doha, CTD, Members, LDCs, WTO"

He noted that, at the CTD's 2nd Dedicated Session on the MM, some Members had indicated that they working on written submissions for the MM. In this light, he suggested that the Committee postpone its consideration of Ecuador's proposal until Members had had the opportunity to have a discussion on the proposals made in the context of the MM.

"10697",10697,"54","54.    The Chairman recalled that, at the 91st Session, the Secretariat had provided a briefing on the discussions taking place at the UN on the Post-2015 Development Agenda. He had also subsequently raised this issue at the informal, open-ended CTD meeting held on 6 November 2014. The objective was to keep Members updated on the discussions, while also guiding the Secretariat - which was frequently invited to participate in these deliberations - on how Members wished to see trade reflected in the Post-2015 Development Agenda. He went on to say that a main focus at present was on the how the UN Secretary General's Synthesis Report, which was to be issued shortly, would capture progress made in the various inter-governmental processes feeding into the 2015 Summit. The Summit would coincide with the UN's 70th General Assembly, and would officially launch the Post-2015 Development Agenda and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). A draft resolution at the General Assembly had confirmed that the set of 17 SDGs would provide the main basis for the Post-2015 Development Agenda. Trade was reflected in Goal 17, which was to strengthen both the implementation of the goals and the global partnership for sustainable development. Goal 17 currently contained three targets that were directly trade-related. These targets called for the promotion of a universal, rules-based, open, non-discriminatory and equitable multilateral trading system; improved market access for exports of developing countries with a view to increasing their share of world trade; and the implementation of duty-free and quota-free (DFQF) market access on a lasting basis for all LDCs.","WTCOMTDM92.pdf","Chairman, Secretariat, UN, Members, Secretariat, Members, UN, UN, 70th, General, Assembly, General, Assembly"
"10698",10698,"55","55.   In concluding, he said that it remained his hope that Members would be able to identify elements of the Post-2015 Development Agenda that could be incorporated into the CTD's work. In his view, the CTD's mandate from MC8 was an appropriate entry point for this purpose. He encouraged Members to continue to give some thought to this matter and to share their thoughts                                          WT/COMTD/M/92                                                - 10 - on how trade-led economic growth could be made an integral part of the Post-2015 Development Agenda, so that the Secretariat could reflect these views in its presentations to the UN. He believed that he spoke for all Members when emphasizing the importance of having a strong trade component incorporated into the Post-2015 Development Agenda, in light of the value Members attached to trade-led growth and development.","WTCOMTDM92.pdf","Members, CTD, CTD, Members, Secretariat, UN, Members, Members"

He went on to say that there remained one RTA notified under the Enabling Clause that had not been ratified by all the parties. This was the Pacific Island Countries Trade Agreement (PICTA). Following the procedures of the Committee on Regional Trade Agreements (CRTA), a factual presentation of an RTA falling in this category would only be drafted after the agreement had been ratified by all the parties.

He also indicated that he wished to say a few words regarding the implementation reports that were required under paragraph 15 of the Transparency Mechanism (TM) for RTAs, in follow-up to his intervention at the 91st Session. He said that, according to this paragraph, at the end of the implementation period of an RTA, the parties were to submit to the WTO a short written report on the realization of the liberalization commitments in the RTA as originally notified. He recalled that he had mentioned at the 91st Session that a discussion on the issue of implementation reports had been taking place in the CRTA, and that a list had been circulated in document WT/REG/W/82 of RTAs notified under GATT Article XXIV and GATS Article V that were subject to implementation reports. He had shared his belief that it was in Members' interests to continue to maintain similar procedures between the CRTA and the CTD when it came to implementing the RTAs TM, and in this light he had informed the Committee that the Secretariat would prepare an updated list of RTAs notified under the Enabling Clause that were subject to implementation reports.","WTCOMTDM92.pdf","RTA, WTO, RTA, CRTA, GATT, Members, CRTA, CTD, Committee, Secretariat"

For some possible guidance on format, he referred Members to the report on the EU-Chile Agreement which had been circulated in the CRTA in document WT/REG/164/R/I. He also referred Members to documents JOB/REG/1 and JOB/REG/4 which had been circulated by the Secretariat. He noted, however, that since the purpose of these implementation reports was to increase transparency on each Agreement's implementation, form was less important than substance. Therefore, as would be the case in the CRTA, he called on Members to submit reports to the CTD in the format that they saw fit.","WTCOMTDM92.pdf","Secretariat, Members, Secretariat, Members, Members, CRTA, Members, Secretariat, CRTA, Members, CTD"

He noted that these sub-items had been appearing on the CTD's agenda for several years, and that divergent views had been expressed on the way forward. He informed the Committee that he had held some informal consultations with a number of delegations, including on an individual basis, on the issues surrounding the three sub-items. While these consultations had helped him to better understand Members' positions, it was clear that further discussions - particularly among the concerned delegations - would be necessary before a solution could be found. In this light, he encouraged delegations to reach out to each other and discuss the matter with a view to finding a solution. He also indicated that he would continue his informal consultations with Members.            -   Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) notification of Customs Union – communication from                China, Egypt and India (WT/COMTD/W/175)","WTCOMTDM92.pdf","Chairman, CTD, Committee, Members, Members, Gulf, Cooperation, Council, GCC, Customs, Union, China, Egypt, India"

"10710",10710,"66","66.    He said that there was a divergence of views as to whether the GCC Customs Union was a case of a dual notification. His delegation believed that the GCC Customs Union issue was not an issue of dual notification, and was therefore different from the discussion relating to the ASEAN-Korea Agreement and the India-Korea Agreement. The US remained of the view that the GCC Customs Union had been incorrectly notified under the Enabling Clause. This was subsequently corrected, and the understanding of his delegation was that the GCC Customs Union was in the pipeline to be considered in the CRTA in line with the procedures of the RTAs TM. The US considered this issue closed and continued to request that the present sub-item be removed from the CTD's agenda, as it had served its purpose. Turning to document WT/COMTD/W/175, he said that his delegation had not seen any specific issues relating to the GCC Customs Union. Rather, the paper appeared to be seeking a systemic discussion on RTAs, which was a discussion that was outside the scope of the CTD and belonged in the Negotiating Group on Rules (NGR). He indicated that the US was not open to a CTD process to discuss systemic issues concerning RTAs. The question of when the NGR would meet to discuss RTA issues was separate and distinct from the question of whether it had jurisdiction on this matter, which the US believed it did. He also indicated that the first three sub-items had fulfilled their purpose of informing Members of the notifications made, and these sub-items were distinct from the systemic discussion that some delegations wanted to have. The US did not believe that the CTD was the appropriate forum for a discussion on a systemic issue that cut across Committees.2","WTCOMTDM92.pdf","GCC, Customs, Union, GCC, Customs, Union, US, GCC, Customs, Union, GCC, Customs, Union, CRTA, US, CTD, GCC, Customs, Union, CTD, US, CTD, RTA, US, Members, US, CTD"

The representative of Egypt said that systemic concerns had been raised by some Members, including Egypt, over the legal and procedural implications of the dual notification of the GCC Customs Union under both the Enabling Clause and GATT Article XXIV. He noted that a number of delegations had previously expressed the view that the Enabling Clause did not provide the appropriate legal basis to justify the formation of a customs union involving the reduction or elimination of non-tariff measures (NTMs). However, others had argued that the non-prescription of criteria or conditions for the elimination of NTMs did not exclude customs unions among developing countries from the coverage of the Enabling Clause. The view of his delegation was that the CTD was the appropriate forum to consider the questions arising from RTAs with a dual notification. This originated from the CTD's terms of reference, which stipulated that the CTD was the focal point for the consideration and coordination of work on development in the WTO. In addition, paragraph 4 of the terms of reference mandated the CTD to consider any questions with regard to either the application or the use of special provisions in the Multilateral Trade Agreements and related Ministerial Decisions in favour of developing country Members, which included questions relating to the invocation of the Enabling Clause to notify customs unions among developing countries.

The representative of the European Union said that she wished to reiterate the EU's view that the purpose of the present agenda item was to inform Members of new notifications under the Enabling Clause since the previous CTD meeting. While her delegation welcomed any ideas for a pragmatic solution to the present impasse, she indicated that a more substantive discussion on the legal issues arising from RTAs with a dual notification needed to take place in the NGR.

As of 1 January 2015, countries that were classified as high income or upper-middle income, or which were trade-competitive, would no longer receive the GPT. This would affect 72 countries. The changes would ensure that the benefits of Canada’s GSP scheme were targeted towards those in most need of assistance, particularly LDCs. With this in mind, consequential changes would come into effect for the rules of origin for the LDCT so that LDCs’ preferential access to the Canadian market was not impacted by the GPT changes. LDCs would continue to benefit from the same liberal access that they had enjoyed in the Canadian market since 2003, by being allowed to use the same sources of supply in the production of goods eligible for duty-free treatment.

"10734",10734,"88","88.    The Chairman recalled that, in previous CTD meetings, he had brought to Members' attention paragraph 26 of the TM for PTAs, which indicated that the Mechanism would apply on a provisional basis until Members approved its permanent application. The paragraph also indicated that Members would review the Mechanism after three years, and if necessary modify the Mechanism in light of the experience gained from its provisional operation. He went on to say that more than three years had elapsed since the General Council Decision which established the PTAs TM. Members would, therefore, need to consider the question of the review of the Mechanism. He recalled that, at the informal, open-ended CTD meeting held on 6 November 2014, he had provided an overview of the status of implementation of the PTAs TM, so as to assist Members in considering this question. He indicated that he would repeat the elements of this overview at the present meeting, for the benefit of all Members.","WTCOMTDM92.pdf","Chairman, Members, Members, Members, General, Council, Decision, Members, Members, Members"
"10735",10735,"89","89.    By way of introduction, he said that the implementation of the PTAs TM had taken place in the CTD on the basis of the General Council Decision of December 2010, complemented by the modalities to implement the Mechanism that the Committee agreed to at its 82nd Session on 5 July 2011. Turning to some specifics, he said that he would firstly address the notifications of PTAs under paragraph 1 of the Mechanism. For PTAs notified under this paragraph since the establishment of the Mechanism - and in particular under one of the three sub-paragraphs of this paragraph - a factual presentation by the Secretariat was to be prepared, on the basis of data and information provided by the notifying Member implementing the PTA. The PTA was to be considered in a Dedicated Session of the CTD, on the basis of the factual presentation, as well as written questions from Members and replies from the notifying Member. While six PTAs had thus far been notified under paragraph 1 of the Mechanism, only one had been considered by the Committee. This was the EU's trade preferences for Pakistan, which was considered in April 2014 at the CTD's 1st Dedicated Session on PTAs. With regard to the five other PTAs, he recalled that he had already provided an update under the previous agenda item. Essentially, for four of them, the full set of data required for the preparation of the factual presentations had not been provided to the Secretariat.","WTCOMTDM92.pdf","CTD, General, Council, Decision, Committee, Secretariat, Member, PTA, PTA, CTD, Members, Member, Committee, EU, Pakistan, CTD, Secretariat"
"10736",10736,"9","9.      She added that, at the 48th JAG Session, the results of the recent independent evaluation of the ITC were presented. The evaluators recognized that, since the last evaluation of the organization in 2006, the ITC had made progress in improving the delivery of its mandate and its internal management procedures. There were no instances of regression on recommendations made in the 2006 evaluation. The new evaluation underlined the ITC’s continued relevance and the growing demand for its services, and noted that the organization, with its strengthened management and technical expertise, was well placed to respond to the demand. The evaluation also pointed to a number of challenges, such as embedding results-based management (RBM) in all of the ITC’s programmes; improving the project management cycle; fine-tuning frameworks for needs and risk assessment and accountability; enhancing client relationship management; streamlining internal work processes; and developing a costing process. All of these issues were being addressed by the organization, and the process and timelines in this regard had been set out in the ITC management response to the evaluation. The evaluation also noted that, for the ITC to be able to fully address all the recommendations, there was a need for more stable and predictable funding. It was agreed that the JAG would reconvene in informal session in January 2015 to have a more fully informed discussion on the collective response to the evaluation and the progress achieved. Finally, she noted that 2014 marked the ITC’s 50th anniversary, and for this purpose a special publication titled “50 Years of Unlocking SME Competitiveness: Lessons for the Future” had been launched at the JAG.","WTCOMTDM92.pdf","ITC, ITC, ITC, RBM, ITC, ITC, ITC, ITC"
"10737",10737,"90","90.    He went on to say that he also wished to say a few words on the requirements in paragraphs 15 and 16 of the PTAs TM, which concerned all notified PTAs - including those that were notified before the establishment of the Mechanism. Paragraph 15 indicated that changes affecting the implementation of a PTA during a calendar year were to be notified on an annual basis. Changes to be notified include legal changes and changes in the treatment of beneficiaries, including through graduation. According to the modalities to implement the PTAs TM that the CTD agreed to, notifications of this nature were to be circulated as CTD documents. He noted in this regard that there had not been many such notifications to the CTD since the PTAs TM was established. Paragraphs 15 and 16 of the PTAs TM also specified the data that Members implementing PTAs were to submit on an annual basis. These concerned firstly preferential tariffs                                          WT/COMTD/M/92                                                - 15 - per beneficiary partner applied under each PTA, at the tariff line level. Second, Members implementing PTAs were required to submit data concerning imports from each beneficiary partner, including imports entering under PTA benefits, at the tariff-line level. However, while some Members implementing PTAs had submitted up-to-date data, there remained several gaps - especially with regard to data on imports entering under PTA benefits.","WTCOMTDM92.pdf","CTD, Members, PTA, Members, PTA, Members, PTA"
"10738",10738,"91","91.    He observed that, while progress had certainly been made in enhancing transparency in PTAs since the Mechanism was established, there was more that could be done to ensure that the Mechanism was being fully implemented as agreed by Members. He recalled that a Database on PTAs was established as an outcome of the Decision establishing the PTAs TM. This database - which was publicly available through the WTO website - contained various types of documentation relating to the PTAs being implemented by Members, as well as trade and tariff data concerning each PTA. However, the database could only remain up to date if Members submitted up-to-date information and data. In this light, he urged Members implementing PTAs to ensure that they were up to date with their notification and information requirements under the PTAs TM. He invited these Members to remain in touch with the Secretariat after the present meeting to verify the status of their submissions. Finally, with regard to the discussion on the question of the review of the PTAs TM that had taken place at the informal, open-ended meeting of 6 November, he indicated that he saw this as a preliminary discussion. Some ideas were shared on possible ways forward. He also recalled that some Members had raised the question of whether enough experience had yet been gained to conduct a full review of the Mechanism. In conclusion, he expressed his willingness to work with Members to facilitate any further discussions they might wish to have on the question of the review of the PTAs TM.","WTCOMTDM92.pdf","Members, WTO, Members, PTA, Members, Members, Members, Secretariat, Members, Members"

The Chairman said that the Bali Ministerial Decision of 7 December 2013 contained in documents WT/MIN(13)/44 and WT/L/919 instructed the CTD to continue to annually review the steps taken to provide DFQF market access to the LDCs, and report to the General Council for appropriate action. To aid in its review, the Secretariat was to prepare a report, in close coordination with Members, on their DFQF market access for LDCs at the tariff line level, based on their notifications. He said that the Secretariat report was circulated in document WT/COMTD/W/206. The preparation of the report had benefited from discussions with Members in a number of informal consultations.","WTCOMTDM92.pdf","Chairman, Bali, Ministerial, Decision, CTD, General, Council, Secretariat, Members, LDCs, Secretariat, Members"
"10741",10741,"94","94.   The representative of Chinese Taipei said that Chinese Taipei was one of the developing Members that had notified its DFQF scheme to the WTO. She observed that LDCs still faced many challenges with respect to international trade. In this light, she urged other Members to grant DFQF market access to LDCs and to notify the WTO of their DFQF schemes, so as to help the LDCs integrate into the multilateral trading system.","WTCOMTDM92.pdf","Chinese, Taipei, Taipei, Members, WTO, Members, WTO"
"10742",10742,"95","95.    The delegation of Bangladesh indicated that it was not clear from the Secretariat report what steps had been taken by Members since MC9 to provide DFQF market to LDCs. This was a matter that he had raised during the informal consultations. While a few Members were maintaining non-reciprocal preferential schemes, many of these schemes were not specific to LDCs and did not provide benefit to all LDCs. His delegation also noted with disappointment that one Member’s GSP scheme had expired over a year ago. The legally non-binding nature of these schemes was a matter of economic and systemic concern to LDCs. He believed that the information in the Secretariat report was not sufficient to allow Members to effectively review the steps taken to provide DFQF market access to LDCs. The value of the Secretariat report needed to lie in depicting the exclusive DFQF coverage to LDCs in their areas of export interest, at the tariff line level. Such information was necessary to engage in an informed discussion with the objective of recommending ways and means to improve the coverage and utility of DFQF schemes. In this light, he called upon the Secretariat to present the requested information and data at the next CTD meeting. Finally, he noted that DFQF treatment would not be useful to LDCs if the rules of origin in                                            WT/COMTD/M/92                                                  - 16 - the DFQF schemes were burdensome. He believed that the Secretariat report would benefit from the inclusion of information on the rules of origin in the various DFQF schemes.","WTCOMTDM92.pdf","Bangladesh, Secretariat, Members, Members, Member, GSP, Secretariat, Members, Secretariat, Secretariat, Secretariat"

Such cooperation from Members enhanced transparency and further assisted the LDCs in gaining a clear picture of market access opportunities. He also noted with satisfaction that the preparation of the report was evidence of the implementation of one of the LDC-related decisions from MC9. Japan was committed to assisting LDCs in their development and stood ready for active discussions to integrate the LDCs into the multilateral trading system.","WTCOMTDM92.pdf","Japan, Secretariat, Members, WTO, Integrated, Database, Members, LDCs, Japan, LDCs"

"10745",10745,"98","98.    The representative of the United States indicated that the consultations held by the Chairman had allowed the concerns expressed by his delegation on an earlier draft of the Secretariat report to be addressed. He believed that the report was responsive to the Bali DFQF Decision. In this light, he said that, if Bangladesh wished to request additional work from the Secretariat, a written proposal would need to be submitted for Members' consideration. He also suggested that future reports by the Secretariat show Members’ DFQF schemes in a more comprehensive way, in particular by providing information on the number of beneficiaries of each scheme. In the case of the US' schemes, he believed that about eight LDCs were granted DFQF access on 82.6% of tariff lines, while about 25 LDCs were granted DFQF access on 97.5% of tariff lines.","WTCOMTDM92.pdf","United, States, Chairman, Secretariat, Bali, Bangladesh, Secretariat, Members, Secretariat, Members, US"
"10746",10746,"99","99.    The representative of India recalled elements of the decision on DFQF market access for LDCs taken at the Hong Kong Ministerial Conference in December 2005 and said that, pursuant to this decision, India had announced its Duty Free Tariff Preference (DFTP) Scheme for LDCs in 2008. The scheme - which was notified to the WTO in September 2011 - came into full operation in October 2012, with duty-free access to LDCs on about 85% of India’s total tariff lines, as well as preferential access on about 9% of tariff lines. Only 6% tariff lines were under the Exclusion List. He also informed the Committee that the DFTP Scheme had recently been expanded. In particular, with effect from 1 April 2014, the scheme now provided duty-free market access to LDCs on about 96% of India’s tariff lines at the 6-digit level of the Harmonized System (HS), as well as preferential access on 2.2% of the lines. Only 1.8% of the tariff lines had been retained in the Exclusion List. He noted that table 2 of the Secretariat report laid out India's DFQF coverage at the 8-digit HS level, which corresponded to duty-free product coverage on 94.1% of tariff lines and preferential access on an additional 3.2% of tariff lines. Only 2.7% of tariff lines at the 8-digit level were excluded from the scheme. An important aspect of the scheme was that it was open to all 48 LDCs. In order to benefit from the scheme, each LDC was required to submit a letter of intent to the Government of India. A total of 31 LDCs had thus far become beneficiaries of the scheme. He urged the remaining LDCs to finalize their internal processes in this regard.","WTCOMTDM92.pdf","India, Hong, Kong, Ministerial, Conference, India, LDCs, WTO, India, Committee, India, Secretariat, India, LDC, India, LDCs"

He recalled that the November 2012 submission by China, Cuba, Ecuador, India and the African Group in document WT/COMTD/W/192 contained a proposal for the CTD to report on development work in the WTO. A proposal with broadly similar aims was later circulated in October 2013 by Barbados, Belize, Benin, Botswana, Kenya, Lesotho and Mauritius in document WT/COMTD/W/202. In light of the similarities in the objectives of these two proposals, Members were informed at the 92nd Session that the proponents of WT/COMTD/W/192 and WT/COMTD/W/202 were working to combine their ideas for the CTD to report on development work in the WTO, so as to come up with a new, single proposal on this matter. The new proposal was essentially a joint effort by the two groups of proponents. He also recalled that the Committee had had the opportunity to undertake a preliminary consideration of the new proposal at the informal, open-ended CTD meeting held on 26 January 2015. On that occasion, he had encouraged the proponents to consult with Members in the lead-up to the present meeting. He invited the proponents to introduce the proposal and to brief the Committee on the status of the proposal.","WTCOMTDM93.pdf","Chairman, China, Cuba, Ecuador, India, African, Group, CTD, WTO, Barbados, Belize, Benin, Botswana, Kenya, Lesotho, Mauritius, Members, CTD, WTO, Committee, CTD, Members, Committee"

The objective of the proposal was to enhance intra-reporting among WTO bodies, and thereby operationalize the CTD's mandate as the focal point for development issues in the WTO. He noted that the proponents had tried to accommodate some of the concerns that had been raised in earlier discussions, and recalled that the proposal had been introduced at the informal, open-ended CTD meeting on 26 January 2015.

He recalled the mandate from MC8 and noted that the CTD had been reporting annually to the General Council even before MC8, as had other subsidiary bodies of the General Council. Therefore, in giving their instructions at MC8, Ministers had wanted more from the CTD than its annual report. The CTD was a special body in the WTO. It was the focal point for the consideration and coordination of development-related work, and therefore had an overarching mandate. His delegation believed that it was appropriate for the CTD to report regularly on the development- related work that was taking place in other WTO bodies and provide the necessary recommendations to the General Council on achieving better coordination within the WTO on development issues.","WTCOMTDM93.pdf","India, Egypt, CTD, General, Council, General, Council, CTD, CTD, WTO, CTD, WTO, General, Council, WTO"

"10764",10764,"14","14.    The representative of the European Union shared her delegation's view that the CTD needed to further explore the positive link between trade and development in order to implement its mandate. This needed to be based on constructive discussions on clearly identified topics, in line with the instructions from MC8 to carry out focused work. With regard to the new proposal, she said that her delegation's previous concerns remained. The proposal, which was to instruct the CTD to review development-related activities and issues raised in other WTO bodies and provide the General Council with recommendations, would give the CTD an oversight function for development issues in all aspects of the WTO's work. The EU's view was that the CTD must deliver on its mandate to act as a focal point on development issues and carry out focused work. Members needed to debate what this focused work should be, and not re-open the CTD's mandate.","WTCOMTDM93.pdf","European, Union, CTD, CTD, WTO, General, Council, CTD, WTO, EU, CTD, Members, CTD"

The representative of Egypt expressed his disappointment with the climate of the discussion in the CTD, in particular since there appeared to be a revival of dynamism elsewhere in the WTO. He said that when Ministers at MC8 had requested Members to fully operationalize the mandate of the CTD as a focal point for development work, they had been of the view that at least some areas of the CTD's work needed to be strengthened. The proponents of WT/COMTD/W/208 believed that the CTD's reporting function was one of these areas. Furthermore, the proponents did not share the view that the proposed reporting went beyond the CTD's mandate. He highlighted his concern that some Members were not even willing to discuss the idea, and noted that if progress could not be made on this matter, it would also be difficult to make progress in the CTD on other issues.","WTCOMTDM93.pdf","Egypt, CTD, WTO, Members, CTD, CTD, CTD, CTD, Members, CTD"

The first proposal, which was for the Secretariat to prepare an update to its paper on the implementation of special and differential treatment (S&D) provisions in the WTO Agreements and Decisions, had been agreed to by the Committee at its 87th Session. The updated Secretariat paper was circulated in June 2013 and had appeared on the CTD's agenda for a number of meetings. As for the second proposal, which was for the CTD to report on development work in the WTO, this idea was now being dealt with in the new proposal contained in document WT/COMTD/W/208 which had been discussed under the previous sub-item. The remaining proposal in document WT/COMTD/W/192 was for the CTD to make a recommendation for parties to regional trade agreements (RTAs) to submit their notification and information requirements jointly. On this proposal, he recalled that he had previously encouraged the proponents to continue their consultations with Members. He invited the proponents to brief Members on the status of the proposal.","WTCOMTDM93.pdf","Chairman, Committee, Secretariat, WTO, Committee, Secretariat, CTD, CTD, WTO, CTD, Members, Members"

The proposal had been put forward in an effort to address this matter. He emphasized that the proposal had been drafted in terms of a recommendation, and Members should therefore not see this as a binding obligation.","WTCOMTDM93.pdf","Egypt, Committee, CTD, GATT, Members"

The representative of Ecuador informed the Committee that progress had been made in his delegation's consultations with Members that had requested greater clarity on the scope and purpose of the proposal. In this regard, he indicated that he wished to share a number of points which had emerged from the consultations. He recalled firstly that his delegation had stated on previous occasions that it was prepared to be flexible in terms of the frequency of updates to the Secretariat paper. In particular, after considering the matter, Ecuador believed that updating the paper every two years would be effective in meeting the information needs of Members, without overburdening the Secretariat. Second, his delegation believed that a permanent agenda item relating to this matter might not be necessary. Rather, it could be left to the discretion of Members to place the item on the agenda. Finally, he said that the main potential link between the proposal and the Monitoring Mechanism (MM) on S&D was that the updated paper could serve as an input to inform the discussion held in the context of the MM. A Member wishing to use the paper in this way would need to outline in its request the scope and purpose of the proposed discussion.","WTCOMTDM93.pdf","Ecuador, Committee, Members, Secretariat, Ecuador, Members, Secretariat, Members, S&D, Member"

He believed that bilateral consultations needed to continue, and that there was the real possibility of a way forward on the proposal if the spirit of flexibility continued. Australia had no philosophical objection to the core premise of the proposal, and believed that the flexibilities demonstrated by Ecuador thus far were bringing Members closer to a resolution. Although his delegation could not accept the proposal in its current form, he believed that there was a form of the proposal that could be acceptable.","WTCOMTDM93.pdf","Australia, Ecuador, Members, Australia, Ecuador, Members"
"10778",10778,"27","27.    The representative of the European Union said that her delegation supported the idea of regular updates to the Secretariat paper, although the ideal frequency was something that would need to be discussed. She recalled in this regard that her delegation had previously indicated that it was not convinced of the need for an annual update. However, an update on a biennial basis could be considered, and in this regard she welcomed the indication of flexibility by Ecuador. Regarding the format of the paper, she said that the existing format was appropriate and her delegation would not favour any change in this respect. She suggested that this could be indicated in the proposal. She added that the EU was wondering how the Secretariat paper could serve as a basis for a general discussion, since it was a very technical and dense document. Her delegation wished to have clarification on this point and to hear views from other Members. In concluding, she indicated her delegation's readiness to continue discussing this proposal.","WTCOMTDM93.pdf","European, Union, Secretariat, Ecuador, EU, Secretariat, Members"

The representative of the United States said that his delegation continued to have concerns with the proposal, including with respect to the proposed annual updates to the Secretariat paper. He expressed appreciation for the flexibility Ecuador had demonstrated on this issue. He recalled that his delegation had also questioned the relationship of the proposal with the MM, and in particular whether the proposal would be duplicative. In addition, his delegation had supported the suggestion of postponing the consideration of the proposal until more experience had been gained in the MM. He further recalled that the Secretariat paper circulated in June 2013 had not generated much discussion in the Committee, and in this light his delegation was still wondering how further updates to the paper would produce a different result. Nevertheless, he indicated that his delegation would be willing to meet in a small group with Ecuador and other interested Members to better understand Ecuador's specific objectives and how they would be addressed by the proposal. He expressed his hope that this would allow Members to reach an agreement on how to proceed.","WTCOMTDM93.pdf","United, States, Secretariat, Ecuador, Secretariat, Committee, Ecuador, Members, Ecuador, Members"

The representative of Canada expressed appreciation to Ecuador for the clarifications provided on the proposal and the flexibility that had been signalled with respect to the frequency of updates to the Secretariat paper. Her delegation saw the Secretariat paper as a useful tool and did not object in principle to regular updates, as required. However, she felt that further clarifications were needed on two issues. First, it remained unclear as to how such a technical document could facilitate a general discussion on the implementation of S&D provisions.

The draft factual presentation on the accession of Rwanda and Burundi to the East African Community had also been sent to the parties, and the Secretariat was still waiting to receive comments, which had been requested by 16 June 2014. In addition, the draft factual presentation on the India-MERCOSUR Agreement had been re-sent to the parties on 12 December 2014, and the Secretariat had not yet received comments on the draft, which were requested by 13 February 2015. He recalled that the consideration of this agreement had been postponed at the request of the parties. For a number of other RTAs - namely, RTAs between India and Nepal, India and Afghanistan, India and Bhutan, and Cuba and El Salvador - the full set of data needed to complete the factual presentations had not been submitted by the parties. He urged the parties to these agreements to provide the data as soon as possible. He went on to say that there remained one RTA notified under the Enabling Clause that had not been ratified by all the parties. This was the Pacific Island Countries Trade Agreement (PICTA). Following the procedures of the Committee on Regional Trade Agreements (CRTA), a factual presentation of an RTA falling in this category would only be drafted after the agreement had been ratified by all the parties.

He informed the Committee that he had held some informal consultations with a number of delegations, including on an individual basis, on the issues surrounding the three sub-items. While these consultations had helped him to better understand Members' positions, it was clear that further discussions - particularly among the concerned delegations - would be necessary before a solution could be found. In this light, he encouraged delegations to reach out to each other and discuss the matter with a view to finding a solution.

Some Members had expressed the view that the systemic concerns raised in document WT/COMTD/W/175 were outside the scope of the CTD, and needed to be discussed in the Negotiating Group on Rules                                               WT/COMTD/M/93                                                      -7- (NGR).

He added that the Committee could consult with other WTO bodies in addressing the systemic concerns raised in document WT/COMTD/W/175. This was in keeping with paragraph 3 of the CTD's terms of reference which entrusted the Committee to review periodically, in consultation as appropriate with the relevant bodies of the WTO, the application of special provisions in the Multilateral Trade Agreements and related Ministerial Decisions in favour of developing country Members, and in particular least developed country (LDC) Members, and report to the General Council for appropriate action. In concluding, he indicated that the three sub-items under the present agenda item needed to remain on the CTD's agenda until the systemic and specific concerns arising from ""dually notified"" RTAs were addressed.

The representative of Egypt said that systemic concerns had been raised by some Members, including Egypt, over the legal and procedural implications of the dual notification of the GCC Customs Union under both the Enabling Clause and GATT Article XXIV. He noted that a number of delegations had previously expressed the view that the Enabling Clause did not provide the appropriate legal basis to justify the formation of a customs union involving the reduction or elimination of non-tariff measures (NTMs). However, others had argued that the non-prescription of criteria or conditions for the elimination of NTMs did not exclude customs unions among developing countries from the coverage of the Enabling Clause. The view of his delegation was that the CTD was the appropriate forum to consider the questions arising from RTAs with a dual notification. This originated from the CTD's terms of reference, which stipulated that the CTD was the focal point for the consideration and coordination of work on development in the WTO. In addition, paragraph 4 of the terms of reference mandated the CTD to consider any questions with regard to either the application or the use of special provisions in the Multilateral Trade Agreements and related Ministerial Decisions in favour of developing country Members, which included questions relating to the invocation of the Enabling Clause to notify customs unions among developing countries. He hoped that Members could have a substantive discussion on the systemic concerns that had been raised.

He explained in this regard that, while some Members believed that all three RTA notifications referenced in these sub-items were dual notifications, the view of his delegation was that the GCC Customs Union issue was not an issue of dual notification. He added that his delegation continued to have concerns with the present sub-item being listed on the CTD's agenda. The present sub-item had fulfilled its purpose of informing Members of the notification made, and needed to be removed from the agenda. He regretted that this matter had taken up so much of the Committee's time over the past years and expressed hope that Members could move forward constructively, recognizing that the GCC Customs Union was not an issue of dual notification, but rather something to be addressed in the CRTA under the Transparency Mechanism for RTAs. His delegation looked forward to the transparency review of the GCC Customs Union in the CRTA.

Rather, the paper appeared to be seeking a systemic discussion on RTAs, which was a discussion that was outside the scope of the CTD and belonged in the NGR.

The representative of Uganda, on behalf of the LDC Group, said that DFQF market access was one of the important initiatives taken in favour of LDCs at the Hong Kong Ministerial Conference. This was reaffirmed and further streamlined by Ministers in Bali in December 2013. Recalling elements of the decisions taken at Hong Kong and Bali, he noted that DFQF was perhaps the most effective policy measure taken in support of LDCs to ensure market access for their products and enhance their competitiveness. If DFQF access was complemented by simplified, transparent and predictable rules of origin, LDCs could increase their share in international trade and achieve sustainable development through accelerated exports. Referring to the findings of a recent WTO report, he noted that most developed countries and a number of developing countries had extended DFQF market access to LDCs with various degrees of coverage and range. As a result, the number of dutiable lines for LDCs' products in most developed country markets and some developing country markets were gradually narrowing down. However, DFQF implementation remained mixed. While some countries had taken the lead by extending the coverage, in other cases many important items of LDCs' export interest were still not covered, and some Members maintained preferential schemes that discriminated among LDCs' products. In addition, stringent procedures to meet rules of origin requirements constrained the capacity of LDCs to fully enjoy DFQF, resulting in low utilization and further marginalization.","WTCOMTDM93.pdf","Uganda, LDC, Group, Hong, Kong, Ministerial, Conference, Bali, Hong, Kong, Bali, LDCs, WTO, LDCs, Members"

The LDCs' share in global goods and services trade was only about 1.2%. This called for the full and faithful implementation of DFQF-related decisions by all developed Members, and the provision of accelerated and targeted technical and financial support to LDCs to enhance their export competitiveness. He also observed that, while tariffs had significantly come down in many developed and developing markets, NTMs had been increasing in recent years. Attempting to meet requirements relating to sanitary and phytosanitary measures (SPS) and technical barriers to trade (TBT) was burdensome for LDCs. Furthermore, LDCs dependent on primary agricultural products faced challenges to enhance their exports due to high tariffs and, in some cases, tariff rate quotas. In concluding, he highlighted the importance of enhanced market access for LDCs. He additionally noted that addressing supply side constraints and enhancing productive capacity were equally crucial. In the view of the LDC Group, making DFQF a legally binding obligation needed to be one of the agenda items at the Tenth Ministerial Conference (MC10). The improvement of preferential rules of origin in line with the Bali Decision on this matter, the removal of NTMs, as well as capacity building, the strengthening of the Enhanced Integrated Framework (EIF) and the mobilization of more Aid for Trade also needed focused attention.","WTCOMTDM93.pdf","LDCs, LDCs, Members, LDCs, LDC, Group, DFQF, Bali, EIF"

"10815",10815,"60","60.    The representative of India updated Members on India's Duty Free Tariff Preference (DFTP) scheme for LDCs. He said that, pursuant to the Hong Kong Ministerial Declaration, India had been the first developing country to announce a comprehensive scheme under the DFQF mandate in April 2008. The scheme – which was notified to the WTO in September 2011 – came into full operation in October 2012, providing duty-free access on about 85% of India’s total tariff lines and preferential access on about 9% of tariff lines. Subsequently, the scheme was expanded and - with effect from 1 April 2014 - provided duty-free market access on about 96% of India’s tariff lines at the 6-digit level of the Harmonized System, as well as preferential access on 2.2% of the lines. Only 1.8% of the tariff lines had been retained in the exclusion list with no concessions. He went on to say that India had issued revised rules of origin through notification No. 29/2015 - Customs (Non-Tariff) dated 10 March 2015. These rules further liberalized the determination of origin by stipulating that a change in tariff heading at the 6-digit level would be one of the criteria to confer origin. The verification procedures for the certification of origin had also been strengthened in order to facilitate the entry of beneficiary countries' exports into the Indian market. He mentioned that the scheme was open to all 48 LDCs, and 31 LDCs had so far become beneficiaries. He urged the remaining LDCs to finalize their internal processes and to intimate to India their willingness to benefit from the scheme.","WTCOMTDM93.pdf","India, Members, India, Hong, Kong, India, WTO, India, India, India, Customs, LDCs, LDCs, India"
"10816",10816,"61","61.     He also noted that developed countries had a greater obligation than developing countries to provide DFQF market access to LDCs. Referring to the Secretariat report contained in document WT/COMTD/W/206, he noted that one developed country provided duty-free access on 82.6% of tariff lines, which was about 15 percentage points below the minimum for developed countries mentioned in the Hong Kong DFQF Decision. Furthermore, the Generalized System of Preferences (GSP) scheme of that developed country had expired on 31 July 2013, and many imports from LDCs that would otherwise have received duty-free treatment were subject to most-favoured-nation (MFN) tariffs. In concluding, he said that India welcomed feedback from LDCs that would help iron out any difficulties they faced in taking advantage of the DFTP Scheme.","WTCOMTDM93.pdf","Secretariat, Hong, Kong, GSP, MFN, India"

The representative of the European Union said that she wished to reiterate her delegation's strong attachment to the DFQF commitments made at the Hong Kong Ministerial Conference, as well as its support for the Bali DFQF Decision. The EU welcomed the progress achieved on the Hong Kong commitments by both developed countries and developing countries, and in particular the considerable progress achieved by some emerging economies. However, she noted that further progress was also possible - both in terms of market access for LDC products, as well as in the context of the transparency, reliability and quality of data. The current UN discussions on the Post-2015 Development Agenda and the 3rd International Conference on Financing for Development provided an opportunity to make commitments in this respect. Members also needed to be in a position to show tangible progress at MC10.","WTCOMTDM93.pdf","European, Union, Hong, Kong, Ministerial, Conference, Bali, EU, Hong, Kong, UN, Members"

The group wished to inform Members of ongoing work to prepare a comprehensive external evaluation of the WTO’s TRTA, including as provided through the Doha Development Agenda Global Trust Fund. He noted that external evaluations had become routine for technical assistance. In the WTO context, the previous evaluation - called the Strategic Review of the WTO's TRTA - was conducted in 2006. The overarching purpose of the present evaluation was to look at how resources were being used, so as to ensure that the WTO's TRTA was geared in a way that had the best possible impact on developing countries' ability to make use of the multilateral trading system. The evaluation would be funded through extra-budgetary resources from a number of donors. Planned TRTA activities would therefore be unaffected. At this stage, the donors funding the evaluation were Australia, the EU, Finland, Norway and Sweden.","WTCOMTDM93.pdf","European, Union, WTO, TRTA, Austria, Australia, Canada, EU, Finland, France, Germany, Norway, Sweden, US, Members, WTO, Doha, Development, Agenda, Global, Trust, Fund, WTO, WTO, TRTA, WTO, TRTA, Australia, EU, Finland, Norway, Sweden"

As a first step, the Secretariat had been asked to prepare draft terms of reference. The evaluation would be guided by the terms of reference, and an inception report would specify the detailed evaluation issues and methodology. He also informed the Committee that the evaluation would be carried out by a team of consultants with the required expertise, selected using standard WTO                                         WT/COMTD/M/93                                               - 11 - procurement practices, and would be undertaken in accordance with internationally accepted norms and standards. The consultants would involve all stakeholders in their work. The entire evaluation process, including the preparation and procurement, was expected to take almost a year, with a final evaluation report expected in February 2016. The aspects and scope of the evaluation were to be outlined in the final terms of reference. The scope was expected to be broad, covering all the WTO's TRTA in the 2010-2014 period, irrespective of the funding source. The evaluation would be overseen by a steering committee, the exact composition of which was still to be worked out. He noted that it was important for both donors and beneficiaries to be represented.

The Chairman said that a matter was being raised under ""Other Business"" concerning the CTD's mandate to keep under continuous review the participation of developing country Members in the multilateral trading system. It had been the CTD's practice to hold a discussion on this subject every two years or so. On previous occasions when this item was placed on the CTD's agenda, the Secretariat had updated its statistical background paper on the participation of developing countries in global trade, in order to assist Members in their discussion. The last such discussion by the CTD on this subject had taken place in October 2013. He proposed that the CTD have another discussion on the subject at its last meeting of 2015, for which the Secretariat would once again update its background paper using the most recent statistics.","WTCOMTDM93.pdf","Chairman, CTD, Members, CTD, CTD, Secretariat, Members, CTD, CTD, Secretariat"

About 70% of the activities were delivered in English, 18% in French and 12% in Spanish. With regard to the Progressive Learning Strategy (PLS), the highest number of activities was at the intermediate level. The Secretariat had been able to assign a PLS level to 83% of the activities. She explained that it was not possible to assign a PLS level to all the activities, since some did not fit into the PLS structure. In closing, she indicated that a representative of the ITTC's Strategic Planning, Monitoring and Evaluation Section would provide an overview of the monitoring and evaluation section of the report.","WTCOMTDM95.pdf","Geneva, Africa, TA, Secretariat, ITTC, Evaluation, Section"
"10854",10854,"13","13.    The representative of the Strategic Planning, Monitoring and Evaluation Section said that the approach being used for TA monitoring and evaluation was a mix of self-evaluation of the immediate results, complemented by some on-site evaluations. Longer-term results were assessed through ex-post programme evaluations, as well as country reviews. External evaluations were also undertaken from time to time. In 2014, the focus of evaluations was on immediate results. The ITTC carried out two on-site evaluations - for the Advanced Trade Policy Course (ATPC), and for the RTPCs. With regard to e-learning, he informed the Committee that the average success rate was 61% for 2014. Although this was lower than in 2013, it was nevertheless still good by industry standards. Other indicators of success were stable. Due to the increase in the number of participants taking e-learning courses, a growth in the number of successful participants was registered. Turning to the RTPCs, he said that 97% of the candidates were successful. It was hoped that the recommendations that were made relating to the course objectives, the organization, the programme and the pedagogy would help to maintain and reinforce the quality of the RTPCs. With respect to other face-to-face activities, evaluations were based on the views of participants. On average, the rating was 4.6 out of 5 in terms of their views on objectives achieved. He also briefly noted the positive results of assistance provided in a number of other areas, including accessions, trade facilitation and the compilation of trade statistics.","WTCOMTDM95.pdf","Monitoring, and, Evaluation, Section, ATPC, Committee"

He stressed the importance of ensuring that individuals benefiting from TA were able to use their knowledge during their careers, and to transmit it to others. He also noted the likely need for targeted TA to implement the outcomes of the Tenth Ministerial Conference (MC10).","WTCOMTDM95.pdf","Benin, WTO"
"10856",10856,"15","15.    The representative of the European Union recalled her delegation's attachment to the WTO’s TA, which she indicated was of great importance in helping developing countries to fully integrate into the multilateral trading system. The WTO's continued focus on LDCs and on Africa was also reflected in the EU’s own TA priorities, notably in the context of Aid for Trade. Turning to the                                          WT/COMTD/M/95                                                 -4- report, she said that the EU welcomed the stabilization of resources. She recalled in this regard the EU's continued and stable contribution to the Doha Development Agenda Global Trust Fund (DDAGTF). Noting that TA that supported negotiating and implementation agendas reinforced the WTO, she welcomed the assertion in the report that TA in the area of trade facilitation was supportive of the ratification and implementation of the Trade Facilitation Agreement (TFA).","WTCOMTDM95.pdf","European, Union, WTO, TA, WTO, Africa, EU, EU, EU, Doha, Development, Agenda, Global, Trust, Fund, WTO, TA, TFA"

He firstly noted that it was mentioned in paragraph 3.8 that no activity request was approved in 2014 without a clear definition of the objectives and a draft programme designed to achieve them. In this regard, he asked for more clarity on the activity requests that were not approved as a result of the review process. Turning to e-learning, he indicated that his delegation looked forward to seeing statistics on the four new online courses offered in 2014. He also observed from paragraph 5.5 that the average success rate in e-learning had fallen for the third year in a row. Although he had taken note of the Secretariat’s observation that this was still considered good by industry standards, his delegation remained interested in knowing what steps could be taken to improve student success. In addition, he indicated that the overall dropout rate had increased from 14% in 2013 to 17% in 2014. Certain courses had significant dropout rates each year. In this regard, he asked what could be done to keep students in training. Finally, he expressed appreciation to the Secretariat for its work in recasting the ATPC.","WTCOMTDM95.pdf","United, States, Secretariat, Secretariat, ATPC"

In this regard, her delegation wished to see more explicit linkages in future annual reports to the key results. She observed that, even though the biennium was not over, it was nevertheless possible to provide insights as to whether the targets set in the TA Plan were being achieved.

However, the ITTC was currently in the process of making the courses more interactive and introducing new features which it was hoped would make it easier for the participants to absorb the material. Another possibility that was being explored was to divide existing courses into a number of shorter courses.

He urged the parties to these agreements to provide the data as soon as possible. He went on to say that there remained one RTA notified under the Enabling Clause that had not been ratified by all the parties. This was the Pacific Island Countries Trade Agreement (PICTA).

The representative of Egypt said that systemic concerns had been raised by some Members, including Egypt, over the legal and procedural implications of the dual notification of the GCC Customs Union under both the Enabling Clause and GATT Article XXIV. He noted that a number of delegations had previously expressed the view that the Enabling Clause did not provide the appropriate legal basis to justify the formation of a customs union involving the reduction or elimination of non-tariff measures (NTMs). However, others had argued that the non-prescription of criteria or conditions for the elimination of NTMs did not exclude customs unions among developing countries from the coverage of the Enabling Clause. The view of his delegation was that the CTD was the appropriate forum to consider the questions arising from RTAs with a dual notification. This originated from the CTD's terms of reference, which stipulated that the CTD was the focal point for the consideration and coordination of work on development in the WTO. In addition, paragraph 4 of the terms of reference mandated the CTD to consider any questions with regard to either the application or the use of special provisions in the Multilateral Trade Agreements and related Ministerial Decisions in favour of developing country Members, which included questions relating to the invocation of the Enabling Clause to notify customs unions among developing countries. He hoped that Members could have a substantive discussion on the systemic concerns that had been raised.

He regretted that this issue had taken so much of the Committee’s time over the past few years, and observed that these were the types of issues that took time, resources, and attention away from other pressing developing matters. The US had stated its position on this issue clearly and there was no need to rehash those points at the present meeting.

With reference to the three notifications in question, she indicated that the EU was open to discuss a pragmatic solution, if this would allow Members to solve the matter and put it behind them. She noted, however, that there was a need to make a clear distinction between the notifications of the ASEAN-Korea Agreement and the India-Korea Agreement on the one hand, and the notification of the GCC Customs Union on the other. Furthermore, a more substantive discussion beyond the pragmatic solution would have to take place in the Negotiating Group on Rules (NGR).

He said that the issues surrounding the ASEAN-Korea Agreement and the India-Korea Agreement had been pending in the CTD for several years. Korea wished to reiterate its position with regard to the notifications of these two RTAs. He observed that Korea notified its RTAs under GATT Article XXIV, and that all RTAs - including RTAs between developing countries - could be notified under this provision. However, a notification under GATT Article XXIV did not undermine the authority of the CTD or the Enabling Clause. Despite his delegation's position on this matter, he indicated that Korea was open to any proposal which could contribute to finding a solution.","WTCOMTDM95.pdf","Korea, CTD, Korea, Korea, GATT, GATT, CTD, Korea"

Written communications by some Members had also been considered.","WTCOMTDM95.pdf","Chairman, LDCs, CTD, Members"
"10912",10912,"66","66.    The representative of Bangladesh, on behalf of the LDC Group, said that LDCs had not yet been meaningfully integrated into the multilateral trading system. Additional efforts were therefore needed to provide them with adequate market opportunities, which would ultimately help them to achieve their overarching goals of economic growth and poverty reduction. Full and timely implementation of the DFQF-related Decisions, coupled with simplified, flexible, transparent and predictable rules of origin, would help to integrate LDCs into the multilateral trading system. He noted that the CTD continued to annually review the steps taken by Members to provide DFQF market access to LDCs, as per the Bali Decision on this matter. With regard to the post-Bali work program, he said that this was to, inter alia, build on the decisions taken on LDC issues at Bali. Issues in the Bali Package where legally binding outcomes could not be achieved would be prioritized. He noted that the Bali DFQF Decision represented a best-endeavour outcome, and was intended to make progress on the issue prior to the conclusion of the Doha Round. The successful conclusion of the Round would result in the full implementation of the Hong Kong DFQF Decision, which was for LDCs to have at least 97% DFQF coverage as part of the single undertaking.

Referring to the findings of a recent Secretariat report, he noted that most developed countries and a number of developing countries had extended DFQF market access to LDCs with various degrees of coverage and range. While acknowledging the progress made, he also indicated that gaps remained which needed to be addressed. Furthermore, the LDCs had not seen much effort to improve DFQF coverage, as instructed by Ministers at Bali. He recalled that the General Council was required to report to MC10 on the implementation of the Bali DFQF Decision, including any recommendations. The LDCs believed that making DFQF a legally binding obligation needed to be one of the priorities for MC10. The improvement of preferential rules of origin in line with the Bali Decision on this matter, the removal of NTMs, as well as capacity building, the strengthening of the Enhanced Integrated Framework (EIF) and the mobilization of more Aid for Trade also needed focused attention. The LDCs were of the view that these issues, among others, needed to be inherent components of the post-Bali work program.","WTCOMTDM95.pdf","Secretariat, LDCs, Bali, General, Council, Bali, LDCs, Bali, EIF, LDCs"

In this light, he called on developed country Members that had not yet achieved the 97% mark to improve their coverage for LDCs, as outlined in the Bali DFQF Decision. He also expressed appreciation to the developing countries that had established DFQF schemes for LDCs, and encouraged others to follow these efforts. Finally, he indicated that the full implementation of the Hong Kong and Bali DFQF Decisions would allow the Doha Round to conclude in a meaningful way, ensuring sustainable development in LDCs and lifting millions out of poverty.","WTCOMTDM95.pdf","Cambodia, Bangladesh, Members, Bali, Hong, Kong, Bali"

The representative of Bangladesh said that, in spite of two Ministerial Decisions on DFQF market access for LDCs, there had been little progress in DFQF coverage in certain markets. The LDCs believed that there was a need for a dedicated session of the CTD on the implementation of the Bali DFQF Decision, with a view to realizing the commitment that Members had undertaken to provide DFQF market access to LDCs' products. He said that the proposal for a dedicated session was recently made by Lesotho at a Green Room meeting. All key delegations were present, and no objections were raised. Bangladesh, as the LDC Coordinator, had supported the request. He believed that a dedicated session of the CTD would provide an opportunity to discuss the state of play on DFQF market access, and to consider what could be done to build on the Bali DFQF Decision, taking into account the interests of all stakeholders. The work in the CTD would then be reported to the General Council, with the possibility of recommendations going to MC10.","WTCOMTDM95.pdf","Bangladesh, LDCs, CTD, Bali, Members, Lesotho, Bangladesh, CTD, Bali, CTD, General, Council"

The representative of Nepal associated his delegation with the intervention by Bangladesh, and supported the idea of holding a dedicated session of the CTD on DFQF implementation. He said that DFQF was one of the important initiatives taken in favour of LDCs at the Hong Kong Ministerial Conference. This was reaffirmed and further streamlined by Ministers in Bali in December 2013. Recalling elements of the Hong Kong and Bali DFQF Decisions, he noted that DFQF was perhaps the most effective policy measure taken in support of LDCs to ensure market access for their products and enhance their competitiveness. However, although the number of dutiable lines for LDCs' products in most of the developed and some developing country markets was narrowing down, DFQF implementation remained mixed. Some countries or groups had taken the lead by extending the range of coverage, but others had not yet reached the 97% DFQF threshold for all LDCs. Many important items of export interest to LDCs were still not covered under preferential schemes, and some schemes discriminated among LDCs' products. In addition, stringent rules of origin procedures constrained the capacity of LDCs to fully enjoy the benefits of DFQF market access, leading to low utilization rates and further marginalization.","WTCOMTDM95.pdf","Nepal, Bangladesh, CTD, Hong, Kong, Ministerial, Conference, Bali, Hong, Kong, Bali, LDCs, LDCs"
"10919",10919,"72","72.   He indicated that, in light of the LDCs' relatively small share in global trade, there was a need for the full and faithful implementation of the DFQF-related Decisions by all developed Members, as well as those developing country Members in a position to do so. There was also a need for accelerated and targeted technical and financial support to LDCs to enhance their export competitiveness. In this regard, he expressed particular appreciation to the developing countries that had notified their DFQF schemes. He also observed that LDCs continued to face market access problems due to tariffs and non-tariff barriers. They were additionally challenged by internal and                                          WT/COMTD/M/95                                                - 11 - external constraints, and particular vulnerabilities. Despite some of the achievements and improvements observed, the expansion of market access still remained problematic, due to the non-binding nature of DFQF. In this light, he believed that it was pertinent to hold a dedicated session of the CTD in order to allow Members to explore how the Hong Kong and Bali DFQF Decisions could be fully operationalized and made legally binding. The dedicated session would also provide the opportunity for LDCs and preference granting countries to exchange views on expanding DFQF coverage and overcoming challenges associated with utilization, so as to allow the DFQF-related Decisions to achieve the intended results for LDCs. Finally, he shared his delegation's view that making DFQF a legally binding obligation needed to be one of the agenda items for MC10, and had to therefore be well reflected in the post-Bali work programme.","WTCOMTDM95.pdf","Members, Members, LDCs, CTD, Members, Hong, Kong, Bali, LDCs"

He explained that the DFQF issue had been outstanding for quite some time, and a dedicated session of the CTD could help Members move forward. He observed that there were certain sensitivities associated with the matter, and he hoped that the issues that had been blocking the process over the years could be addressed during the dedicated session, so that there could be a result at MC10. He noted in this regard that it was important to take into account all relevant mandates that had been given by Ministers. He also emphasized the need to achieve the intended results envisaged through the granting of DFQF market access to LDCs, including by ensuring that economies and livelihoods improved, and that LDCs were better integrated into the multilateral trading system.","WTCOMTDM95.pdf","Lesotho, CTD, Members, LDCs"

This initiative was being advanced in recognition of the fact that MSMEs were an important force for economic activity, growth, job creation, community resilience and innovation in many developing countries. To promote the internationalization of MSMEs and integrate them into global value chains, Ministers had agreed to address barriers to trade and investment that disproportionately impacted MSMEs relative to larger businesses. In this regard, he highlighted trade facilitation, trade finance, e-commerce and institutional support as priorities for cooperation.

The representative of India said that, pursuant to the Hong Kong Ministerial Declaration, India had been the first developing country to extend DFQF market access to LDCs in 2008. Under India’s Duty Free Tariff Preference (DFTP) Scheme for LDCs, beneficiary countries currently enjoyed duty-free access on about 96% of India’s tariff lines at the 6-digit level of the Harmonized System, as well as preferential access on 2.2% of the lines. Only 1.8% of the tariff lines had been retained in the exclusion list with no concessions. The scheme was open to all LDCs, and so far 31 had become beneficiaries. He also noted that the International Trade Centre (ITC) had launched a project in 2014 called Supporting India's Trade Preferences for Africa (SITA), which was helping Ethiopia, Kenya, Rwanda, Tanzania and Uganda to utilize India’s DFTP Scheme in order to enhance their exports. He went on to say that developed Members had a greater obligation to provide DFQF market access to the LDCs. In this regard, his delegation noted that one developed Member differentiated between LDCs, and provided duty-free access to non-African LDCs on only 82.6% of tariff lines - which was about 15 percentage points below the minimum for                                          WT/COMTD/M/96                                                -4- developed countries mentioned in the Hong Kong DFQF Decision.

His delegation recognized the need for LDCs to integrate into the multilateral trading system, and was ready to contribute positively towards the elaboration of an LDC package that did not undermine the development concerns of other Members. He emphasized that any initiative or decision that would turn into a development deficit for any Member should not be pursued. With regard to DFQF market access, he said that the position of his delegation had not changed. He believed that it was necessary to have an assessment of full DFQF market access on some of Mauritius' most sensitive exports. Trade data showed that for some sectors, and in particular for garments, Mauritius had an important competitive gap relative to other, more competitive, suppliers. Some developing countries, including Mauritius, continued to face pressure to sustain their economic and social development, and were at least as vulnerable as some of the LDCs that were likely to benefit from DFQF market access. This was the motivation behind the reflection in the Hong Kong DFQF Decision to take into account the impact on developing countries at similar levels of development. In the view of his delegation, there was a need for a study on the possible impact of DFQF implementation on both developing countries and LDCs. Such a study would help Members to take an informed decision.","WTCOMTDM96.pdf","Mauritius, Members, Member, Mauritius, Mauritius, Mauritius, Hong, Kong, Members"

Some developed Members granted close to 100% DFQF market access, covering all products of export interest to LDCs. A number of developing Members like Chile, China, India and the Republic of Korea had also come forward with comprehensive DFQF schemes which were comparable to the coverage provided by the developed Members. He recalled that, in 2014, the Secretariat had prepared a report providing information on the status of DFQF market access provided by developed and developing Members, as per the Bali DFQF Decision. The Secretariat report demonstrated that three developed Members were yet to provide 97% DFQF market access, and certain schemes excluded products of major export                                             WT/COMTD/M/96                                                    -5- interest to LDCs. This was somewhat frustrating, given that the Doha Round sought to help LDCs improve their participation in world trade and thereby create employment and reduce poverty. Despite the calls in the Bali DFQF Decision for developed Members which were yet to reach the 97% threshold to improve their existing DFQF market access coverage, there had not been any substantial movement by the Members in question. In this context, his delegation wished to hear from these Members about their future plans.","WTCOMTDM96.pdf","Bangladesh, Members, Hong, Kong, Members, LDCs, Members, Chile, China, India, Republic, of, Korea, Members, Secretariat, Members, Bali, Secretariat, Members, Doha, Round, LDCs, Bali, Members, Members, Members"
"10949",10949,"18","18.     The representative of the United States expressed his delegation's support for the Bali Decisions. He informed the Committee that the US had made a serious effort to implement the Bali DFQF Decision, including by taking several actions since the CTD's 95th Session. He pointed firstly to the legislation which reauthorized the US' GSP scheme to 31 December 2017, and which made GSP benefits retroactive to 31 July 2013. Through the GSP scheme, more than 120 developing countries benefitted from duty-free treatment on over 5,000 tariff lines. The US had also passed legislation that extended AGOA for ten years, up to 2025. With respect to AGOA, he informed the Committee that, in August 2015, the US and Gabon had co-hosted the 14th AGOA Forum in Libreville. The theme of the 2015 Forum was: ""AGOA at 15: Charting a Course for a Sustainable US-Africa Trade and Investment Partnership"". The Forum had celebrated the recent reauthorization and the important role of women, civil society, and the private sector in promoting trade, expanding inclusive and sustainable economic growth, and generating prosperity. Under AGOA, the US provided more than 97.5% DFQF market access to African LDC beneficiaries. A third initiative was the extension of the Haiti HOPE and HELP preferences by five years, up to 2025. The Haiti programmes promoted export growth and economic development for Haiti by continuing to provide duty-free entry for a variety of products, including certain apparel products. The programmes supported an estimated 30,000 jobs in Haiti that were created by the apparel industry, which was the country's core export industry and primary source of employment growth.","WTCOMTDM96.pdf","United, States, Committee, US, Bali, CTD, US, GSP, GSP, GSP, US, AGOA, AGOA, Committee, US, Gabon, Libreville, AGOA, AGOA, US, Haiti, Haiti, Haiti, Haiti"
"10950",10950,"19","19.     Fourth, and as part of the reauthorization of the GSP scheme, the US Congress had taken the necessary legislative step to provide legal authority to the President to fully implement the US initiative to provide DFQF market access for upland cotton to LDCs. He noted that the US had already fulfilled part of its DFQF commitment on cotton in 2012, by designating seven products for duty-free treatment under GSP for LDCs only. These seven lines covered in-quota shipments of upland cotton from LDCs. Under the new law, the President had the authority to eliminate duties for LDCs on five additional tariff lines covering out-of-quota quantities of these products. The domestic process required for these products to receive duty-free treatment was underway. He expressed hope that the domestic process could be completed before MC10, which would allow the US to fulfill its commitment on DFQF market access for upland cotton to LDCs. Taken together, all of these legislative changes extended benefits to developing countries, including LDCs, and provided greater certainty to manufacturers, workers, and traders. He added that, in recognition of the connection between DFQF market access and transparent and simple preferential rules of origin, the US had participated actively in the July 2015 dedicated session of the Committee on Rules of Origin, in particular through the attendance of experts from his capital. In closing, he said that he was sharing these points at the present meeting in order to demonstrate that the US had actively sought to improve its DFQF coverage in 2015, in keeping with the Bali Decision, and remained committed to the initiatives that had been mentioned. His delegation looked forward to working with Members to ensure a positive outcome at MC10.1","WTCOMTDM96.pdf","GSP, US, Congress, US, US, GSP, LDCs, LDCs, US, US, Committee, on, Rules, of, Origin, US, Bali, Decision, Members"

The representative of Bangladesh said that the value of the present meeting lay in addressing the issues that stood in the way of full implementation of the Hong Kong and Bali DFQF Decisions. In this regard, he noted that the Committee had not yet heard from Iceland. He also sought further details on what issues the Russian Federation would need to address in order to ensure progress towards DFQF implementation. As for DFQF implementation by the US, he believed that this merited greater attention, given that the US was a major trading partner of LDCs. Despite the fact that the US was a prime driver of LDC exports, its share of exports from LDCs had declined from 27% to 10% during the 2000-2014 period. No expansion of DFQF       1         This intervention by the US, which was made under agenda item B, is also reflected under agenda item C at the request of the delegation of the US.

With respect to the concerns that had been raised on a potential negative impact on the LDC beneficiaries of AGOA, he referred to recent studies by the International Centre for Trade and Sustainable Development (ICTSD) and the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD). These studies revealed that a full implementation by the US was likely to expand LDC exports by 2.9%. While the exports of Haiti, Uganda, Burkina Faso, Malawi, Cambodia, Bangladesh and Nepal were likely to increase, it was possible that the exports of Lesotho and Madagascar would decline, although the decline would be by less than 2%. He informed the Committee that discussions within the LDC Group had revealed that the difficulties lay on only a few tariff lines. If an appropriate mechanism for safeguarding these few tariff lines could be devised, the possibility of an adverse impact could be removed. It would then be possible to reach close to 100% DFQF coverage while safeguarding the interests of all LDCs. He invited the US to comments on the points that had been raised.","WTCOMTDM96.pdf","Bangladesh, Hong, Kong, Bali, Committee, Iceland, Russian, Federation, US, US, US, LDCs, US, US, LDCs, LDC, AGOA, International, Centre, for, Trade, and, Sustainable, Development, United, Nations, Conference, on, Trade, and, Development, UNCTAD, US, Haiti, Uganda, Burkina, Faso, Malawi, Cambodia, Bangladesh, Nepal, Lesotho, Madagascar, Committee, LDC, Group, US"
"10954",10954,"22","22.    The representative of the United States indicated that there was no one-size-fits-all approach on the matter. He noted that the extension of full DFQF coverage by the US would have serious consequences. In particular, extending DFQF access to those products from LDCs which did not have such access would have an effect on the competitiveness of the LDCs which currently had DFQF access. This was noted in a recent study by UNCTAD, which had concluded that such an extension would induce asymmetric trade effects among LDCs and sub-Saharan African countries. It would benefit competitive apparel-exporting Asian LDCs that had been exporting apparel products under normal MFN tariffs, but would give rise to adjustment challenges for LDCs and non-LDCs among sub-Saharan AGOA apparel exporters, as their existing AGOA preferences would be eroded. He also informed the Committee that the US Trade Representative had recently received a letter representing the views of the governments of all AGOA beneficiary countries. The letter noted the importance of the current US preference programmes to their economies, and expressed deep concern over the negative impacts of providing DFQF market access to imports from non-African LDCs. Copies of the letter could be shared with interested delegations. He urged the LDC delegations in Geneva to familiarize themselves with the ramifications of the US extending DFQF market access to all LDCs. Finally, with regard to the suggestion made at the present meeting for an approach which would exclude certain tariff lines, he said that it was difficult for his delegation to comment on the concept in the absence of additional information.","WTCOMTDM96.pdf","United, States, US, UNCTAD, LDCs, AGOA, AGOA, Committee, US, Trade, Representative, AGOA, US, LDC, Geneva, US"

The representative of Lesotho said that it was important to look into what hurdles existed to provide DFQF market access up to the level indicated in the Hong Kong and Bali Decisions, so as to be able to arrive at a meaningful outcome that was beneficial to all LDCs - and especially the most vulnerable. He also noted that there were matters that went beyond the content of the studies that had been referred to, and that the LDCs were still discussing these matters among themselves.

However, if the analysis could be undertaken under the assumption that the preferences would be granted to both AGOA beneficiaries and LDCs, he believed that the impact would be less. He also noted that many AGOA beneficiaries were, in fact, not trading under AGOA.

The representative of Bangladesh expressed hope that the present meeting would allow Members to exchange views on a way forward to ensure the full implementation of Ministerial Decisions relating to DFQF market access for LDCs. He recalled that the Enabling Clause allowed special treatment for LDCs in the context of Generalized System of Preferences (GSP) schemes. He also recalled the 1996 WTO plan of action for the LDCs, in which it was indicated that developed country Members, and developing country Members on an autonomous basis, would explore the possibilities of granting preferential duty-free access for the exports of LDCs. At a High-Level meeting held in 1997, several Members had pledged to introduce, or extend the coverage of, DFQF market access for LDCs. This was a period during which the United States (US) granted DFQF market access on 1,783 products exclusively for LDCs. In 1999, the General Council adopted a waiver decision exempting developing Members from their most-favoured-nation (MFN)                                          WT/COMTD/M/96                                                 -2- obligation, to the extent necessary to provide preferential tariff treatment to the products of LDCs. The waiver was initially granted until 2009, and was subsequently extended until 2019. He noted the establishment of the European Union (EU)'s Everything But Arms (EBA) initiative in 2001, and the steps taken around this time by Australia, Canada and New Zealand to improve their GSP schemes for LDCs. Among the developing Members, he pointed to the DFQF schemes established by the Republic of Korea and Chinese Taipei during this period. He added that the Doha Round had set an objective of DFQF market access for LDCs, in recognition of the fact that the integration of LDCs into the multilateral trading system required meaningful market access, support for the diversification of their production and export base, and trade-related technical assistance and capacity building.","WTCOMTDM96.pdf","Bangladesh, Members, LDCs, GSP, WTO, Members, Members, Members, United, States, US, General, Council, Members, MFN, EU, EBA, Australia, Canada, New, Zealand, Members, Republic, of, Korea, Taipei"

It was difficult to see the development dimension in such an outcome.

Turning to the 2005 Hong Kong Decision on DFQF market access for LDCs, he noted that three developed countries had yet to implement the Decision by granting DFQF market access on at least 97% of tariff lines. Of these three countries, the US was a major trading partner of LDCs and a prime driver of LDCs' exports. The US had circulated five communications during 2006 and 2007 indicating the steps being taken to implement the Hong Kong Decision. Furthermore, in 2007, the US International Trade Commission (USITC) had initiated an investigation on the probable economic effects of providing DFQF treatment for imports from LDCs. In response to this investigation, Lesotho, as LDC Coordinator, had made a submission to the USITC on 17 April 2007 on behalf of the LDC Group, justifying the rationale for the US to provide DFQF market access to LDCs. The investigation was again carried out in 2011 and Bangladesh, as LDC Coordinator, had submitted observations for a second time. The results of the investigations had not been made publically available. As for the other developed Members that had yet to implement the Hong Kong Decision, he said that it was not known whether Iceland had taken any steps to expand its DFQF coverage past the 90% level observed in 2002. It was also not known whether the Russian Federation had taken any initiatives to expand its DFQF coverage since its accession to the WTO. He went on to recall elements of the 2013 Bali DFQF Decision, and called on the developed Members that were yet to fully implement the DFQF-related Decisions to share with Members the steps they were taking in this regard. Among the developing Members, he noted that Chile and Thailand had notified their DFQF schemes after the Bali Ministerial Conference.

In this light, there were other studies that had suggested that consideration also be given to products with regard to which investment was envisaged in the future.

He cited textiles and clothing as a key example, and stressed the importance of ensuring that DFQF implementation was not harmful to some countries.

With this background, he went on to outline some elements that could be included in the Secretariat study that his delegation was proposing. He said that the study could firstly look into the relevant aspects that needed to be covered in order to implement the Hong Kong and Bali DFQF Decisions, so that all stakeholders were comfortable. It was Bangladesh's understanding that it was possible to reach the 97% threshold without harming any LDCs in the relevant markets. Another element of the study could be to explore the options for moving forward with DFQF coverage, taking into consideration the export interests of all stakeholders. The importance of looking into long-term trends was also highlighted. He clarified that his delegation was asking for statistical facts, on the basis of which Members could take an informed decision on the way forward in the CTD, or in the negotiations. He also noted the importance of the DFQF issue in the context of a meaningful package for LDCs at MC10. In terms of a timeline for the study, he suggested that it would be useful if it could be ready by the middle of November, as Members could then make use of it in their preparations for MC10. In closing, he expressed his hope that Members would be able to arrive at a meaningful decision on DFQF at MC10, which would advance market access opportunities for all LDCs.","WTCOMTDM96.pdf","Bangladesh, CTD, Hong, Kong, Members, Committee, General, Council, Secretariat, Hong, Kong, Bali, Bangladesh, Members, CTD, LDCs, Members, Members"

She informed the Committee that Japan was supporting the participation of LDCs in global value chains through technical and financial assistance, as well as through the provision of DFQF market access above the 97% threshold. She also pointed to the usefulness of discussing specific cases on a bilateral basis. The simplification of the rules of origin in Japan's GSP scheme, which entered into force in April 2015, had been initiated on the basis of a request from an LDC. Finally, she encouraged more developing countries to implement DFQF schemes, in light of the significant role this would play in improving market access for LDCs and contributing to their integration into the global economy.","WTCOMTDM96.pdf","Japan, Committee, Japan, Japan, GSP, LDCs"

He informed the Committee that the US had made a serious effort to implement the Bali DFQF Decision, including by taking several actions since the CTD's 95th Session. He pointed firstly to the legislation which reauthorized the US' GSP scheme to 31 December 2017, and which made GSP benefits retroactive to 31 July 2013. Through the GSP scheme, more than 120 developing countries benefitted from duty-free treatment on over 5,000 tariff lines. The US had also passed legislation that extended the African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA) for ten years, up to 2025. With respect to AGOA, he informed the Committee that, in August 2015, the US and Gabon had co-hosted the 14th AGOA Forum in Libreville. The theme of the 2015 Forum was: ""AGOA at 15: Charting a Course for a Sustainable US-Africa Trade and Investment Partnership"".

The representative of the United States said that he had a general sense of the objectives of a clinical and analytical approach to examining the impediments and potential impact of full implementation of DFQF market access. The question of impact was particularly important for the US, given the concerns that were being expressed to the US Government by preference beneficiaries in Africa, and given that MC10 would be held in Africa. He indicated that his delegation was open to moving forward with some form of work on the basis of what had been suggested, but wished to first see an outline of the proposed Secretariat study. Informal consultations could then be held. He said that he understood the need to move quickly, given that Members were looking at the issue in the context of preparations for MC10. Finally, he observed that, while there were differences in perspective on the DFQF question, Members should not have an expectation that they could rely on the Secretariat to resolve the issues. Ultimately, the issues would need to be resolved by Members themselves.","WTCOMTDM96.pdf","United, States, US, US, Africa, Africa, Secretariat, Members, Members, Secretariat, Members"

Fourth, and as part of the reauthorization of the GSP scheme, the US Congress had taken the necessary legislative step to provide legal authority to the President to fully implement the US initiative to provide DFQF market access for upland cotton to LDCs. He noted that the US had already fulfilled part of its DFQF commitment on cotton in 2012, by designating seven products for duty-free treatment under GSP for LDCs only. These seven lines covered in-quota shipments of upland cotton from LDCs. Under the new law, the President had the authority to eliminate duties for LDCs on five additional tariff lines covering out-of-quota quantities of these products. The domestic process required for these products to receive duty-free treatment was underway. He expressed hope that the domestic process could be completed before the Tenth Ministerial Conference (MC10), which would allow the US to fulfill its commitment on DFQF market access for                                          WT/COMTD/M/96                                                -3- LDCs on upland cotton. Taken together, all of these legislative changes extended benefits to developing countries, including LDCs, and provided greater certainty to manufacturers, workers, and traders. He added that, in recognition of the connection between DFQF market access and transparent and simple preferential rules of origin, the US had participated actively in the July 2015 dedicated session of the Committee on Rules of Origin, in particular through the attendance of experts from his capital. In closing, he said that he was sharing these points at the present meeting in order to demonstrate that the US had actively sought to improve its DFQF coverage in 2015, in keeping with the Bali Decision, and remained committed to the initiatives that had been mentioned.

The representative of Uganda associated his delegation with the statement by Bangladesh, and noted that the LDCs had been seeking enhanced market access opportunities for their products since the establishment of the WTO. He elaborated on the risks of preference erosion, and in this regard emphasized the need for LDCs to obtain DFQF market access as soon as possible. He expressed regret that the language in the Bali DFQF Decision was less binding than the Hong Kong DFQF Decision with respect to attaining the 97% threshold, but noted that paragraph 1.11 of the Bali Ministerial Declaration required Members to pursue on a priority basis those issues in the Bali Package which were not legally binding. The importance of harvesting DFQF as a legally binding outcome at MC10 was highlighted. He went on to express appreciation to those Members that had made notifications relating to their DFQF schemes. In this respect, he said that it was essential for developed countries to ensure that products of commercial interest to LDCs were effectively included. He also encouraged developing countries in a position to do so to implement DFQF schemes and further enhance their market access conditions for LDCs. Finally, he emphasized the importance of simplified and transparent rules of origin in DFQF schemes. He explained that recent reforms of existing rules of origin in some countries had a trade facilitating impact and promoted foreign direct investment in LDCs. In this light, he encouraged Members to conduct meaningful reforms of their rules of origin with the view to making them simple, objective and transparent in order to facilitate LDC exports.","WTCOMTDM96.pdf","Uganda, Bangladesh, LDCs, WTO, LDCs, Bali, Hong, Kong, Bali, Members, Bali, Members, LDCs, Members"

He also explained that the Russian Federation's membership in the Eurasian Economic Union implied that all trade-related policy measures needed to be harmonized between the parties. While this inevitably slowed down the process, it did not compromise the Russian Federation's longstanding commitment to facilitate market access for products originating from LDCs. In this context, he indicated that his delegation would welcome concrete proposals regarding a possible decision on DFQF at MC10.

As such, the Plan was based on the level of activity of the last three years, and had a mix of both traditional and new products. Details on the specific activities were presented in Annex 2 of the document. The achievement of the key results would be monitored on the basis of a number of performance indicators and targets, which had been refined based on lessons learned in previous years. The focus would continue to be on managing for results, and efforts would be made to refine the results-based management monitoring and evaluation tools. The technical assistance activities would concentrate on assisting Members to implement WTO Agreements, and there would be a systematic follow-up to Trade Policy Reviews. Furthermore, the Progressive Learning Strategy would continue to be applied. There would also be more emphasis on interactive training methods, and e-learning would play a critical role. The Secretariat would analyze existing partnerships with other institutions to ensure that these remained meaningful. With regard to the budgeted level of financial resources, she said that a total of CHF 19 million per year would be required to implement the Plan.

With regard to these proposals, he informed the Committee that he had held a small group informal consultation on 16 October 2015, and that the proposals had also been discussed at the informal, open-ended CTD meeting held on 5 November. He indicated that he was willing to work further with Members, as necessary, in order to facilitate progress. He also encouraged Members to consider ways in which the CTD could advance in its work relating to the MC8 mandate.        -    Committee on Trade and Development mandate: focal point for consideration and             coordination of work on development in the WTO - proposal from Barbados, Belize,             China, Cuba, Ecuador, India and the African Group (WT/COMTD/W/208)","WTCOMTDM97.pdf","Chairman, CTD, Members, CTD, Committee, CTD, Committee, CTD, Members, Members, CTD, Committee, on, Trade, and, Development, WTO, Barbados, Belize, China, Cuba, Ecuador, India, African, Group"

He recalled that there were originally two proposals which broadly had this aim, and the proponents of the two proposals had decided to work together. Document WT/COMTD/W/208 was the outcome of their collaboration. He also recalled that, at the informal, open-ended CTD meeting held on 5 November, the proponents had indicated that more consultations would be required before they would be in a position to report on concrete progress with regard to the proposal.","WTCOMTDM97.pdf","Chairman, CTD, WTO, CTD"

The first proposal, which was for the Secretariat to prepare an update to its paper on the implementation of special and differential treatment (S&D) provisions in the WTO Agreements and Decisions, had been agreed to by the Committee at its 87th Session. The updated Secretariat paper was circulated in June 2013 and had appeared on the CTD's agenda for a number of meetings. As for the second proposal, which was for the CTD to report on development work in the WTO, this idea was now being dealt with in the proposal contained in document WT/COMTD/W/208 which had been addressed under the previous sub-item. The remaining proposal in document WT/COMTD/W/192 was for the CTD to make a recommendation for parties to regional trade agreements (RTAs) to submit their notification and information requirements jointly.

He recalled that, at the informal, open-ended CTD meeting held on 5 November, the delegation of Ecuador had reported on some progress with respect to this proposal, and had indicated that a revised proposal would be circulated. In this regard, he informed the Committee that the revised proposal from Ecuador had been circulated on 12 November 2015 in document WT/COMTD/W/204/Rev.1.

The revised version of the proposal had been prepared on the basis of the comments that had been made at these meetings. In the revision, it was proposed that the Secretariat paper be updated at least once every two years. The report would serve as a reference document for Members, and would be used as each Member considered appropriate. It was not intended for the Secretariat paper to be a standing item on the CTD's agenda. If a Member wished to make a request for any particular element in the Secretariat paper to be used as the basis for an item on the CTD's agenda, that Member would explain, in its request, the scope and purpose of the proposed discussion. Following the circulation of the second report by the Secretariat, the Committee would review the report and the discussions that had taken place, in order to determine whether it was worthwhile to continue producing the document. He noted that, while all the objectives of the original proposal had been maintained, additional flexibility had been provided for Members to decide on the use they wished to make of the Secretariat paper. In the view of his delegation, the paper had value, as it provided a clear overview of how S&D provisions were being implemented.","WTCOMTDM97.pdf","Ecuador, Secretariat, Members, Member, Secretariat, CTD, Member, Secretariat, CTD, Member, Secretariat, Committee, Members, Secretariat"

With regard to the revised proposal, she referred to the sentence which read: ""The report must include an objective and analytical listing of the S&D provisions, identifying the measures that have been taken and put forward to operationalize them"". In this sentence, she believed that the phrase ""and put forward"" was not necessary, and could also be confusing, since it was usually proposals that were put forward. She indicated that the EU could agree to the revised proposal, on the understanding that the Secretariat paper would only list measures that had been taken, and would not include reference to any proposals made on how measures could be implemented.","WTCOMTDM97.pdf","European, Union, EU, Secretariat"

If a Member wanted the paper on the agenda of a CTD meeting, it would be that Member's responsibility to explain what was the intended scope of the discussion and how the report would be used.

For a number of other RTAs - namely, RTAs between India and Nepal, India and Afghanistan, India and Bhutan, and Cuba and El Salvador - the full set of data needed to complete the factual presentations had not been submitted by the parties. He urged the parties to these agreements to provide the data as soon as possible. He went on to say that there remained one RTA notified under the Enabling Clause that had not been ratified by all the parties. This was the Pacific Island Countries Trade Agreement (PICTA). Following the procedures of the Committee on Regional Trade Agreements (CRTA), a factual presentation of an RTA falling in this category would only be drafted after the agreement had been ratified by all the parties. The parties to PICTA were urged to inform the Secretariat as soon as all ratifications were complete.","WTCOMTDM97.pdf","the, Association, of, Southeast, Asian, Nations, ASEAN, India, India, Secretariat, ASEAN, Rwanda, Burundi, East, African, Community, Secretariat, India, Nepal, India, Afghanistan, India, Bhutan, Cuba, El, Salvador, RTA, Pacific, Island, Committee, CRTA, RTA, Secretariat"

Turning to the listed sub-items under the present agenda item, the Chairman said that he wished to say a few words in the context of the discussion in the CTD relating to the RTAs notified under both the Enabling Clause and GATT Article XXIV. In particular, he informed the Committee that he had recently held brief informal consultations with some Members, including some of the parties to the RTAs in question. These consultations had helped him to gain a better understanding of the issues, but it was also clear that further discussions would be required before a solution could be found. He indicated his willingness to facilitate any discussions among Members in this regard.        -    Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) notification of Customs Union – communication from             China, Egypt and India (WT/COMTD/W/175)","WTCOMTDM97.pdf","Chairman, GATT, Committee, Members, Members, Gulf, Cooperation, Council, GCC, Customs, Union, China, Egypt, India"

The representative of Egypt said that systemic concerns had been raised by some Members, including Egypt, over the legal and procedural implications of the dual notification of the GCC Customs Union under both the Enabling Clause and GATT Article XXIV. She noted that a number of delegations had previously expressed the view that the Enabling Clause did not provide the                                               WT/COMTD/M/97                                                       -9- appropriate legal basis to justify the formation of a customs union involving the reduction or elimination of NTMs. However, others had argued that the non-prescription of criteria or conditions for the elimination of NTMs did not exclude customs unions among developing countries from the coverage of the Enabling Clause. The view of her delegation was that the CTD was the appropriate forum to consider the questions arising from RTAs with a dual notification. This originated from the CTD's terms of reference, which stipulated that the CTD was the focal point for the consideration and coordination of work on development in the WTO. In addition, paragraph 4 of the terms of reference mandated the CTD to consider any questions with regard to either the application or the use of special provisions in the Multilateral Trade Agreements and related Ministerial Decisions in favour of developing country Members, which included questions relating to the invocation of the Enabling Clause to notify customs unions among developing countries. She hoped that Members could have a substantive discussion on the systemic concerns that had been raised.

Bangladesh – the main proponent – had subsequently submitted an informal document suggesting possible parameters for the proposed Secretariat study. On the basis of this informal document, he had held informal consultations with a number of delegations that had expressed an interest in this issue. He went on to say that his consultations on the elements of a possible study by the Secretariat had not brought any convergence thus far. The delegation of Bangladesh had informed him that the comments and views received from interested Members could not be easily reconciled, and it was therefore not possible to submit a revised proposal at this time. Nevertheless, he indicated that he remained available if Members wished to continue the discussion on the parameters of the study.

The Chairman said that the Bali Ministerial Decision contained in document WT/MIN(13)/44 - WT/L/919 instructed the CTD to continue to annually review the steps taken to provide DFQF market access to the LDCs, and report to the General Council for appropriate action. To aid in its review, the Secretariat was to prepare a report, in close coordination with Members, on their DFQF market access for LDCs at the tariff line level, based on their notifications. He said that the Secretariat report, which had been circulated in document WT/COMTD/W/214, was the second of its kind prepared to facilitate the CTD's annual review of steps taken to provide DFQF market access to LDCs. It built upon, and updated, the previous report issued in November 2014, which was circulated in document WT/COMTD/W/206. It was largely based on last year's report, and followed the same structure. He recalled that a draft of the document had been considered at the informal, open-ended CTD meeting held on 5 November 2015. His general feeling from the discussion at that meeting was that the Secretariat report was useful and informative.","WTCOMTDM97.pdf","Chairman, Bali, Ministerial, Decision, CTD, General, Council, Secretariat, Members, LDCs, Secretariat, CTD, CTD, Secretariat"

His delegation believed that an improvement in market access opportunities for LDCs would help to facilitate their integration into the multilateral trading system, and would contribute to their economic growth and development. In this light, he called on more Members to grant DFQF market access to products from LDCs.","WTCOMTDM97.pdf","Chinese, Taipei, Taipei, Members, WTO, LDCs, Members"

He recalled that it had been agreed at the 93rd Session that the CTD's discussion under this agenda item would take place at the present meeting, based on a background paper prepared by the Secretariat. He invited the Chief of the International Trade Statistics Section to introduce the paper, which had been circulated in document WT/COMTD/W/212.

"11076",11076,"75","75.   The Chief of the International Trade Statistics Section provided a broad summary of the information contained in the Secretariat paper. As part of his presentation, he said that developing economies' participation in international trade had remained high during the 2012-2014 period, which was the focus period of the paper. The share of merchandise exports of developing economies was 43.6% in 2014 - which was almost the same as in 2012 - while the import share increased to 41%. With regard to commercial services, developing economies' export share declined slightly over the period – to about 30% in 2014 – and the import share increased to 38%. Turning to quarterly merchandise trade statistics, he noted that trade had grown unevenly across developing regions. For example, a number of factors - including geopolitical tensions and a drop in fuel prices - had contributed to a decline in the exports of Africa and the Middle East. In developing Asia, the trade of the ""six East Asian traders"" - Hong Kong, China; the Republic of Korea; Malaysia; Singapore; Chinese Taipei; and Thailand - remained stable, while the exports of the rest of the region increased. Latin American trade growth was largely affected by economic slowdown in four of the major economies in the region. He added that, in spite of the difficulties experienced in some developing regions, South-South trade had continued to increase, and was an important contributor to the overall trade of developing economies. China continued to be an important player in South-South trade.","WTCOMTDM97.pdf","International, Trade, Statistics, Section, Secretariat, Africa, Middle, East, Asia, Hong, Kong, China, Republic, of, Korea, Malaysia, Singapore, Taipei, Thailand, South-South, China, South-South"
"11077",11077,"76","76.    He went on to highlight some elements of developing economies' trade in commercial services over the 2012-2014 period. He noted that developing economies' transport exports had not increased, reflecting a context of relatively weak flows of merchandise trade and falling oil prices. Although developing economies remained net exporters of travel, their travel surplus declined sharply in 2014. Developing economies' participation in world exports of ""other commercial services"" remained stable over the focus period, but the participation varied considerably by type of service. In 2014, the largest shares were recorded in construction, other business services, and telecommunications, computer and information services. He next provided some insights into the participation of developing economies in global value chains (GVCs), using Latin American economies as illustrative examples. He noted in this regard that Chile was a developing economy whose participation in GVCs was mainly driven by downstream links and the export of natural resources. A similar predominance of forward GVC linkages could be observed in Colombia. In contrast, Costa Rica and Mexico relied mostly on the import of inputs that they further processed, assembled and embedded into intermediate or final products to be exported. He informed the Committee that the overall participation of developing economies in GVCs increased from about 37% in 1995 to close to 49% in 2011. Finally, with regard to the time taken for developing economies to export and import, he noted that, in 2014, Africa had recorded a reduction of 0.8 days for exporting and 1.1 days for importing. In LDCs, the delays to export and import were reduced by almost a day.","WTCOMTDM97.pdf","Chile, GVC, Colombia, Costa, Rica, Mexico, Committee, Africa"
"11078",11078,"77","77.   The representative of the European Union expressed appreciation for the Secretariat report. She noted that, in a context of lower economic and trade growth, South-South trade had continued to expand in recent years. The increasing share of developing economies, and particularly emerging economies, in global trade also pointed to a growing responsibility towards poorer developing countries. This concerned to some extent the DFQF schemes of developing countries in favour of LDCs. In addition, it reflected the need for a growing responsibility in the area of Aid for Trade and the manner in which development effectiveness principles were taken into account. Finally, she said that her delegation was encouraged by the positive findings regarding the participation of developing economies in GVCs.","WTCOMTDM97.pdf","European, Union, Secretariat, South-South"

It was noted that the draft contained a number of square brackets relating to items under consideration at the 97th Regular Session, as well as at the 4th Dedicated Session on the Monitoring Mechanism on Special and Differential Treatment and the 30th Dedicated Session on Small Economies. The square brackets would be removed as part of the process of adopting the annual report. Noting that Members had been requested to submit in writing any comments on the draft annual report by 10 November, he informed the Committee that no comments had been received on the report.

"11081",11081,"8","8.     The Chairperson of the JAG said that the Group had held its 49th Session on 26 June 2015. At the meeting, delegations had expressed appreciation for the ITC’s renewed focus on innovation, effectiveness, and pragmatic results on the ground. They also confirmed their support for the ITC’s new strategic direction, as laid out in the Strategic Plan for the 2015-2017 period, and particularly welcomed the introduction of the new programmatic approach clustered around six focus areas. The ITC’s achievements in building strategic partnerships - including with the private sector - were recognized. The focus on doing more, and doing it better, was welcomed. Evidence of this was found in the ITC’s expanding portfolio of national and regional programmes, which addressed such areas as trade facilitation, the competitiveness of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), regional economic integration, non-tariff measures (NTMs) and South-South cooperation. The ITC’s work on women’s economic empowerment, promoting young entrepreneurs, and linking SMEs to markets through the use of e-commerce were also seen as important areas in which to maintain a presence. She said that, through such interventions, the ITC would continue to provide demand-driven technical assistance to all of its clients but, in particular, to least developed countries (LDCs), landlocked developed countries (LLDCs), sub-Saharan Africa, small, vulnerable countries, as well as post-conflict and fragile states. In terms of areas for further improvement, delegations at the JAG had, inter alia, mentioned the need to better align the relationship between projects and the activities carried out, and the need to better elaborate the link between funds received and results achieved. The need for more predictable resources was also recognized.","WTCOMTDM97.pdf","Chairperson, JAG, Group, ITC, ITC, ITC, ITC, ITC, ITC, Africa"

She went on to say that the second part of the JAG had focused on the implementation of the recommendations provided by the two recent external evaluations of the ITC, which were the 2014 Independent Evaluation and the 2015 UN Office of Internal Oversight Services (OIOS) Programme Evaluation. The Executive Director of the ITC had reaffirmed to the JAG that all of the strategic recommendations had been accepted. With regard to the first recommendation of the Independent Evaluation - which stressed the need for the ITC to focus on well-defined priorities in order to maximize impact - the Executive Director had pointed to the six thematic focus areas, and to the newly formed Programme Development Task Force. On the second recommendation - which was to further improve the quality of the ITC’s technical work - the Executive Director had indicated that the new project portal would allow a tracking of the progress and results of each project. Furthermore, the ITC’s new Evaluation Policy would allow strengthened reporting on development results. In relation to the third recommendation - on better governance and enhanced accountability - the Executive Director had, inter alia, mentioned the progress made in terms of risk management, costing, and the implementation of UN-wide operating systems. Regarding the final recommendation - on raising the organization's visibility - the Executive Director had pointed to the ITC’s active role in highlighting the importance of SMEs and women’s economic empowerment in the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. The opening of a liaison office in Addis Ababa and the enhancement of the ITC’s presence at the UN's headquarters in New York were also cited as examples. With regard to the additional recommendations made in the OIOS evaluation, the JAG was informed, inter alia, of the new resource mobilization strategy and the gender mainstreaming policy.","WTCOMTDM97.pdf","ITC, UN, Office, of, Internal, Oversight, Services, Director, ITC, ITC, Director, Programme, Development, Task, Force, ITC, Director, ITC, Director, Director, ITC, Addis, Ababa, ITC, UN, New, York"

The Chairman recalled that, at the Eighth Ministerial Conference (MC8), Ministers had, inter alia, reaffirmed the positive link between trade and development and called for focused work in the CTD. Ministers had called on Members to fully operationalize the mandate of the CTD as a focal point for development work. He recalled that, at the 97th Session, the Committee had agreed to the proposal from Ecuador contained in document WT/COMTD/W/204/Rev.1, which had been submitted in the context of the CTD's mandate from MC8. The proposal was for the Secretariat to periodically update its paper on the implementation of special and differential treatment (S&D) provisions in the WTO Agreements and Decisions. He informed the Committee in this regard that he had asked the Secretariat to work on an update to the document, which would be ready later in the year. Turning to the two proposals for work under the MC8 mandate that were to be considered at the present meeting, he observed that the submissions containing these proposals had been appearing on the CTD’s agenda for quite some time, and that it was therefore important for progress to be made. He recalled that he had encouraged the proponents of these proposals to initiate informal discussions with other delegations, as he believed that this was important to move the process forward. Although there had been no progress to report on this matter at a small-group informal consultation held on 3 March 2016, he expressed his hope that some progress could be reported at the present meeting.

With regard to the remaining proposals contained in documents WT/COMTD/W/208 and WT/COMTD/W/192, she observed that Members were no closer to achieving consensus than when the proposals were first addressed in the CTD.

She noted that the European Union (EU) had made efforts to explain its substantive concerns on the two proposals in formal meetings and in informal consultations, but there had been no engagement by the proponents. She also recalled that, in the context of the CTD's discussion on the MC8 mandate, there had been instances of proposals being withdrawn when it was evident that progress was not being made. She hoped to see some movement on this matter in the near future.","WTCOMTDM98.pdf","European, Union, European, Union, EU, CTD"

The Decision - which was contained in document WT/MIN(15)/42 - WT/L/977 – called, inter alia, for a continuation of the work under the Work Programme on E-Commerce, based on the existing mandate and guidelines, and on the basis of proposals submitted by Members in the relevant WTO bodies. He recalled that the CTD was one of the four subsidiary bodies of the General Council that was mandated to implement the WTO's Work Programme on E-Commerce. The most recent contribution of the CTD to the Work Programme was the Workshop on ""E-Commerce, Development and Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises"", which was held on 8 and 9 April 2013. He referred Members to the report on the workshop – contained in document WT/COMTD/W/198 – and on this basis, proceeded to highlight elements of the discussion that had taken place at the workshop. He then encouraged Members wishing to suggest ways to take forward the e-commerce work in the CTD to consider submitting written proposals. He also informed the Committee that, as indicated in the Decision taken at MC10, the General Council's next review of the Work Programme on E-Commerce would be held in July 2016.","WTCOMTDM98.pdf","Chairman, WTO, Work, Programme, Members, WTO, CTD, General, Council, WTO, CTD, Work, Programme, Members, Members, CTD, Committee, General, Council, Work, Programme"

The representative of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) indicated that he wished to take the opportunity to update Members on UNCTAD's work on e- commerce. He emphasized the importance of e-commerce as a driver of economic growth, inclusive trade and job creation in developing countries, but noted that a more concerted approach was needed in order to assist countries to build e-commerce economies. Against this background, UNCTAD had taken the initiative to explore the feasibility of launching an Aid for eTrade initiative. This was envisioned as a demand-driven mechanism for development partners and international organizations - in partnership with the private sector - to make actions more coherent, pool capabilities and resources, and avoid duplication. He proceeded to outline elements of the initiative, and noted that it would seek synergies with existing initiatives and mechanisms, including Aid for Trade and the EIF. Constructive preliminary discussions had been held with selected donors, beneficiary countries, international organizations and business representatives, and a draft Call for Action – which would be open for comments from all stakeholders – was soon to be circulated. An open consultations meeting would also be held during UNCTAD's E-Commerce Week, scheduled for 18-22 April 2016. He went on to highlight elements of the programme for E-Commerce Week, and explained that the event provided an opportunity for discussions on recent developments and policy issues related to e-commerce.","WTCOMTDM98.pdf","United, Nations, Conference, on, Trade, and, Development, UNCTAD, Members, UNCTAD, UNCTAD, EIF, UNCTAD"
"11117",11117,"27","27.   The representative of China acknowledged the importance of the Aid for eTrade initiative. He also emphasized the importance of e-commerce to the Chinese economy, and in this regard noted that most of the Chinese companies involved in cross-border e-commerce were small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), which provided employment for about 2.5 million people. He                                           WT/COMTD/M/98                                                 -6- informed the Committee that efforts to help farmers make better use of e-commerce were an important element of China's poverty alleviation activities, but additionally noted that China - like most developing countries – faced difficulties with weak e-commerce infrastructures and incomplete regulatory frameworks. He believed that a global solution was required to deal with the problems and challenges associated with e-commerce. Noting that useful discussions on e-commerce had taken place at the WTO, he expressed China's willingness to continue to work with Members. He shared his delegation's view that discussions in the CTD needed to focus on the needs of developing Members and the specific difficulties faced by SMEs.","WTCOMTDM98.pdf","China, Committee, China, China, WTO, China, Members, CTD, Members"

In particular, the Arab Mediterranean Free Trade Agreement (Agadir Agreement) between Egypt, Jordan, Morocco and Tunisia was notified on 22 February 2016 in document WT/COMTD/N/48. The parties had been requested to provide the necessary data to the Secretariat for the preparation of the factual presentation by 15 July 2016. Turning to the Agreement between Singapore and the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC), which was notified in 2015, he said that data had been submitted by Singapore. However, the Secretariat was still waiting to receive data from the GCC parties, which had been requested by 23 November 2015. In the case of the Mauritius-Pakistan Agreement - also notified in 2015 - data had been received from the parties, but the Secretariat was seeking some additional clarification before processing the data.","WTCOMTDM98.pdf","Committee, RTA, CTD, Egypt, Jordan, Morocco, Tunisia, Secretariat, Singapore, Gulf, Cooperation, Council, GCC, Singapore, Secretariat, GCC, Secretariat"

With regard to the Agreement between the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) and India, he said that comments had been received from India on the draft factual presentation that was sent to the parties, but the Secretariat was still waiting for comments from ASEAN, which had been requested by 10 January 2014. The Secretariat was also still waiting to receive comments from the parties on the draft factual presentation relating to the accession of Rwanda and Burundi to the East African Community, which had been requested by 16 June 2014. For a number of other RTAs – namely, RTAs between India and Nepal, India and Afghanistan, India and Bhutan, and Cuba and El Salvador - the full set of data needed to complete the factual presentations had not been submitted by the parties. He urged the parties to these agreements to provide the data as soon as possible. He went on to say that there remained one RTA notified under the Enabling Clause that had not been ratified by all the parties. This was the Pacific Island Countries Trade Agreement (PICTA). Following the procedures of the CRTA, a factual presentation of an RTA falling in this category would only be drafted after the Agreement had been ratified by all the parties. The parties to PICTA were urged to inform the Secretariat as soon as all ratifications were complete.","WTCOMTDM98.pdf","the, Association, of, Southeast, Asian, Nations, ASEAN, India, India, Secretariat, ASEAN, Secretariat, Rwanda, Burundi, India, Nepal, India, Afghanistan, India, Bhutan, Cuba, El, Salvador, RTA, Pacific, Island, CRTA, RTA, Secretariat"

The representative of India indicated that his intervention related to the first three sub-items under the present agenda item, since the three RTAs referenced in these sub-items had been ""dually notified"" under both the Enabling Clause and GATT Article XXIV. He noted that the systemic concerns that were raised by China, Egypt and India over the legal and procedural implications of the dual notification of the GCC Customs Union under both the Enabling Clause and                                              WT/COMTD/M/98                                                     -7- GATT Article XXIV were pertinent even now, but they remained unaddressed. Some Members had expressed the view that the systemic concerns raised in document WT/COMTD/W/175 were outside the scope of the CTD, and needed to be discussed in the Negotiating Group on Rules (NGR). The view of his delegation was that the CTD was the appropriate forum to consider the questions arising from RTAs with a dual notification.","WTCOMTDM98.pdf","GATT, China, Egypt, India, GCC, Customs, Union, GATT, Members, CTD, CTD"

Pointing to the terms of reference of the CTD contained in document WT/L/46, he noted that the CTD was designated to serve as a focal point for consideration and coordination of work on development in the WTO and its relationship to development-related activities in other multilateral agencies. He added that the Committee could consult with other WTO bodies in addressing the systemic concerns raised in document WT/COMTD/W/175. This was in keeping with paragraph 3 of the CTD's terms of reference which entrusted the Committee to review periodically, in consultation as appropriate with the relevant bodies of the WTO, the application of special provisions in the Multilateral Trade Agreements and related Ministerial Decisions in favour of developing country Members, and in particular least developed country (LDC) Members, and report to the General Council for appropriate action. In concluding, he indicated that the first three sub-items under the present agenda item needed to remain on the CTD's agenda until the systemic and specific concerns arising from ""dually notified"" RTAs were addressed. He also requested the Chairman to hold consultations in this regard.","WTCOMTDM98.pdf","CTD, CTD, WTO, Committee, WTO, CTD, Committee, WTO, Members, Members, General, Council, CTD, Chairman"

She recalled that the US, as well as some other Members, had indicated on many occasions that the GCC Customs Union issue was not an issue of dual notification. Her delegation continued to have concerns with the present sub-item being listed on the CTD's agenda. The sub-item had fulfilled its purpose of informing Members of the notification made, and needed to be removed from the agenda. Noting that the issue took away time, resources and attention from other pressing matters, she expressed her hope that the Committee could move forward constructively, recognizing that the GCC Customs Union was not an issue of dual notification, but rather something to be addressed in the CRTA under the Transparency Mechanism for RTAs. She urged the GCC countries to provide the Secretariat with their comments on the draft factual presentation, so that Members could benefit from transparency on the GCC Customs Union.","WTCOMTDM98.pdf","United, States, Committee, US, Members, GCC, Customs, Union, CTD, Members, Committee, GCC, Customs, Union, CRTA, GCC, Secretariat, Members, GCC, Customs, Union"

He also indicated his delegation's confusion with the language in the first paragraph of the Introduction to the report on page 2, and in particular asked whether the individual LAIA countries could explain what was meant by ""pursuant to the obligation of WTO Members to notify"" and ""without prejudice to individual notifications submitted by Members"". With respect to agreements between LAIA countries, he stressed that WTO notification obligations were on individual Members. Under the terms of the Transparency Mechanism for RTAs, it was not possible for the LAIA to notify RTAs for individual Members. In this light, he urged the LAIA countries to notify their agreements, whether they were undertaken regionally or bilaterally. He added that, if the LAIA countries were seeking some kind of regional format for notifications that would be acceptable to WTO Members, the US would welcome such a discussion and would engage constructively to find a solution. In order to ensure regional consistency and promote efficiency - while ensuring that individual Members remained responsible for their notification obligations - a solution could be as simple as deconstructing the LAIA report into agreement-by-agreement notifications that would be submitted by the parties to those agreements.","WTCOMTDM98.pdf","United, States, LAIA, WTO, Members, Members, LAIA, WTO, Members, LAIA, Members, LAIA, WTO, Members, US, Members, LAIA"

However, if the LAIA countries did not consider the report to be a notification, then they would need to comply individually with their notification obligations.

Since its inception, the GSP programme had provided duty-free access for over half-a-trillion US dollars in eligible products from developing countries. The programme had also helped to foster the further integration of developing countries into the multilateral trading system. The GSP was at the centre of the US' efforts to promote the economic development of developing countries through trade, and was complemented by substantial trade capacity-building assistance by the US to help developing countries advance economic reforms, and to increase and diversify their trade. The programme currently provided duty-free treatment for up to 5,000 products from 122 designated beneficiary countries and territories, including 43 LDCs.","WTCOMTDM98.pdf","United, States, US, GSP, GSP, GSP, US, US"
"11148",11148,"55","55.    She went on to say that the notification under consideration provided specific information on changes to country and product eligibility resulting from the last three GSP annual reviews. Among the changes in the programme, she highlighted that the US had added 12 upland cotton products to GSP eligibility for least developed beneficiary countries. This had been done in response to requests from these countries, including several cotton-producing countries in Sub-Saharan Africa. The US had also removed from GSP eligibility several products from specific countries after imports of these products exceeded statutory competitive need limitations. In addition, several countries were graduated from the GSP programme after having become high-income countries, as designated by the World Bank. One country was suspended from GSP benefits, following a multi-year review which found that it was not affording its workers internationally recognized worker rights. Although authorization of the GSP programme had lapsed from mid-2013 to mid- 2015, legislation had been enacted in June 2015 to authorize the programme through 31 December 2017. Benefits under the programme had been made retroactive through the entire period of the lapse, thereby enabling importers to seek refunds of duties paid during the lapse. The legislation that renewed the GSP programme also authorized the US President, for the first time, to consider the addition of certain travel goods for eligibility under the GSP. The potential addition of these products was currently the subject of a public review that was expected to conclude in June 2016.","WTCOMTDM98.pdf","GSP, US, GSP, Sub-Saharan, Africa, US, GSP, GSP, World, Bank, GSP, GSP, GSP, US, GSP"

In closing, she said that, while the US recognized the successes of GSP programme – which covered over US$17.4 billion in imports in 2015 – it was also committed to continue working to improve the effectiveness of efforts to integrate developing countries more fully into the global trading system. Towards that end, the US continued to work with GSP beneficiary countries to identify ways for them to improve their utilization of the programme in order to increase their exports and bolster economic development. Regular meetings with beneficiary government officials were organized, and videoconferences and teleconferences were held with trade associations and businesses in beneficiary countries.

These meetings had been useful in allowing him to better understand Members' perspectives on a number of CTD-related issues, and in particular some of the issues on the CTD's agenda on which Members had yet to agree on a way forward. He expressed his willingness to work with Members to try to find solutions. He also indicated that, during these meetings, he had been interested to hear any thoughts from Members on what types of additional work the CTD could engage in. He explained that he was looking to reinvigorate the CTD's work in the context of paragraph 29 of the Nairobi Ministerial Declaration. He remained open to continue to meet bilaterally with delegations to discuss the CTD's work, and in this regard invited interested Members to contact him. He also noted that he would consider convening informal meetings in small groups or in other configurations in order to explore ways to make progress on specific items on the CTD's agenda. Turning to the draft agenda for the CTD's 99th Session – which was contained in document WTO/AIR/COMTD/7 circulated on 28 June 2016 – he inquired whether there were any requests to add a matter under ""Other Business"". 1.8% of the tariff lines had been retained in the exclusion list, with no duty concessions. In closing, he said that his delegation’s expectation was that the Secretariat study would diagnose the critical challenges in DFQF implementation, and in particular the reasons for inadequate implementation by a few developed Members, which had an obligation to provide DFQF market access to LDCs on at least 97% of tariff lines. It was also hoped that the study would come up with options for implementing the Hong Kong and Bali DFQF decisions, taking into consideration all relevant aspects and the interests of all stakeholders.","WTCOMTDM99.pdf","Chairman, Committee, on, Trade, and, Development, Members, CTD, Members, Members, Members, CTD, CTD, Nairobi, CTD, Members, CTD, CTD, Secretariat, Members, Hong, Kong, Bali"

Another section looked at the implementation of the Technical Assistance (TA) Plan and main features of the TA provided in 2015, while a third section was concerned with the evaluation of performance in 2015. She also noted that the structure of the annual report had changed significantly relative to previous years, in response to requests from Members to align the report to the TA Plan. Turning to the main developments in 2015, she said that funding had not been an obstacle to the implementation of activities. An amount of CHF 12.5 million had been received in new contributions, while a substantial carry forward from the previous year had also facilitated implementation. The overall volume of TA activities had remained stable, although the number of national activities had fallen by 10% as a result of a reduction in the number of requests received from Members. On the other hand, the number of regional and global activities had increased by 5% as compared to 2014. A total of 269 activities were delivered, and the Secretariat was also involved in 49 other activities. With regard to the implementation of results-based management (RBM), some progress had been recorded, in spite of a lack of sufficient resources dedicated to RBM. The Secretariat was pursuing further work on measuring results using objective performance indicators. Improvements were also being made in the course content and offer, based on Members' needs and priorities.","WTCOMTDM99.pdf","Director, ITTC, Members, Members, Secretariat, RBM, Secretariat, Members"

He expressed appreciation to Members implementing PTAs for the information reflected in the database, and also called on them to ensure that this information was kept up to date. He observed that, for some Members implementing PTAs in favour of LDC products, a large proportion of tariffs were already duty-free on a most-favoured-nation (MFN) basis. This caused difficulties for LDCs trying to compete in these markets. In addition, he wondered why beneficiaries of PTAs sometimes exported under the MFN regime rather than under the preferential regime.","WTCOMTDM99.pdf","Benin, LDC, Group, Members, Members, MFN, LDCs, MFN"

Before turning to the two sub-items, he said that he wished to take the opportunity to remind Members that, as per the Bali Decision on DFQF market access for LDCs, the Secretariat would need to prepare an updated report on Members' DFQF market access for the CTD's annual DFQF review. This review would take place at the next CTD meeting.

He recalled that the first table contained information on developed Members' DFQF schemes, while the second contained information on developing Members' DFQF schemes. With regard to the developed Members, he informed the Committee that the Secretariat had received all 2016 tariff data except with respect to Iceland and Japan. The data indicated that the situation remained similar to what was described in the 2015 Secretariat report, with most developed Members providing full or significant DFQF market access. Similar to what was reported in the 2015 report, the number of dutiable lines was somewhat higher for Iceland – although the figure of 91.8% DFQF coverage was from 2014 – and the US, with a DFQF coverage of 82.6%. The Russian Federation's GSP sub-scheme for LDCs allowed duty-free access to 37.1% of tariff lines in 2016. Turning to the developing Members, he said that data for the year 2016 had not yet been provided by China, India, the Kyrgyz Republic, Tajikistan, Thailand and Turkey. With respect to the developing Members that had provided 2016 data, he said that the situation remained unchanged relative to what was described in the 2015 Secretariat report. In particular, Chile's DFQF coverage remained at 99.5%, Korea's coverage remained at","WTCOMTDM99.pdf","Economic, Research, and, Statistics, Division, Bali, Secretariat, Members, Secretariat, Members, Members, Members, Committee, Secretariat, Iceland, Japan, Secretariat, Members, Iceland, US, Russian, Federation, LDCs, Members, China, India, Kyrgyz, Republic, Tajikistan, Thailand, Turkey, Members, Secretariat, Chile, Korea"

In this context, he informed the Committee that, as of 1 July 2016, new duty-free status had been added for a range of travel goods – including luggage, backpacks, handbags, and wallets – for Least Developed Beneficiary Developing Countries (LDBDCs) of the US' GSP scheme, as well as for African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA) countries. The products which had been added to the scope of the two programmes included leather or textile-covered briefcases, handbags, wallets and travel bags, which had been excluded from GSP benefits since the 1970s. The MFN tariffs on these products ranged from 4.5% to 20%. Providing duty-free treatment for these products to LDC beneficiaries and AGOA countries was an important decision from a development perspective, as travel goods were important products to encourage further development of LDC textile industries. The US had approached this decision with the goal of maximum impact for development and poverty alleviation, pursuant to the aim of the GSP scheme. It was believed that duty-free treatment for these products to LDBDCs and AGOA countries would provide a significant boost to these countries’ efforts to increase and diversify their exports. The US Trade Representative (USTR) had noted that trade preference programmes such as GSP and AGOA could make a powerful contribution to lifting people out of poverty and supporting growth in some of the poorest countries in the world. The USTR had also indicated that the US had used these programmes to give beneficiary countries vital assistance vis-à-vis more advanced competitors. Overall, LDBDC exports of these products to the US had risen from US$6.7 million in 2013 to US$51.4 million in 2015. This improvement was yet another demonstration of the US' commitment to faithfully implement the Bali Decision to improve existing DFQF coverage for products originating from LDCs, so as to provide increasingly greater market access to LDCs.","WTCOMTDM99.pdf","United, States, US, GSP, Committee, US, AGOA, GSP, MFN, AGOA, US, GSP, AGOA, US, USTR, GSP, AGOA, USTR, US, US, US, Bali"

About 43% of the participants were women. As in previous years, priority continued to be given to Africa and to least developed countries (LDCs). Of the 269 activities, 39% were global activities organized in Geneva, and 19% of activities were organized in partnership with other organizations. Technical assistance was predominately delivered through national activities. In terms of subject coverage, 115 of the activities had a general scope. The most popular subjects were market access for goods, sanitary and phytosanitary (SPS) measures, and services. About 70% of the activities were delivered in English, 18% in French and 12% in Spanish. In the context of the Progressive Learning Strategy (PLS), the highest number of activities were organized at the intermediate level.

Recalling the discussion that had taken place at the CTD's 96th Session on the merits of a clinical examination of DFQF implementation, he indicated that the submission under consideration presented the draft terms of reference for such an examination, to be carried out by the Secretariat. He believed that all Members, and not only LDCs, needed to play their part in the process. He went on to say that the submission was divided into four sections. The first section provided background information on the clinical examination, emphasizing the legal foundations of DFQF market access and the decision-making procedure for conducting the examination. The second section set out the 11 parameters selected by the LDCs to direct the clinical examination. The third section proposed a methodological approach for the examination, while the fourth section suggested a timeframe for the preparation of the examination. According to the timeframe, the results of the Secretariat study would need to be made available no later than two months after the present meeting.

The representative of Morocco, on behalf of the African Group, expressed appreciation for the recent initiative by the US to add new duty-free status for a range of travel goods for LDBDCs of the GSP scheme, and for AGOA countries. He believed that this was yet another step in the right direction to further help AGOA beneficiaries and LDCs integrate into the multilateral trading system. He elaborated on how AGOA had contributed positively to Africa’s textiles and clothing industry, and in this regard expressed concern that the industry was threatened by the implementation of the Trans-Pacific Partnership Agreement, which would extend many of the same benefits to Africa’s competitors. It was for this reason that the African Group supported the submission contained in document WT/COMTD/W/218. He noted that the Group was especially drawn to parameters 10 and 11, particularly with respect to the extent of preference erosion as a consequence of the entry into force of the Trans-Pacific Partnership Agreement.","WTCOMTDM99.pdf","Morocco, African, Group, US, GSP, AGOA, AGOA, LDCs, AGOA, Africa, Africa, African, Group, Group"

The representative of the United States recalled that his delegation had expressed openness to review a proposal on the parameters for a possible Secretariat study on DFQF implementation, when the idea had first been raised. However, the US had also cautioned that Members should not expect the Secretariat to be able to illuminate or resolve the well-known differences of views on this complicated issue. It had also been specified that a report from the Secretariat needed to be balanced and fact-based, and could not include any subjective assessments or suggestions of any particular policy directions. While commending the LDC Group for working to move this work forward, he said that it was clear, both implicitly and explicitly, that the proposed terms of reference sought to single out the US market and certain products of interest, rather than take a comprehensive approach. He regretted that the LDC Group had not attempted to work or consult with his delegation in an effort to produce a document that could achieve consensus. The US was not in a position to support the terms of reference proposed by the LDC Group, and had concerns about the type of analysis that was being proposed. The US had made great efforts to implement the commitment made at the Bali Ministerial Conference to improve DFQF market access for LDCs, and would continue to make such efforts. In closing, he indicated that his delegation stood ready to consult with the LDC Group on this issue.","WTCOMTDM99.pdf","United, States, Secretariat, US, Members, Secretariat, Secretariat, LDC, Group, US, LDC, Group, US, LDC, Group, US, Bali, Ministerial, Conference, LDC, Group"

At the output level, the target was fully met for 62% of the indicators chosen. This included a number of cases where the target was significantly exceeded. There were 14% of cases where the target was partially met, and 14% where the target was not met. In 10% of the cases, data were not available to draw an informed conclusion. She noted that corrective measures had been introduced to address the data issue. In directing Members to the summary of results on pages 56 to 58 of the report, she cautioned that not all the results could be attributed to the WTO's TA, particularly at the outcome level. Furthermore, given that this was the first attempt to compile such information, a certain amount of trial and error was to be expected. She explained that the indicators initially chosen in the TA Plan had not always                                          WT/COMTD/M/99                                                 -4- proven relevant to measure results, and the targets identified in the Plan were sometimes unrealistic.

He said that China attached great importance to the implementation of DFQF market access for LDCs, and had been providing 97% DFQF access since 2015. However, he also emphasized that it was necessary to acknowledge essential differences in the responsibilities of developed and developing Members in this regard. Developing Members provided DFQF market access on voluntary basis, and faced                                          WT/COMTD/M/99                                                - 19 - more challenges in their economic development than developed Members. In this light, developing Members’ commitments could not be measured in the same way as for developed Members. The principle of ""common but differentiated responsibilities"" needed to be fully observed in the clinical examination. Not doing so could also discourage those developing Members that were considering providing DFQF market access to LDCs.","WTCOMTDM99.pdf","China, China, Members, Members, Members, Members, Members, Members"

He recalled that the idea for a clinical examination of DFQF implementation had been proposed at the 96 th Session. However, owing to a lack of consensus on the parameters, the Secretariat had not been able to proceed with the study. He went on to say that, according to the Hong Kong DFQF Decision, developed Members were required to provide DFQF market access to LDCs on at least 97% of tariff lines. In this context, he referred to the Secretariat report contained in document WT/COMTD/W/214, and noted that three developed Members were yet to implement the Decision. For developing Members, on the other hand, the provision of DFQF market access was voluntary. Developing Members were also permitted to phase in their commitments and enjoy appropriate flexibility in coverage. He informed the Committee that, in 2008, India became the first developing Member to announce a comprehensive scheme to provide DFQF market access to LDCs. India’s DFTP Scheme now provided duty-free market access on 96% of India’s tariff lines at 6-digit level of the Harmonized System, while an additional 2.2% of lines enjoyed preferential duties.

These included: increasing the value added and manufactured component of LLDC exports; strengthening of economic and financial ties between LLDCs and other countries in the same region so as to increase the share of LLDCs in intraregional trade; further simplifying, harmonizing and streamlining border crossing and transit procedures, while improving transit facilities and their efficiency; and ensuring that all transit regulations, formalities and procedures for traffic in transit were published and updated in accordance with the WTO Trade Facilitation Agreement (TFA).

It was envisaged that such a Work Programme would address the special needs, challenges and vulnerabilities of LLDCs in order to increase their participation in the multilateral trading system. Key areas of work would include trade facilitation, agriculture, Aid for Trade, services and accession. The Work Programme would help the LLDCs to have a stronger and more coordinated voice in the WTO, particularly on issues which contributed to reducing trade transaction costs. It would be a useful platform to analyze the challenges that LLDCs faced in their integration into global and regional value chains. In closing, he clarified that the Work Programme would not seek to create a new category of membership. A concept note and a draft proposal would be presented to Members in due course, so as to have the Work Programme as one of the deliverables for the Eleventh Ministerial Conference (MC11).","WTCOMTDM99.pdf","LLDCs, WTO, LLDCs, Work, Programme, LLDCs, WTO, LLDCs, Work, Programme, Members, Work, Programme"

She went on to say that the evaluation was on track. The evaluators had already visited Benin, and would be visiting Lao People's Democratic Republic, Paraguay, Morocco, Iran, Botswana and Jamaica in the coming weeks. Surveys were being sent out to partner countries. It was expected that the draft evaluation report would be delivered to the Steering Committee for comments by the end of August, and that the final evaluation report would be approved by the Steering Committee by the end of October.

The Chairman recalled that, at the Eighth Ministerial Conference (MC8), Ministers had, inter alia, reaffirmed the positive link between trade and development and called for focused work in the CTD. Ministers had called on Members to fully operationalize the mandate of the CTD as a focal point for development work. He recalled that, at the 97th Session, the Committee had agreed to the proposal from Ecuador contained in document WT/COMTD/W/204/Rev.1, which had been submitted in the context of the CTD's mandate from MC8. The proposal was for the Secretariat to periodically update its paper on the implementation of special and differential treatment (S&D) provisions in the WTO Agreements and Decisions. Since the updated Secretariat document would be circulated soon, he said that he wished to remind Members of some elements of the proposal from Ecuador that had been agreed to. He noted firstly that the purpose of the Secretariat report was to serve as a reference document for Members, for use as they deemed necessary. In addition, if a Member wished to propose that any particular element in the report be used as the basis for the inclusion of an agenda item at a CTD meeting, that Member would need to explain in its request the scope and purpose of the proposed discussion.","WTCOMTDM99.pdf","Chairman, CTD, Members, CTD, Committee, Ecuador, CTD, Secretariat, WTO, Secretariat, Members, Ecuador, Secretariat, Members, Member, CTD, Member"

Turning to the two proposals for work under the MC8 mandate that were to be considered at the present meeting, he observed that the submissions containing these proposals had been appearing on the CTD’s agenda for quite some time. Previous CTD Chairpersons had held informal consultations to try to make progress on the proposals, but the situation remained unchanged. The proponents had been called upon to initiate informal discussions with other delegations in order to move the process forward. He hoped that some progress could be reported at the present meeting.       -     Committee on Trade and Development mandate: focal point for consideration and             coordination of work on development in the WTO – proposal from Barbados, Belize,             China, Cuba, Ecuador, India, and the African Group (WT/COMTD/W/208)","WTCOMTDM99.pdf","CTD, Committee, on, Trade, and, Development, WTO, Barbados, Belize, China, Cuba, Ecuador, India, African, Group"
"11261",11261,"36","36.    The Chairman said that the proposal contained in document WT/COMTD/W/208 had the aim for the CTD to report on development-related work taking place in the WTO. He recalled that there were originally two proposals which broadly had this aim, and that the proponents of the two proposals had decided to work together. Document WT/COMTD/W/208 was the outcome of this collaboration.","WTCOMTDM99.pdf","Chairman, CTD, WTO"
"11262",11262,"37","37.    The representative of India recalled the mandate from MC8 and noted that the CTD had been reporting annually to the General Council even before MC8, as had other subsidiary bodies of the General Council. Therefore, in giving their instructions at MC8, Ministers had wanted more from the CTD than its annual report. The CTD was a special body in the WTO. It was the focal point for the consideration and coordination of development-related work, and therefore had an overarching mandate. His delegation believed that it was appropriate for the CTD to report regularly on the development-related work that was taking place in other WTO bodies and provide the necessary recommendations to the General Council on achieving better coordination within the WTO on development issues. He noted that there was not much progress to report on this matter since the last meeting, and requested the Chairman to continue to hold informal consultations.

"11263",11263,"38","38.    The representative of Morocco, on behalf of the African Group, said that his intervention related to both sub-items under the present agenda item. He believed that part of the reason why the two sub-items remained on the CTD's agenda was because of the challenges that existed in terms of reporting and coordination on development in the WTO. The relationship between trade and development was one of the central pillars of the GATT, as well as the Marrakesh Agreement Establishing the WTO, and the CTD had been established as the focal point for development work in the WTO. However, relevant decisions taken by other WTO bodies had not been regularly reported to the CTD, nor had the CTD been consulted on a range of development-related issues that had been taken up by these bodies. In this context, he recalled the mandate from MC8, and indicated his disappointment that Ministers' instructions were not being followed. He expressed concern with the precedent that was being set. Turning to the two remaining proposals under consideration, he explained that the objective was to reorient and refocus the work of the CTD. It was important to improve intra-reporting procedures and operationalize the CTD’s terms of reference by periodically reviewing the development-related work taking place in other WTO bodies, including negotiating bodies. The CTD would, in turn, provide guidance and appropriate recommendations to the General Council and to other WTO bodies on any development-related work. This would better link development to trade in a manner that would contribute to the economic development of the WTO’s developing, least developed, and small and vulnerable constituencies.","WTCOMTDM99.pdf","Morocco, African, Group, CTD, WTO, GATT, WTO, CTD, WTO, WTO, CTD, CTD, CTD, CTD, WTO, CTD, General, Council, WTO, WTO"

He suggested that the Chairman could hold informal consultations in order to make progress on the proposals. With regard specifically to the issue of ""dually notified"" regional trade agreements (RTAs), he said that the role of the CTD in reviewing RTAs notified under the Enabling Clause needed be respected. He suggested that the CTD Chairman could organize and chair a joint meeting of the CTD and the Committee on Regional Trade Agreements (CRTA) in order to review the ""dually notified"" RTAs. He also encouraged Members to jointly notify their RTAs in the future. Finally, he called on Members to take concrete action to fulfil the mandate in Paragraph 28 of the Nairobi Ministerial Declaration.","WTCOMTDM99.pdf","China, India, Morocco, Barbados, CTD, Chairman, CTD, CTD, Chairman, CTD, Committee, CRTA, Members, Members, Nairobi"

With regard to the remaining proposals contained in documents WT/COMTD/W/208 and WT/COMTD/W/192, he said that these proposals had been on the table for several years, and Members were no closer to achieving consensus than when they were first addressed in the Committee. The proponents had acknowledged this, and his delegation was not aware of any outreach efforts to address the concerns that had been raised. In this light, he questioned the value of maintaining the two proposals on the agenda. While inviting the proponents to submit revised proposals if they wished, he noted that a repetition of the same discussion at each CTD meeting stood in opposition to the Chairman's desire to reinvigorate the work of the Committee.","WTCOMTDM99.pdf","United, States, Committee, Ecuador, Members, Committee, CTD, Chairman, Committee"

"11270",11270,"44","44.    The representative of the European Union recalled her delegation's view that the CTD should further explore the positive link between trade and development in order to implement the MC8 mandate. This needed to be based on constructive discussions on clearly identified topics, in line with the instructions from MC8 to carry out focused work. While the proposals that had been agreed to so far were in line with this requirement, the remaining proposals were not. She was also not aware of any efforts on the part of the proponents to take into consideration other Members' comments and concerns. The proposal for the CTD to report on development-related work taking place in other WTO bodies would give the CTD an oversight function for development issues in all aspects of the WTO's work. This went against the CTD's mandate to act as a focal point on development issues and carry out focused work. Members needed to debate what this focused work should be, and not re-open the CTD's mandate. As for the remaining proposal contained in document WT/COMTD/W/192, she observed that the issue of RTAs with a dual notification should be part of the wider discussion on the implementation of paragraph 28 of the Nairobi Ministerial Declaration. While the Chairman of the CRTA had acknowledged at the CRTA meeting of 27 June that it was unclear where such a negotiation should take place, the CRTA Chairman had also stated that it would be helpful for the CRTA and the CTD to work together in a more structured way – both in terms of the systemic discussion on RTAs, and with respect to the regular work of examining RTAs. In closing, she said that her delegation was ready to have constructive discussions with a view to clarifying issues relating to notifications, and in this context could support joint meetings of the CRTA and CTD.","WTCOMTDM99.pdf","European, Union, CTD, Members, CTD, WTO, CTD, WTO, CTD, Members, CTD, Nairobi, Chairman, CRTA, CRTA, CRTA, Chairman, CRTA, CTD, CRTA, CTD"

"11288",11288,"60","60.   The Chairman said that the first sub-item under the present agenda item concerned the GCC Customs Union notification. The sub-item also referred to the communication from China, Egypt and India which was circulated in document WT/COMTD/W/175.","WTCOMTDM99.pdf","Chairman, GCC, Customs, Union, China, Egypt, India"
"11289",11289,"61","61.    The representative of India indicated that his intervention related to the first three sub-items under the present agenda item, since the three RTAs referenced in these sub-items had been ""dually notified"" under both the Enabling Clause and GATT Article XXIV. His delegation presumed that, in a rules-based multilateral trading system, there would be uniformity in dealing with the three RTAs. The Transparency Mechanism for RTAs did not differentiate between customs unions and other forms of RTAs, and the three RTAs in question were therefore similarly situated. It would serve no purpose for Members to find distinctions between the three RTAs. He noted that the systemic concerns that were raised by China, Egypt and India over the legal and procedural implications of the dual notification of the GCC Customs Union under both the Enabling Clause and GATT Article XXIV were pertinent even now, but they remained unaddressed. The systemic concerns related to the Enabling Clause, the mandate and terms of reference of the CTD, and the RTA Transparency Mechanism. Specific concerns related to the procedures for consideration of the GCC Customs Union. Some Members had expressed the view that the systemic concerns raised in document WT/COMTD/W/175 were outside the scope of the CTD, and needed to be discussed in the Negotiating Group on Rules (NGR). The view of his delegation was that the CTD was the appropriate forum to consider the questions arising from RTAs with a dual notification.","WTCOMTDM99.pdf","GATT, Members, China, Egypt, India, GCC, Customs, Union, GATT, CTD, RTA, GCC, Customs, Union, Members, CTD, CTD"
"11290",11290,"62","62.    Pointing to the terms of reference of the CTD contained in document WT/L/46, he noted that the CTD was designated to serve as a focal point for consideration and coordination of work on development in the WTO and its relationship to development-related activities in other multilateral agencies. He added that the Committee could consult with other WTO bodies in addressing the systemic concerns raised in document WT/COMTD/W/175. This was in keeping with paragraph 3 of the CTD's terms of reference which entrusted the Committee to review periodically, in consultation as appropriate with the relevant bodies of the WTO, the application of special provisions in the Multilateral Trade Agreements and related Ministerial Decisions in favour of developing country Members, and in particular LDC Members, and report to the General Council for appropriate action. In concluding, he indicated that the three sub-items under the present agenda item needed to remain on the CTD's agenda until the systemic and specific concerns arising from ""dually notified"" RTAs were addressed. He also requested the Chairman to hold consultations in this regard.","WTCOMTDM99.pdf","CTD, CTD, WTO, Committee, WTO, CTD, Committee, WTO, Members, Members, General, Council, CTD, Chairman"
"11291",11291,"63","63.   The representative of the United States said that his delegation continued to have concerns with the present sub-item being listed on the agenda. This sub-item had fulfilled its purpose of informing Members of the notification made, and needed to be removed from the agenda. He regretted that this issue had taken so much of the Committee’s time over the past few years. These were the types of issues that took time, resources, and attention away from other useful work that the CTD could be doing, and posed a hindrance to the Chairman's efforts to reinvigorate the work of the Committee. The United States (US) had stated its position on this issue clearly and there was no need to rehash those points at the present meeting. He expressed hope that Members could move forward constructively, recognizing that the GCC Customs Union was not an issue of dual notification, but rather something to be addressed in the CRTA under the RTA Transparency Mechanism. He also urged the GCC parties to provide the Secretariat with their comments on the draft factual presentation that had been sent to them, so that Members could benefit from some level of transparency on the GCC Customs Union.","WTCOMTDM99.pdf","United, States, Members, Committee, CTD, Chairman, Committee, United, States, US, Members, GCC, Customs, Union, CRTA, RTA, GCC, Secretariat, Members, GCC, Customs, Union"
"11292",11292,"64","64.    He went on to say that the GCC Customs Union had been incorrectly notified as an Enabling Clause Agreement. This was subsequently corrected, and the agreement was in the pipeline to be reviewed in the CRTA, in line with the procedures of the RTA Transparency Mechanism. The US considered this issue closed, and continued to request that it be removed from the CTD's agenda. His delegation wished to be very clear that it had no quarrel with any developing country notifying a qualifying agreement under the Enabling Clause. This was not what GCC Customs Union notification issue was about. As this agreement was a customs union, the notification was different from non-customs union RTA notifications. The US had explained its arguments on this agreement in detail over the past few years, and found it of little utility to continue to rehash these points. He hoped that the CTD could move beyond this issue and focus on other work.

"11293",11293,"65","65.    The representative of the European Union said that her delegation considered it important to clarify the legal and procedural questions arising from an RTA being notified by each party under a different legal provision. She emphasized the need to find a pragmatic solution for the notifications in question, and indicated that any substantive discussion had to take place in the framework of the implementation of paragraph 28 of the Nairobi Ministerial Declaration. However, she noted that a clear distinction needed to be drawn between the ASEAN-Korea and India-Korea Agreements on the one hand, and the GCC Customs Union on the other. With regard to the ASEAN-Korea and India-Korea Agreements, she regretted that the parties had been unable to find a solution. The European Union (EU) agreed with Korea's position that, even when developing countries notified their RTAs under GATT Article XXIV, this did not undermine the Enabling Clause or the CTD. In this light, the EU invited the parties to these agreements to make an additional effort to find an acceptable solution. She went on to say that the GCC Customs Union notification was a different case. As had been stated at previous meetings, the EU's position was that a custom union could not be notified under the Enabling Clause, and that GATT Article XXIV was the only legal basis for the notification of custom unions. The fact that the GCC parties had not as yet withdrawn their notification under the Enabling Clause created doubts regarding the possibility of maintaining notifications under two different legal provisions. Her delegation urged the GCC parties to withdraw their notification under the Enabling Clause. In closing, she reiterated her delegation’s availability to discuss a pragmatic solution.","WTCOMTDM99.pdf","European, Union, RTA, Nairobi, India-Korea, GCC, Customs, Union, India-Korea, EU, Korea, GATT, CTD, EU, GCC, Customs, Union, EU, GATT, GCC, GCC"

The sub-items had fulfilled their purpose of informing Members of the notifications made, and needed to be removed from the agenda. With respect to the issue of ""dual notifications"", he indicated that this was directly linked to the functioning of the Transparency Mechanism for RTAs, and went beyond the mandate of the CTD.

The representative of Bolivia, on behalf of the LAIA, referred to the documents from the LAIA which were circulated annually to the CTD with the title ""Report to the WTO on instruments concluded under the 1980 Treaty of Montevideo"". He said that these reports could be used by LAIA member countries to meet their notification obligations in respect of instruments concluded under paragraph 4(a) of the Enabling Clause, in accordance with sections D to G of the Transparency Mechanism for RTAs, and without prejudice to notifications submitted individually by LAIA member countries. He added that, in the annual reports to the WTO, each of the LAIA member countries acted in an individual capacity regarding the agreements they concluded under the 1980 Treaty of Montevideo (TM80), as was clear from the introduction to these reports and the individual notification datasheets which were included.","WTCOMTDM99.pdf","Bolivia, LAIA, CTD, WTO, Montevideo, LAIA, LAIA, WTO, LAIA, Montevideo"
"11312",11312,"82","82.   He went on to say that that the TM80 was notified to the GATT as an RTA under the Enabling Clause on 1 July 1982 in document L/5342. Since that time, LAIA member countries – without prejudice to the individual notifications submitted to the CTD or to CRTA – had notified the GATT or WTO in a consistent and uniform manner of any agreements concluded under the TM80. This had been done in the biennial reports submitted between 1980 and 2011, and in the annual reports from 2012 onwards, so as to comply with the RTA Transparency Mechanism. The regional scope and partial scope agreements concluded between LAIA member countries were included in the mechanisms provided for in Article 4 of the TM80, which sought to make viable the achievement of the countries' long-term objectives. These mechanisms were therefore legal instruments that affected the implementation of an RTA or the operation of an RTA already implemented, as laid out in section D of the RTA Transparency Mechanism, which concerned subsequent notification and reporting. Consequently, the WTO Secretariat was not required to prepare factual presentations, as was the case with agreements notified under section B of the Transparency Mechanism. However, if any WTO Member required further information on any                                           WT/COMTD/M/99                                                 - 13 - particular aspect of agreements concluded under the TM80, he noted that paragraph 16 of the Transparency Mechanism provided the opportunity to exchange views in a dedicated session of the CTD.","WTCOMTDM99.pdf","GATT, RTA, LAIA, CTD, CRTA, GATT, WTO, RTA, LAIA, RTA, RTA, RTA, WTO, Secretariat, WTO, Member, CTD"
"11313",11313,"83","83.    In light of the information provided, and with a view to contributing to the transparency of the notification process with respect to agreements concluded under the TM80, the CTD Chairman was requested to forward the communication to the WTO Secretariat, and to Members in the CTD and the CRTA. Furthermore, the LAIA countries believed that the WTO Secretariat should circulate the documents with the title ""Report to the WTO on instruments concluded under the 1980 Treaty of Montevideo"" with the document symbol ""WT/COMTD/N/--"", like notifications made within the framework of the CTD. He next referred to the CRTA document WT/REG/W/100/Rev.1, which contained a list of RTAs that had appeared in factual presentations and had not yet been notified to the WTO. He indicated that the WTO Secretariat should remove from this list – as well as subsequent revisions of this list – all the agreements between LAIA member countries that were duly notified under the paragraph 4(a) of the Enabling Clause, in accordance with sections D to G of the RTA Transparency Mechanism. The RTAs in question were listed in the communication under consideration.","WTCOMTDM99.pdf","CTD, Chairman, WTO, Secretariat, Members, CTD, CRTA, LAIA, WTO, Secretariat, WTO, Montevideo, CRTA, WTO, WTO, Secretariat, LAIA, RTA, Transparency, Mechanism"
"11314",11314,"84","84.    The representative of the United States said that his delegation had previously made statements in the CTD and the CRTA with the purpose of seeking to resolve the matter of the large number of non-notified LAIA agreements. The non-notification of RTAs was a significant and growing concern. While the issue was not limited to the LAIA agreements, these agreements represented the majority of the RTAs listed in the Secretariat’s compilation of non-notified agreements. He also referred to a room document circulated by the Secretariat in the CRTA which showed that there were 97 separate LAIA agreements in force. Some of these had been notified to the WTO as required, but most had not. The notification of the TM80 was not sufficient, especially since the treaty itself made clear that the arrangements entered under it were not modifications to the umbrella agreement, but were separate agreements. The TM80 specifically provided for regional and partial scope agreements, and did not appear to say anything about the specific treatment to be given to any product or class of products by any signatory. The reports submitted by the LAIA countries to the CTD were also not sufficient in terms of a notification. The LAIA reports had no standing in the WTO, nor could they replace Members' individual obligations. He highlighted the importance of Latin America as a regional market, and in this light emphasized the need for greater transparency, so as to allow a better understanding of the progress toward regional integration that had been achieved.","WTCOMTDM99.pdf","United, States, CTD, CRTA, Secretariat, Secretariat, CRTA, WTO, LAIA, CTD, LAIA, WTO, Members, Latin, America"
"11315",11315,"85","85.     He went on to say that the notification requirements and the obligations found in the RTA Transparency Mechanism – including the provision of data to support the Secretariat’s work in preparing the factual presentations – fell squarely on individual WTO Members, and could not be shifted to a non-WTO Member. While drafting assistance by the Secretariat might be helpful, the notifications would need to be issued by the individual WTO Members that were parties to the agreements, since notifications were the obligation of Members. If the LAIA parties were concerned about the administrative burden of facing a large number of factual presentations all at once after the notifications were made, his delegation had previously indicated that it would be supportive of a discussion on how the notifications might be treated, including through the preparation of factual abstracts for some agreements. He noted that the LAIA parties had not properly notified the mass of agreements that fell under the TM80, and they therefore had not been able to take advantage of flexibilities when the RTA Transparency Mechanism was first established. If notifications were made, the US was open to revisiting whether some kind of flexibility could be introduced to streamline the work. He noted that the LAIA parties had as yet not responded or reacted to these suggestions, and his delegation welcomed reactions at the present meeting.","WTCOMTDM99.pdf","Secretariat, WTO, Members, Member, Secretariat, WTO, Members, Members, LAIA, LAIA, RTA, US, LAIA"
"11316",11316,"86","86.    He added that WTO Members should be able to pose questions regarding notifications, or regarding agreements that they believed should be notified. Consistent with the RTA Transparency Mechanism, these Members should receive responses from the parties to such RTAs. The US had a long and consistent record of posing notification questions to other Members. In the case of many Latin American agreements, the responses received referred to LAIA practice, or a LAIA position, which indicated that some Members believed they could sidestep notification obligations by claiming that the decision and responsibility for notification fell to a regional organization that was not a WTO Member. He noted that this did not support transparency. He also recalled that individual Members were required to submit data to the Secretariat and were subsequently                                          WT/COMTD/M/99                                                - 14 - provided an opportunity to review and comment on draft factual presentations before they were circulated. In this regard, he asked how Committee work could be carried out if the Members that attended Committee meetings deferred these responsibilities to a non-WTO Member. Additionally, in cases where other Members had questions about the content of the LAIA reports, he queried how individual LAIA countries would be in a position to respond, if they did not participate in the drafting of the reports.","WTCOMTDM99.pdf","WTO, Members, RTA, Members, US, Members, LAIA, Members, WTO, Member, Members, Secretariat, Committee, Members, Committee, Member, Members, LAIA"

"11318",11318,"88","88.   The representative of the European Union indicated that, while the communication from LAIA was a first step, her delegation still had a number of questions with respect to the LAIA agreements. She firstly asked the LAIA parties to clarify the exact coverage of the listed agreements. She explained in this regard that it was important to understand which of the agreements, if any, could be considered as a mere implementation of the TM80, and which of them needed to be considered as additional agreements which would merit a separate treatment. She also emphasized that any RTA that contained a form of preferential treatment, as set out in section B.3 of the RTA Transparency Mechanism, was subject to the full examination process. Accessions occurring at a later stage fell under the provisions of section B of the RTA Transparency Mechanism, which meant that factual presentations needed to be prepared. As her second question, she asked the LAIA parties to clarify whether all the listed agreements in the LAIA communication, in all three columns, covered only trade in goods. She noted that agreements that covered trade in services would need to be considered in the CRTA, since they did not fall under the Enabling Clause. Finally, she requested clarification on the differences between what were termed in the communication as ""regional agreements"", ""economic complementarity agreements"", and ""other agreements"". She also indicated that her delegation would be submitting written questions shortly.","WTCOMTDM99.pdf","European, Union, LAIA, LAIA, LAIA, RTA, RTA, RTA, LAIA, LAIA, CRTA"
"11319",11319,"89","89.    The representative of Australia said that his delegation placed a high value on RTA-related information provided to the WTO. It was Members' individual and collective responsibility to ensure that there was a high degree of visibility in the trade commitments that were made outside of the multilateral trading system. His delegation believed that every Member deserved to be fully informed of any new and significant trade commitments that were made by other Members in any context. The preparation of factual presentations and their examination was the preferred format for such an exercise. He emphasized that the notification of RTA-related information needed to be taken just as seriously as any other notification and transparency obligations in the WTO system. Despite this, his delegation recognized that there were clear differences of views between Members on the nature and the extent of the notification obligations relating to their RTAs. He expressed hope that Members with strong positions on these issues would engage in more targeted and constructive discussions. He suggested that discussions should focus on how Members could work to bridge any notification gaps. The discussions would need to guide Members on where assistance might be required to support compliance with the RTA Transparency Mechanism or any other relevant notification obligations.","WTCOMTDM99.pdf","Australia, WTO, Members, Member, Members, WTO, Members, Members, Members, Members, RTA"

He said that regional and partial scope agreements concluded between LAIA member countries were part of a mechanism foreseen under Article 4 of the TM80. As such, they constituted legal instruments that affected the application or functioning of an RTA. There was therefore no requirement for the preparation of factual presentations. He reaffirmed that the LAIA member countries had notified in a constant and uniform manner the progress in the implementation of the TM80 – initially in the biennial reports, and since 2012 in annual reports.

"11329",11329,"98","98.     The Chairman said that the WTO's Database on PTAs (http://ptadb.wto.org) was set up as an outcome of the General Council Decision of 14 December 2010 – contained in document WT/L/806 – which established the Transparency Mechanism for PTAs. He believed that the database was useful in what it set out to do, namely to provide information – including trade and tariff data – on the PTAs being implemented by Members. He said that he was encouraged when he heard that the Secretariat had made further improvements to the database, particularly with respect to the presentation of the trade data. He had therefore invited the Secretariat to the present meeting to show these improvements to the Committee. Before giving the floor to the Secretariat, he noted that, while the Database on PTAs was certainly useful, it could only achieve its full potential if Members implementing PTAs provided all the necessary updated information and data to the Secretariat. He therefore encouraged all Members implementing PTAs to check what information concerning their PTAs was already in the database, and what information was missing, and to contact the Secretariat if any clarification was required in this regard. With these words, he invited a representative of the Economic Research and Statistics Division to make a presentation.","WTCOMTDM99.pdf","Chairman, WTO, General, Council, Decision, Members, Secretariat, Secretariat, Committee, Secretariat, Members, Secretariat, Members, Secretariat, Economic, Research, and, Statistics, Division"
"11330",11330,"99","99.    The representative of the Economic Research and Statistics Division began his presentation by providing a broad overview of the Database on PTAs. He noted, inter alia, that the database had been set up with the intention of providing comprehensive information on each PTA being implemented by Members – including information relating to legal texts, the beneficiaries, relevant WTO documents, and trade and tariff data. After demonstrating how the various types of information could be accessed from the database, he proceeded to outline the improvements that had recently been made by the Secretariat. He recalled firstly that the Transparency Mechanism for PTAs required Members implementing PTAs to provide data to the Secretariat on imports entering under each preferential scheme. The Database on PTAs had, since its establishment, reported this import data on an aggregate basis, where available. With the improvements, it was now possible to access data on imports entering under each preferential scheme at a more disaggregated level. In particular, the database now provided statistics separately on imports of agricultural products and non-agricultural products, as well as imports under each of the Multilateral Trade Negotiations categories. It was also possible to access information on imports from each individual beneficiary of a preferential scheme. He noted that the improvements allowed a more in-depth exploration of how the preferences granted under each PTA were being utilized. In closing, he noted that information on PTAs, including the improvements he had just outlined, could only be reflected in the database if Members implementing PTAs provided the Secretariat with the                                         WT/COMTD/M/99                                               - 16 - necessary information and data. He invited these Members to contact him if any clarifications were required in this regard.","WTCOMTDM99.pdf","Economic, Research, and, Statistics, Division, PTA, Members, WTO, Secretariat, Members, Secretariat, PTA, Members, Secretariat, Members"

"3001",3001,"148","148.    The Committee on Trade and Development Seminar on Trade, Technology and Development, held on 14 February, was opened by the Director-General, Mr Mike Moore. It was addressed by distinguished speakers from the Indian and Zambian delegations in Geneva; from the Brazilian Ministry of Science and Technology; from the National Research Council of Canada; from the Southern Methodist University, Dallas, Texas; and from OECD, UNCTAD, UNIDO, UNEP and the WTO Secretariat. Although the seminar was, regrettably, sparsely attended, all those who took part recognized the high quality of the interventions during the day and the keen interest of the debate, especially in the afternoon session. This report sets out the main points raised in statements and discussions.","WTCOMTDM32.pdf","Committee, Director-General, Mike, Moore, Geneva, Ministry, of, Science, and, Technology, National, Research, Council, of, Canada, Southern, Methodist, University, Dallas, Texas, OECD, UNCTAD, UNIDO, UNEP, WTO, Secretariat"
"3002",3002,"149","149.     It was widely recognised that technology is a key driver in the trade and development process. In the last two decades, the highest growth rates have been recorded in industries, goods and services exhibiting high technology content. The assimilation and absorption of new technologies, especially those intensive in their use of knowledge-based assets, give developing countries the opportunity to catch up with developed country partners, or to ""leapfrog"" stages of development. But, to some extent mirroring overall patterns in developing countries’ trade, there are great disparities in the degree to which developing countries have been able to benefit from the rapid growth in high technology, high value added sectors.","WTCOMTDM32.pdf",""
"3003",3003,"15","15.     The representative of the European Communities had an open mind about the pending requests and was sure the discussion would continue. The EC also supported observer status for the Organisation Internationale de la Francophonie which did a lot of pragmatic, useful work in areas of concern to the CTD. No links should be made to other pending requests for observership.","WTCOMTDM32.pdf","European, Communities, EC, Organisation, Internationale, de, la, Francophonie, CTD"
"3004",3004,"150","150.     Foreign investment - which includes FDI and other procedures such as joint venture or other ""arms-length"" arrangements - often plays a critical role in the transfer of technology and can contribute to upgrading domestic technological capabilities. But FDI flows also vary enormously across developing countries and are highly concentrated in a few recipients. While foreign investors often provide a first impetus for technological advancement, foreign investment may not automatically lead to an upgrading of technological capabilities. Spill-over effects may be limited, in part owing to the interest that foreign investors – especially multinational companies – may have in safeguarding their technological assets from potential competitors. Equally, the process of transfer is typically costly, requiring significant investment by both parties in a process with uncertain outcomes.","WTCOMTDM32.pdf",""
"3005",3005,"151","151.     Upgrading domestic technological capabilities therefore requires governments to create a suitable enabling environment by adopting appropriate policies. Key policy choices for a favourable enabling environment include investment in human capital, with training matched to skills requirements; infrastructure development; establishment of research institutions with close linkages to the private sector and to foreign institutions; and other policies to strengthen the development of the private sector, including competition and regulatory policy, and sound financial and macroeconomic management. It is also important that policy-makers adopt a dynamic perspective, recognising that sources of comparative advantage change over time. For example, while a country may initially benefit from low unit labour costs, dangers exist if production is confined to low level assembly activities that offer little scope to move up the technology ladder. This situation, if not recognised, can lead to increased vulnerability as competitors emerge. It also needs to be recognised that in any industry, the minimal threshold capabilities required simply for survival is likely to rise with time.

"3006",3006,"152","152.     When considering policy responses, a key element to consider is the opportunities and challenges for the development of technological capability presented by the WTO agreements and the relation of these agreements to policy options open to developing countries.         •       Some speakers noted that, while technology transfer is one of the objectives of the                 TRIPS Agreement (see Article 7), it is unclear how far this objective has been met.                 While there is evidence to suggest that foreign direct investment responds positively                 and significantly to strong Intellectual Property regimes, especially in sectors that are                 intensive in the use of knowledge-based assets, it was also argued that such response                 may not necessarily be linked to enhanced transfer of technology. Furthermore,                 while patent provisions provide channels that can facilitate the transfer of technology,                 many developing countries had in practice experienced difficulty in making use of                 these.         •       On subsidies, it was noted that the WTO Agreement on Subsidies and Countervailing                 Measures rules out certain aspects of activist industrial policy, based, for example, on                 selective subsidisation, by making them actionable through countervailing measures.                 However, serious questions were posed regarding the utility and effectiveness of such                 policies in any case. Although the Agreement classifies certain types of spending on                 research and development as non-actionable (see Article 8), some examples were                 given of instances where developing countries have had practical difficulties in                 deriving benefits from these provisions.         •       Regarding trade in services, developing countries were encouraged to use the                 flexibility – to date sparingly used – available to them under the GATS to attach                 conditions to their market access offers that would facilitate access to technology (see                 Article XIX.2). Commitments in respect of commercial presence may facilitate                 access to technology, including in critical infrastructure-related areas such as                 telecommunications. However, as in goods sectors, access to technology was not                 necessarily coextensive with transfer of technology.","WTCOMTDM32.pdf","WTO, WTO"
"3007",3007,"153","153.     The question of capacity development in Least-Developed Countries was given particular attention, and the point was made that their low participation in the world economy was to some extent a reflection of the technology gap they faced relative to their more developed trading partners. Article 66.2 of the TRIPS agreement, which was legally binding on developed country members, had to date been of uncertain benefit. A possible area of action was the development of a concrete list of incentives capable of overcoming special obstacles for technology transfer for LDCs.","WTCOMTDM32.pdf","LDCs"
"3008",3008,"154","154.     In the afternoon, various speakers from donor and international agencies outlined examples of international collaborative arrangements at bilateral and multilateral levels that can facilitate the upgrading of developing country technological capabilities. It was emphasised that it was important to differentiate technical assistance from the transfer of technology. At the same time, such assistance can enhance the possibilities for technology absorption, especially through the creation of local and cross-border networks and partnerships – including public-private partnerships; transfer of best practices; and the development of linkage between research institutions and enterprises. Numerous examples were quoted, and a presentation was given by the National Research Council of Canada drawing on its experience of over 30 years in the field of technology-related assistance. It was also pointed out that technical assistance can also play an important role in supporting policy formulation with a view to creating an appropriate enabling environment for the enhancement of technological capabilities.

"3018",3018,"23","23.      The representative of Gabon said that she wished to remind Members of the background to the creation of the Central African Economic and Monetary Community (CEMAC). The Community had been created on 24 June 1999 in Malabo, Equatorial Guinea during the conference of heads of state. It replaced the former Customs and Economic Union of Central Africa (UDEAC), which had existed since 1964. Since its independence in 1960, the Central African countries of Cameroon, Central African Republic, Congo, Gabon and Chad had decided to organize their economic cooperation within an institution for regional integration. Their Heads of State had signed the Treaty of Brazzaville on 8 December 1964 which created the UDEAC. On 22-23 November 1972, these states had signed two economic cooperation treaties, one among themselves and another with France, thereby agreeing to a common currency, the CFA Franc, which was the means of financial cooperation in Africa. While monetary cooperation had functioned to the satisfaction of participating member states, it had not generated wider economic cooperation. The overall results of more than 30 years of cooperation within the UDEAC unfortunately seemed modest. Most of the participating countries had actually tried to advance their national interests to the detriment of those of the union. The Republic of Equatorial Guinea joined the UDEAC in 1984 and its economic development had since then been more dynamic. Equatorial Guinea, which was a former Spanish colony, had changed currency to become a member of the CFA Franc region and had officially become a bilingual country. Both French and Spanish were currently officially spoken.","WTCOMTDM32.pdf","Gabon, Members, Central, African, Economic, and, Monetary, Community, Malabo, Equatorial, Guinea, Customs, and, Economic, Union, of, Central, Africa, Cameroon, Central, African, Republic, Congo, Gabon, Chad, Brazzaville, France, Africa"
"3019",3019,"24","24.     The achievements of UDEAC, such as the long experience of monetary cooperation was an important inheritance for the Economic and Monetary Union of Central Africa and the charter of the Community reflected this. However, in contrast to the UDEAC, CEMAC had integrated the concept of economic and social development, whereas the UDEAC had basically been focused on economic and customs matters. CEMAC currently comprised six member states: Cameron, Central African Republic, Congo, Gabon, Equatorial Guinea and Chad. Of these six countries, four were least-developed countries and five of the six were Members of the WTO, the exception being Equatorial Guinea. The CEMAC Treaty set the Community the important task of promoting harmonious cooperation of its member states within the framework of economic and monetary union. In both of these domains, the members aimed at going from a situation of cooperation to a union which would further the integration process. The objective of the Central African Economic Union was the convergence of economic and political performances; enhanced competitiveness of economic and financial activities through harmonization of the rules governing their functioning; the promotion                                                                                    WT/COMTD/M/32                                                                                            Page 5 of a business-friendly legal environment; the creation of single markets through free movement of persons, capital, goods and services; and also by coordinating national sectoral policies. The aim of the Central African Monetary Union was to consolidate the means of monetary cooperation which existed since several decades among the member states. The monetary union was based on the following principles: the recognition of a common monetary unit, the CFA Franc, which was the legal tender throughout the territories of the member states and whose issue and management had been confined to a joint autonomous emission institution, the Bank of Central African States (BEAC). The aim of the single monetary and exchange policy was price stability without prejudice to the imperatives linked to the defence of the currency and the general policies elaborated in the Union.","WTCOMTDM32.pdf","UDEAC, Economic, and, Monetary, Union, of, Central, Africa, CEMAC, Cameron, Central, African, Republic, Congo, Gabon, Equatorial, Guinea, Chad, Members, WTO, Central, African, Economic, Union, Central, African, Monetary, Union, Bank, of, Central, African, States, BEAC"
"3020",3020,"25","25.     In addition, the CEMAC Treaty provided for two institutions: the Community Court of Justice and the Community Parliament. A system of multilateral surveillance had also been considered which would verify the conformity of larger orientations of economic policy on the one hand and watch over the coherence of national policies with the common monetary policy on the other. The CEMAC represented a community of over 30 million consumers and whose principal bodies in hierarchical order were: the Conference of Heads of State, which held its first meeting on 24-25 June 1999 in Malabo, the Council of Ministers charged with the economic union, the Ministerial Committee responsible for the monetary union, the Executive Secretariat in charge of general coordination, the Inter-State Committee whose task is to assist the Executive Secretariat in preparing dossiers to be brought up to the Council of Ministers, the Bank of Central African States, the Banking Commission and the specialized bodies of the two unions.","WTCOMTDM32.pdf","Community, Court, of, Justice, Community, Parliament, CEMAC, State, Malabo, Council, of, Ministers, Ministerial, Committee, Executive, Secretariat, Inter-State, Committee, Executive, Secretariat, Council, of, Ministers, Bank, of, Central, African, States, Banking, Commission"
"3021",3021,"26","26.      The Community as it was structured was a complete institution designed to promote and diffuse ideals, acts and other commitments which could facilitate central African integration. In terms of the activities carried out during the year 2000, on 5 October 2000 a protocol of cooperation with the WTO had been signed. That protocol aimed at putting in place a programme of capacity building for the officials from CEMAC member states as well as from the Executive Secretariat to enhance the use of the WTO Agreements. To date, the Common External Tariff , the Generalized Preferential Tariff, the Value Added Tax and enterprise/company taxes had been harmonized. In addition, the community investment charter which had been adopted by the Council of Ministers in December 1999, constituted a first-choice instrument for promoting investment in the CEMAC area. The dissemination and the implementation of the community recommendation on competition as well the establishment of a regional stock exchange would be envisioned in the immediate future. CEMAC worked in close collaboration with various other institutions such as the European Communities and the ACP group of countries. The distribution of CEMAC bodies in the region was as follows: the Executive Secretariat of CEMAC was located at Bangui, Central African Republic; the Court of Justice was located at N'djamena, Chad; the Parliament would be located to Malabo, Equatorial Guinea on establishment; and the Banking Commission would be located at Libreville, Gabon.","WTCOMTDM32.pdf","WTO, CEMAC, Executive, Secretariat, WTO, Council, of, Ministers, CEMAC, European, Communities, ACP, Executive, Secretariat, of, CEMAC, Bangui, Central, African, Republic, Court, of, Justice, N'djamena, Chad, Parliament, Malabo, Equatorial, Guinea, Banking, Commission, Libreville, Gabon"

To have a value added of 20 per cent did not make a contribution to an economy. The profit of value-added in the production sometimes was 20 per cent. The proposal would therefore not help the countries. Even when products were brought from one country to the other to be repackaged, the 20 per cent criteria could be met. With a 40 per cent limit, more value-added was possible.

"3036",3036,"4","4.       The Chairman of the Sub-Committee on Least-Developed Countries said that, pursuant to the decision taken at the 23rd Session of the SCLDC on 12 February 2001, the proposal on an Integrated Framework Pilot Scheme, together with the recommendations contained in the proposal, had been adopted. He highlighted the four elements of the proposal for the pilot scheme. First, the pilot scheme would initiate the work on mainstreaming a trade integration chapter into country development and poverty reduction strategies. The IF would be the mechanism to assist the trade integration process within the policy framework of the World Bank Poverty Reduction Strategy papers. This was one of the key elements highlighted in the 6 July decision of Heads of IF Core Agencies. The pilot scheme would focus first on those LDCs which had demonstrated a clear choice and commitment to mainstream trade. Once positive results were achieved, consideration would be given, no later than at the WTO 4th Ministerial Conference, to extend the initiative to other LDCs. Second, the pilot scheme had established an IF Trust Fund which was indispensable for the purposes of implementation. The establishment of the IF Trust Fund was also consistent with one of the key objectives of the core agencies, namely, to transform the IF from an unfounded into a funded mandate. Third, the pilot scheme would elaborate a coordinated, sequenced and prioritised programme of technical assistance within the PRS policy framework. This programme of trade- related technical assistance and trade-related capacity building would include infrastructural needs, to WT/COMTD/M/32 Page 2 be considered at either World Bank consultative groups or United Nations on Development Programme round tables. The decision made clear that the trust fund would fund technical assistance exceptionally. Finally, the pilot scheme would establish an IF Steering Committee and at the same time strengthen the existing inter-agency working group. The steering committee would comprise all stakeholders. Members were keen to ensure that the composition of the IF steering committee would improve coordination, ownership, responsibility and involvement of all stakeholders. The decision would provide support to the six core agencies, particularly with regard to the joint statement issued on 6 July 2000. This decision on the IF Pilot Scheme represented the first concrete step in implementing the joint statement. More importantly, the IF had now been placed on a footing where all parties, donors, LDCs, agencies and others had shared responsibilities. After a long period in which no progress had been made on the IF, the Chairman expressed his own sense of relief that negotiations amongst donors, LDCs and agencies had made this decision possible, which he believed would deliver benefits to the most vulnerable Members. Although there was more work to be done on the implementation of the pilot scheme, he hoped that others would share the satisfaction felt by himself and other members of the SCLDC on its adoption. He was confident that this was a major step forward, including in a WTO confidence building in the preparation for the 4th Ministerial Meeting of the WTO.","WTCOMTDM32.pdf","Chairman, World, Bank, Poverty, Reduction, Strategy, IF, Core, Agencies, WTO, IF, Trust, Fund, World, Bank, United, Nations, on, Development, Programme, IF, Steering, Committee, Members, LDCs, Chairman, LDCs, Members, WTO, WTO"

Those 40 per cent could previously be cumulated across all LDCs and Canada. What had been changed, was that LDCs also could use inputs from other developing countries. If an LDC used an input from a developing country, the Government of Canada allowed that LDC to include that in the content of the 40 per cent up to half, i.e. up to 20 per cent. The idea was to allow LDCs which were sourcing from other developing countries, a greater opportunity to take advantage of access into the Canadian market. He stressed that the change did not mean reducing the level but opening up the ability for LDCs to do some sourcing from developing countries.","WTCOMTDM32.pdf","Canada, Canada, LDCs, Canada, LDC"

"3042",3042,"45","45.      The representative of Norway said that, since its establishment in 1971, the Norwegian GSP scheme had been enlarged a number of times. Changes had been made both to the list of products entitled to preferential tariff treatment, the list of beneficiary countries and the rules of origin. The objective of the revisions had been to make the Norwegian market more accessible to exports from developing countries and especially the LDCs. Norway's latest notification distributed in document WT/COMTD/N/6/Add.2 showed the consolidated and revised version of the Norwegian GSP scheme and contained an overview of the countries covered by the scheme, the different products entitled to WT/COMTD/M/32 Page 8 preferential tariff treatment and the provisions of rules of origin. For instance, since 1995 all GSP imports of products originating in LDCs were entitled to duty- and quota-free access with the exception of flour, grain and feeding stuffs. In 1998, the Norwegian government had implemented a revised regulation on rules of origin, harmonized with the rules applied by the European Communities and Switzerland. That amendment also opened for bilateral cumulation of origin products originating in Norway. The regulation provided for future diagonal cumulation of origin with products originating in the European Communities and Switzerland on a reciprocal basis. The three parties had recently signed an agreement to that end which would be implemented in the spring of 2001. The consolidated version of the GSP scheme had recently been sent to all Norwegian embassies. The Embassies had been instructed to approach the authorities in a number of beneficiary countries where the GSP scheme is not yet operational. The aim was to inform them about the scheme in order to ensure that preferential tariff treatment would effectively be granted. His government hoped that the initiative would increase the actual utility of the scheme.","WTCOMTDM32.pdf","Norway, GSP, Norway, GSP, LDCs, Switzerland, Norway, Switzerland, GSP"

He therefore thanked all involved, especially UNCTAD which had provided both a panellist and a chairman. That type of cooperation between WTO and UNCTAD was important and should continue in other areas. He supported the Chairman's report, on the understanding that the report was without prejudice to what other Members who had attended the seminar had to say. He said that in the view of his delegation, the seminar had been successful. He said that the ability to create new technologies and to acquire and successfully adapt technologies from both external and internal sources were critical determinants of a country's ability to compete successfully. Technology was not confined to product and process technology, but included organisational knowledge. Access to technology was not easy and there were obstacles. There was a place for policies at all levels for promoting transfer of technology, and the WTO Agreement had to be part of those policies. The TRIPS Agreement, in particular, dealt with technology issues and had important implications on transfer of technology to developing countries. He particularly shared the Chairman's regret for the sparsely attended seminar and he hoped that attendance would be better in the future.","WTCOMTDM32.pdf","Zambia, chairman, WTO, UNCTAD, Chairman, Members, WTO, Chairman"
"3055",3055,"57","57.      The representative of Egypt said that his delegation wished to thank the delegation of Zambia for taking the initiative to call for a seminar on the issue of technology, trade and development. The level of participation in the seminar by delegations from both developed and developing countries had been disappointing. However, that had not prevented lively and informative discussions, particularly during the second half of the seminar when the structure of the session allowed for interaction between the floor and the panelists. He welcomed the report of the Chairman on the deliberations of the seminar and wished to share with the Committee some of the points and conclusions his delegations had noted during the three sessions. First, technology remained the most important vehicle for development. It was a crucial factor, today more than ever, in determining the competitiveness of developing countries in an increasingly globalized world. Second, transnational corporations had no general interest in the transfer of technology. Hence, openness to foreign direct investment would not guarantee by itself such a transfer. Rather, it would allow Transnational Corporations (TNCs) acquire locational assets and establish international production networks. Reference had been made during the seminar to recent studies that had found that FDI had a weak technology spillover effect, and in some cases a negative one as it affected the ability of local firms to build their capacity to compete. Third, there was a significant difference between transfer of technology and diffusion of technology. The former took place between TNCs and their affiliates and involved purchase of equipment, while the latter involved transfer of knowledge and know-how and was more likely to occur between foreign affiliates and local firms. Those linkages between local suppliers and TNCs affiliates constituted the main channel for the diffusion of know-how as well as the human factor represented by employment. Fourth, developing countries should not seek the mere use of technology and its applications. Rather, ownership of technology held the key for those countries to apply it in order to develop products, manufacture others and ultimately develop new technologies. Fifth, as the study presented by the OECD revealed, although the share of high-tech exports of east Asian countries in the total exports increased, a number of characteristics such as over- dependence on imported components, inputs, imported equipments and foreign research and development rendered them vulnerable, as had been demonstrated by the crises these countries endured in 1997. Sixth, governments' policies were crucial in ensuring that developing countries WT/COMTD/M/32 Page 10 technological capabilities were developed. That was not a fast process, but rather one that would yield results on the medium term. It required a number of factors to be put in place. Governments should have the flexibility to apply policies that ensured that the appropriate investments were attracted to the market. That would be primarily in the areas where domestic enterprises and research and development efforts would benefit from the existence of and linkages with foreign investment. Governments needed to maintain their policy options to adopt such an approach. There was a need to set incentives for foreign direct investment to contribute to the development of domestic human capital. Those should not take the form of competition among developing countries, not even between developing and developed countries. In that regard, it had been mentioned during the seminar that the bargaining power of developing countries in relation to TNCs was diminishing, especially as most of the markets were currently open to foreign direct investment. To overcome that there was a need for an internationally orchestrated effort. Some ideas had been mentioned during the seminar and they had to be followed up. The WTO Agreements clearly dealt with transfer of technology issues in the same way as they dealt with the special and differential treatment provisions, namely, through best-endeavour clauses. Even in the one article where there was a clear commitment, Article 66.2 of the TRIPS Agreement, developing countries were still waiting for its full implementation. Finally, the transfer of technology was a cross-cutting issue in WTO Agreements, which had to be treated horizontally. One of the ways to do so, as mentioned in the seminar, was to consider a working group to examine what bearing do WTO Agreements had on technology policy options for developing countries.","WTCOMTDM32.pdf","Egypt, Zambia, Chairman, Committee, Transnational, Corporations, FDI, OECD, WTO, WTO, WTO"
"3056",3056,"58","58.      The representative of Switzerland said that, as had been highlighted by the informative presentations, technology was a core component to upgrade and develop an economy. The panellists had managed to explain well the issues surrounding technology and technology transfer and how complex it was to successfully integrate a new technology into the existing structures of an economy. It was rather unlikely that simply handing over a new technology or attracting foreign direct investment in the high-tech field guaranteed a sustained and improved performance for a whole economy. As it had been shown, the absorption capacity of an economy was critical and as well as the existing level of technology education policies, and so on. It had been good to hear concrete examples in from organisations such as UNIDO and UNEP, concerning efforts ongoing in the international community to support technology transfers as well as efforts on a bilateral basis, for instance also by his government which had, as an example, a programme of setting up so-called cleaner production centres in various countries like Brazil, Morocco, Vietnam and India. It was important that delegates in Geneva were aware of such efforts which took place in the context of trade-related technical assistance even though they might not always be directly linked to a particular article in a WTO Agreement. Delegates also needed to be aware that there were other fora which treated the question of technology. The participation at the seminar of WTO Members had to be deplored as it had been rather unsatisfactory. While there was no doubt that it was, in theory, useful to organize such a seminar, it would seem necessary to reflect whether there was really a demand for such types of activities in Geneva. There were time constraints for the delegates and it might be necessary to consider reducing the number of seminars and other events despite their potential usefulness, not least in order not to waste the scare resources of the WTO Secretariat.","WTCOMTDM32.pdf","Switzerland, UNIDO, UNEP, Brazil, Morocco, Vietnam, India, Geneva, WTO, WTO, Members, Geneva, WTO, Secretariat"
"3057",3057,"59","59.      The representative of Uruguay said that his delegation thanked the Zambian delegation for having taken the initiative to the technology seminar. The seminar had given delegations an opportunity to review the various multilateral norms, and discuss the transfer of technology and its consequences for developing countries and for the least-developed countries. He underscored the low level of participation from both developed as well as developing countries. The seminar had also given the opportunity to learn about the important work being done by other international organizations such as UNCTAD and UNIDO among others. His delegation was concerned over the fact that the multilateral standards and norms which had to do with transfer of technology within the WTO Agreements were a dead letter. They had not been implemented and what was worse, nothing seemed to be done about it. The fact that the multilateral norms of technology transfer had ceased to                                                                                    WT/COMTD/M/32                                                                                           Page 11 be binding had to be a source of institutional concern to the WTO whose norms and standards within the multilateral trading system were supposed to be binding. His said that his delegation wished to stress, as had also been made manifest during the seminar, that transfer of technology was fundamental to any development policy aimed at inserting developing countries into international trade. There were clear concerns that provisions for technology transfer had not been observed at the multilateral level while there existed initiatives at the bilateral and regional levels which made technology transfer possible. He emphasised that technical assistance should not be confused with technology transfer. That concern had been reflected in paragraph 7 of the draft report of the seminar. The report reflected the suggestions and comments made by delegations participating at the seminar. However, it would be appropriate if, in paragraph 5 on the multilateral norms of technology transfer in the WTO Agreements on TRIPS, Subsidies and Services, the Articles dealing with technology transfer could be specified as they had been mentioned by the Secretariat itself when the item had been introduced.","WTCOMTDM32.pdf","Uruguay, UNCTAD, UNIDO, WTO, WTO, WTO, Secretariat"

The discussions during the seminar had been important and rich despite the low attendance. The report provided by the Chairman accurately reflected the items covered during the discussions. However, the report might have been enriched by a few examples of the types of technology transfer initiatives which were ongoing. She said that her delegation was grateful for having had the opportunity to bring in a senior speaker from the National Research Council of Canada who had made specific comments and had provided extensive details about technology transfer programmes in which Canada had been involved in partnership with developing and LDC countries in the past 30 years. Although the discussions had brought out some of the weaknesses of the multilateral system in terms of actually delivering on technology transfer, it had also pointed to a number of interesting ongoing initiatives.","WTCOMTDM32.pdf","Canada, Zambia, Chairman, National, Research, Council, of, Canada, Canada"
"3060",3060,"61","61.      The representative of Trinidad and Tobago said that she wished to thank the delegation of Zambia for having initiated the seminar. The speakers at the seminar had been good and her delegation regretted the low level of participation which did nevertheless not hamper the quality and the richness of the exchange and debate. The seminar had highlighted the importance of technology as a key element of the trade and development process. The point had been brought out with the fact that technical assistance and the transfer of technology were not synonyms and that one could not be a substitute for each other. It was also clear that the WTO Agreements did contain provisions for transfer of technology, but these seemed to be honoured more in the breach than the observance. The seminar had focused too much on the South-East Asian countries. Her delegation had therefore been pleased to hear the interventions by the National Research Council of Canada and by the representative of the Brazilian Ministry of Science and Technology. She suggested that if similar seminars were held in the future, an attempt should be made to broaden their reach to take into account examples involving the broader WTO Membership. She concluded by saying that the Chairman's draft report seemed to be a good one, and added that her delegation supported the call for a working group on transfer of technology in the WTO.","WTCOMTDM32.pdf","Trinidad, and, Tobago, Zambia, WTO, South-East, Asian, National, Research, Council, of, Canada, Ministry, of, Science, and, Technology, WTO, Chairman, WTO"
"3061",3061,"62","62.      The representative of the European Communities said that his delegation thanked the Chairman for the report which seemed to be accurate from what had been said by representatives of other delegations. Regarding attendance he said that his delegation had been among those who had had a real problem of scheduling on the day of the seminar. That was the reason why his delegation had only been briefly represented. The solution might not be to have fewer seminars but to try to make ends meet by looking closely at the dates chosen and at the conflicting requirements imposed on delegations. He said that this did not excuse non-attendance of the seminar but added that a member of his delegation also had a medical problem which prevented him from attending the seminar. He said the Chairman's report made a number of important points which his delegation was pleased to see reflected. The first part dealing with appropriate policies to encourage foreign direct investment and accompanying technology transfer made the right points. His delegation was pleased that the key WT/COMTD/M/32 Page 12 policy choices mentioned did not refer to the question of whether a country should choose mandatory requirements on trade-related investment measures, as that particular discussion seemed to belong to a bygone era. Referring to point five of the report, where mention was made of certain specific WTO Agreements, he said there was space for a further discussion on those issues in the WTO, whether in the TRIPS Council, the Committee on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures, or in the GATS context. His delegation would be happy to follow up the discussion in all three fora. The intention of the seminar had precisely been to give new impetus and a broader vision of the development angle of the discussions in the various bodies which dealt more concretely with those issues.","WTCOMTDM32.pdf","European, Communities, Chairman, Chairman, WTO, WTO, Committee, GATS"
"3062",3062,"63","63.      The representative of Cuba said that the seminar had been good, although only few delegations had been present. The dates of seminars had to be carefully chosen to increase the number of participants. Many officials had said that developing countries should have better technology as the difference between a developing and a developed country was large in that respect and the gap was increasing daily. If a true contribution to development was to be made, the problem should be looked at carefully and solutions should be sought, holding conferences on technology and looking at the transfer of technology even from the trade point of view. He noted that references had been made to the transfer of technology on commercial terms. However, when firms made investments, they were often not ready to transfer technology. There were sometimes governmental obstacles which meant that some countries were unable to benefit from technology available on the market, and this was harmful to development at the world-wide level. For that reason, his delegation agreed that with the statement made by the representative of Uruguay to the effect that the WTO provisions concerning transfer of technology remained a dead letter. There was a need to change the situation and to make a contribution to the dissemination of technology. His government agreed with the statement made by the representative of Trinidad and Tobago that a working group of transfer of technology was needed. This question had been raised at Seattle and was still of relevance. The possibility of establishing such a working group needed to be examined.","WTCOMTDM32.pdf","Cuba, Uruguay, WTO, Trinidad, and, Tobago, Seattle"

The panellists had elaborated on areas of concern to developing countries, especially with respect to strengthening developing countries capacities in the global market. He wished to stress certain issues reiterated during the seminar. His delegation agreed that transfer of technology was an urgent and important element in order to increase the capacity of developing countries to compete in the global market. Developing countries wished to see concrete implementation of transfer of technology as soon as possible. One panellist had said that globalisation presented developing countries with more challenges than opportunities. The seminar had brought out the fact that developing countries should see more opportunities to enhance the transfer of technology in order to increase their capacity. He said that the seminar's discussions on government policies for investment and technical assistance had been interesting. His delegation hoped that the WTO and other organizations dealing with technical cooperation could provide more assistance in strengthening the capacities of developing countries to produce more competitive products for the global market.","WTCOMTDM32.pdf","Indonesia, WTO, Members, WTO"
"3064",3064,"65","65.      The representative of the United States said that her delegation had attended many of the sessions of the seminar. She highlighted that emphasised that the chief responsibility of her delegation was to attend the WTO meetings, whether informal or formal. When there was a clash between a need to attend a meeting and a seminar, the seminar would get secondary consideration. However, her delegation had attended the seminar and had found it enlightening, in particular when she heard colleagues speak and advance certain interesting positions. The seminar had helped her delegation to better understand positions that were presented in the deliberative meetings of the WTO. She said paragraph five of the report could be clearer, so as to bring out that it reflected suggestions offered by certain speakers, rather than a general consensus at the seminar or from the panel. While it was mentioned in the first tiret in paragraph five stated that ""some speakers noted"", that type of articulation had been lost in the subsequent tirets. The text therefore sounded too conclusive towards                                                                                    WT/COMTD/M/32                                                                                           Page 13 the end of the report.

The representative of Kenya said that the representative of the European Communities and a number of other delegations had referred to the problem of the schedule of meetings. He remarked that if the delegation of the European Communities had a problem, then smaller missions like his would need divine intervention to cope. He said there had been a large number of meetings on that particular day, including a meeting at UNCTAD on a similar topic. However, he did understand the predicaments facing the WTO Secretariat in scheduling meetings, but, as there were seminars on the CTD work-programme for the current year, he asked the Secretariat to schedule them in a way which maximized participation, especially of developing country delegations.","WTCOMTDM32.pdf","Kenya, UNCTAD, WTO, Secretariat, Secretariat"
"3066",3066,"67","67.      The representative of the Philippines said that he had attempted to put a few minutes aside to attend the seminar. He shared the same observations as those made by the representatives of Egypt and Paraguay. The documentation on the South-East Asian experience had not consisted of analytical or motivational studies but trends-analysis which tended to static and experiential. They were therefore of limited value in guiding LDCs and other developing countries as to what their objectives should be in order to benefit from access and transfer of technology, nor did they indicate how WTO norms could assist those countries. What mattered with respect to technology was not think-tanks but large transnational corporations. The value of the seminar would therefore have been enhanced if analytical work had been presented on motivation and marketing strategies for transnational corporations to share their technological know-how with developing countries. The seminar was fortunately only a beginning and his delegation did encourage another seminar of this kind as there was a sincere interest in the issues of technology transfer and access to technology. both of which could be realised through the commercial transactions of transnational corporations, hopefully with support from the WTO TRIPS and Services Agreements.","WTCOMTDM32.pdf","Philippines, Egypt, Paraguay, LDCs, WTO, WTO"

Informal consultations would have to be carried out in order to determine if there was any further work that might be carried out, seminars to be held or how the Committee might wish move forward on the issue. He had suggested nothing more than that incoming chairman might wish to hold consultations. If delegations could not agree to any further work, he presumed that no further work would be carried out. However, if delegations were in a position to agree on follow-up, it would be possible to continue work on the issue.","WTCOMTDM32.pdf","Chairman, Committee, chairman"

The Chairman recalled that, at its meeting on 17 July, the General Council decided that the contact point for an input to the UN High-Level Event on Financing for Development planned to take place in March 2002, was to be the Committee on Trade and Development (CTD).

As Members were aware, the manner in which the UN had structured the preparatory process for the High-Level Event had been to establish six working groups: Domestic Financial Resources; FDI and other private flows; International Trade; International Financial Cooperation through, inter alia, ODA; External Debt; and Systemic Issues; enhancing coherence and consistency of the international monetary, financial and trading systems in support of development. A report by the UN Secretary-General had been prepared for the Preparatory Committee which was holding a second meeting in New York. A briefing on this work was given to the CTD at its previous meeting in November 2000 by Mr. Tulloch and Mr. Eglin, the Directors of the two Divisions most closely concerned.","WTCOMTDM32.pdf","Members, UN, Domestic, Financial, Resources, International, Trade, International, Financial, Cooperation, ODA, UN, Preparatory, Committee, New, York, CTD, Tulloch, Eglin"

At the previous meeting of the CTD in November, Members agreed to revert at this meeting to the question as to how to make a useful input by WTO Members into the preparatory process. For this purpose Members had held two informal meetings of the CTD on 19 January and 9 February 2001 for which Members had an informal paper by the Secretariat to stimulate the discussions. At the informal meeting of 9 February, Members asked the Secretariat to prepare a short statement which could constitute the WTO Members' political input into the event. This draft was distributed to Members on Wednesday, 14 February and was available in the room.","WTCOMTDM32.pdf","CTD, Members, WTO, Members, Members, CTD, Members, Secretariat, Members, Secretariat, WTO, Members, Members"

To move the process forward, he proposed that Members move into informal mode to consider the draft. If at all feasible, a redraft could be made available later in the day for further consideration. Members also had to decide whether or not Members wished to forward the Secretariat paper to the Preparatory Committee, perhaps attached to the political input. This was only touched on by a few delegations at the previous meeting, so it would be of use if other delegations could also give their views on this question.","WTCOMTDM32.pdf","CTD, Chairman, Members, Members, Members, Members, Secretariat, Preparatory, Committee"

The Chairman recalled that an earlier draft of document WT/COMTD/W/78 had been discussed at an informal meeting on 17 October 2000 and subsequently at the previous sessions of the CTD in informal mode. The Secretariat had revised the draft in the light of comments made and the document entitled ""A Strategy for Technical Assistance in WTO"" was now before Members for their consideration. He called on Mr. Léger, Director, Technical Cooperation Division to introduce the document. He added that Mr. Mercier, Director, Training Division and Mr. Osakwe, Head of the Secretariat Working Group on Least-Developed Countries and the Integrated Framework, were present at the meeting to answer questions.","WTCOMTDM32.pdf","Chairman, CTD, Secretariat, WTO, Members, Léger, Director, Technical, Cooperation, Division, Mercier, Director, Training, Division, Osakwe, Head, Secretariat, Working, Group, on, Least-Developed, Countries"
"3082",3082,"81","81.      The Director of the Technical Cooperation Division, Mr. Jean-Maurice Léger, said that he wished to identify only the major changes in the document. These were the result of written and oral comments on the earlier version. Regarding the first section, what had previously been under the three separate headings of ""Definitions"", ""Principles"" and ""Objectives"" had been consolidated and simplified under the heading of ""Definitions and Objectives"". Sub-section B on ""Setting Priorities"" under Section III on ""Implementation Modalities"" had been revised to concentrate on priorities per se. References to high and low priorities had been deleted, meaning that what has been left out were not priorities. The Sub-section on ""Organizing Technical Assistance Activities"" had been revised to state more clearly that the demand-driven approach began with national needs and that the regional focus or sub-regional perspective resulted from national needs and not vice-versa. Another major change related to the order of the sections. The entire Sub-section on ""Organizing Technical Assistance Activities"" had been moved before the Sub-section on ""Modes and Instruments of Delivery"" to show a more logical sequence of steps undertaken. In addition, the issue of ""Internal Coordination"" in WTO of technical assistance had been added to the Sub-section on ""Organizing Technical Assistance Activities"" as a number of delegations had raised that issue. The Sub-section D on ""Modes and Instruments of Delivery"" had been reduced substantially and the details previously in the chapter had been moved to Annex 2. A fifth change related to the title of Sub-section E which had been renamed ""Cooperation with Other Institutions (including bilateral donors)"" to include a reference to bilateral donors. That resulted from the fact that a document and a CD-Rom on ""Sources of trade- related technical assistance"" had been made available to Members last year. That information had been collected following a letter from the Director-General Mike Moore to all international organizations as well as to Members and other institutions providing technical assistance. Section V on ""Financing Technical Assistance"" had been revised in view of the comments received to focus on the need for an adequate regular budget supplemented by volontary contributions and financing from multilateral institutions rather than identifying a short-fall in the regular budget which was the situation currently experienced. Another request by delegations had been to introduce references to the Integrated Framework, JITAP and the three-month trade-policy course offered by the Training Division which had all been incorporated. Finally, a new Annex 3 had been added which listed WTO's comparative advantage in the area of technical assistance.","WTCOMTDM32.pdf","Director, Technical, Cooperation, Division, Jean-Maurice, Léger, WTO, Members, Director-General, Mike, Moore, Members, WTO"
"3083",3083,"82","82.     The representative of the United States said that her delegation supported the notion that the WTO should devise a technical assistance strategy. However, she said that her delegation was of the view that it should be concentrated on ensuring that the current technical assistance was being delivered effectively. The paper covered many aspects of implementation modalities and monitoring of technical assistance reasonably well. There seemed to be lower attention paid to donor countries who provided assistance compared to the emphasis on bringing technical cooperation into the regular budget. She said that her delegation did not support that. As had been evident in last falls Budget Committee discussions, some increases for the WTO technical assistance had been approved. However, it had been clear that there was no consensus to bring bilateral technical assistance expenditures on budget. Her delegation could not agree with the proposition in the paper on that WT/COMTD/M/32 Page 16 matter. There were other examples, such as in the U.N. system, where bilateral donations were handled in an effective way to ensure that technical assistance was delivered effectively.","WTCOMTDM32.pdf","United, States, WTO, Budget, Committee, WTO, U.N."
"3084",3084,"83","83.     The representative of Switzerland said that the changes had substantially improved the document. In-depth, reflection had been added and there was no doubt that the strategy could be put into practice. She said that her delegation wished to mention the efforts made to include the necessary coordination between the WTO and other international organizations and also among the different divisions within the WTO Secretariat. Her delegation particularly welcomed the fact that the document covered activities of several divisions of the WTO Secretariat. Technical assistance was often considered a right of developing countries. Her government was convinced that technical assistance was necessary, but irrespective of the effort made, it would serve no purpose without the involvement of the beneficiary countries. They were responsible for evaluating their needs and the impact of any assistance depended on the developing countries themselves. Her delegation therefore encouraged the Secretariat to promote an interactive process as suggested in paragraph 9.","WTCOMTDM32.pdf","Switzerland, WTO, WTO, Secretariat, WTO, Secretariat, Secretariat"
"3085",3085,"84","84.      She continued by saying that her delegation also was pleased with the efforts of the Secretariat to set priorities in order to establish a realistic and practical program. Her delegation supported the priorities among the beneficiary countries suggested by the Secretariat. However, she had two remarks in that respect. The first concerned the Training Division. Her delegation wondered if it would not be possible for it to tailor its priorities to the technical assistance needs identified. Even if short-term technical assistance was always available to LDCs, African countries and other targeted countries, it could not substitute for the three-month trade policy courses. Paragraph 21 which stated that all beneficiaries would have access to training at least once during a two-year period, should be considered in a flexible manner in order to give special attention to the LDCs, African countries, non-resident Members and small economies. That would constitute a coherent approach with established priorities in light of the needs identified. That would also make it possible to strengthen links of solidarity in favour of the least favoured countries. However, that should be done without reducing the access to the three-months trade policy courses for other beneficiaries. In the longer run, the solution was therefore to substantially increase the capacity of the WTO Secretariat to carry out training. Despite the tribulations of the Budget Committee which had taken place last year, her delegation remained convinced that the WTO training capacity had to be doubled. Given the lack of resources, priorities had to be defined in terms of the services that the WTO technical assistance could provide. If technical assistance was necessary for NGOs, civil society, the private sector, negotiators or for the training of trainers they all demanded different types of services. Priorities therefore had to be established. The primary role of the WTO Secretariat was to address government officials in the beneficiary countries. Another issue which was not the direct subject of the strategy, but which could have direct implications for the practical implementation of technical assistance was the division of tasks and responsibilities within the Secretariat. Four divisions or separate units were currently providing technical assistance or were directly involved with the questions of trade and development: the Development Division, Technical Cooperation Division, Training Division and the Secretariat Working Group on the Integrated Framework and LDC Issues. These entities were currently placed under the supervision of three different members of the higher level WTO administration. That was a situation which did not favour the application of a coherent technical assistance strategy, in particular when it came to choosing among competing projects according to the priorities defined in the strategy document. Such decisions should be made by one and the same person provided with the adequate power, for example at the level of a deputy director-general. This person should not only be the head of those four sections of the Secretariat mentioned but should also have the power to take all relevant decisions with respect to the administration of the technical assistance strategy.","WTCOMTDM32.pdf","Secretariat, Secretariat, LDCs, Members, WTO, Secretariat, Budget, Committee, WTO, WTO, WTO, Secretariat, Secretariat, Technical, Cooperation, Division, Training, Division, Secretariat, Working, Group, Integrated, Framework, WTO, Secretariat"
"3086",3086,"85","85.     The representative of Canada said that her delegation had noted that points taken on board in the revised version of the technical cooperation strategy included the demand-driven approach, the setting of priorities, the relationship with other processes including the Integrated Framework, the                                                                                     WT/COMTD/M/32                                                                                            Page 17 development of multi-year plans, inclusiveness, the private sector, civil society and training institutions and her delegation was grateful for that. However, rather than always providing on-sight training, distance education should receive the appropriate attention. Her delegation seconded the comments made by the representative of Switzerland regarding the coherent administration within the WTO Secretariat of the various aspects of technical assistance and training.","WTCOMTDM32.pdf","Canada, Integrated, Framework, Switzerland, WTO, Secretariat"
"3087",3087,"86","86.      The representative of Norway said that his delegation was among those Members which had underlined the need to have a clear strategy in place for WTO's technical cooperation activities. The strategy paper prepared by the Secretariat was based on several years of experience. The services of the WTO Secretariat had been in great demand and appreciated. However, the resources of the Secretariat had been limited and subject to ad hoc financing. He said that his delegation was in general agreement with most of the points included in the proposed strategy and he appreciated that the Committee on Trade and Development had an opportunity to discuss it. He said that, in the view of his delegation, WTO's technical assistance activities should be funded through the regular budget instead of having to rely heavily on voluntary contributions as was the current situation. Predictable and stable financing was a prerequisite for good planning and thus for the quality of the granted assistance. His delegation would continue its efforts to reach consensus on the proposal to secure financing through the regular budget. In light of the limited financial and human resources available for WTO's technical assistance activities, setting priorities and drawing up a list of beneficiary countries was necessary. His delegation agreed that the different categories of countries mentioned in paragraph 6 should be eligible for assistance. However, his delegation wished to see a clearer priority being given to LDCs in paragraph 20. Paragraph 27 stated that ""any new Agreement being concluded in the WTO should be accompanied by a framework to be put in place to support its implementation"". His delegation agreed that the implementation of new Agreements would be facilitated if associated technical assistance requirements of individual countries were identified. However, whether that should be done through inclusion of technical assistance requirements in the regular WTO budget, specific references in individual agreements, the drawing up of a list of required assistance in relation to each agreement or a combination of those approaches was a question that should be left to Members to agree upon in upcoming negotiations. It was essential to foster WTO's collaboration with other organizations.      A coherent approach had to be ensured, areas of competence and complementarity identified, joint projects defined and executed and duplication avoided. He called on the Secretariat to explain paragraph 39 where it was stated that the WTO should have as objective to become more focussed on specialized activities for which it had a comparative advantage over other organizations. In light of the limited financial resources available, his delegation expected that the technical assistance activities of the WTO were already clearly focussed on its particular sphere of competence. He asked how the limited resources could be put to an even better use. He said that his delegation supported the comments and proposals made concerning the need for better internal coherence within the WTO Secretariat.","WTCOMTDM32.pdf","Norway, Members, WTO, Secretariat, WTO, Secretariat, Secretariat, Committee, on, Trade, and, Development, WTO, WTO, WTO, WTO, Members, WTO, Secretariat, WTO, WTO, WTO, Secretariat"
"3088",3088,"87","87.     The representative of Australia said that her delegation appreciated efforts to bring improved management and planning into the WTO's technical assistance activities. The emphasis on improved consultations both between line divisions and the Technical Cooperation Division, and also between the WTO and other multilateral and bilateral donors was welcomed. Section V on ""Financing Technical Assistance"" continued the call to have an adequate regular budget allocated to WTO technical cooperation activities. Whilst her delegation agreed that, today, lack of a sufficiently sizeable and stable funding base had detracted from the ability of the WTO to schedule and deliver technical assistance most effectively, her delegation noted that some additional resources were agreed to during the budget deliberations last year and she hoped to see the Secretariat demonstrate the positive impact of that increase prior to more funds being allocated.","WTCOMTDM32.pdf","Australia, WTO, Technical, Cooperation, Division, WTO, WTO, WTO, Secretariat"
"3089",3089,"88","88.     The representative of Zambia said that his delegation sought clarification as to the place of the special needs of the LDCs in the strategy and how it envisaged to address those. WT/COMTD/M/32 Page 18","WTCOMTDM32.pdf","Zambia, LDCs"
"3090",3090,"89","89.      The representative of Philippines said that WTO technical assistance activities were carried out with limited funds. There were complex demands on WTO technical assistance, not only from a bifurcation of the developing countries into less-developed countries, small economies, poor and heavily indebted countries, but also from the point of view of the development objectives, which never should be forgotten in the Committee on Trade and Development and the WTO. As far as the definition of objectives was concerned, it was not only dealing with the competencies in the WTO but also with the fuller integration of countries in the multilateral trading system, looking at broader developmental requirements, capacity building and complementary support to the needs identified by the recipients, in the context of their economic situation. That framework was a challenge to any technical assistance strategy. However, his delegation did not see a problem with the setting of priorities, nor with the definition of national needs. It was also useful to consider the needs in terms of groups of countries or economies, regions or sub-regions as well as in terms of thematic approaches like e-commerce or information and communication technologies. The expectations of developing countries were being raised without any prospect of increases in the budgetary allocations, being internal or external, to technical cooperation activities. The technical assistance strategy should be one of networking and outsourcing, which for those who were in the business of technical assistance and in other agencies in Geneva, had been quite successful in spreading the benefits of technical assistance. That was especially true in the area of market opportunities when based on the context and the economic situation in different parts of the world. The experts in Geneva might not have full knowledge about local situations in other parts of the world. Whatever the amount of needs analysis, it could never replace physical presence and observation of the dynamics of development, growth and trade in a particular region. He said that his delegation therefore was concerned by some assumptions in the section on outsourcing, particularly paragraph 63 which, among other things, stated that it was the responsibility of WTO Secretariat to educate beneficiaries on WTO Agreements. While he was well aware of the fact that WTO experts in Geneva were most knowledgeable about the legal and prescriptive provisions of any agreement, he questioned what those experts knew about the development implications and the difficulties that those Agreements imposed on some of the WTO Members. Sub-item (ii) of paragraph 63 stated that ""part of the bigger picture in WTO technical cooperation is to establish a relationship with its Members; extensive sub-contracting would rob the organization of such an opportunity"". He asked how the WTO Secretariat which already had the expertise could be robbed of it by extensive sub-contracting when the WTO Secretariat had training programmes which the Secretariat controlled. Sub-item (iii) of paragraph 63 stated that in certain areas, such as agriculture and services, where there were on-going negotiations, outsourcing might be more difficult to organize on any significant scale because of the lack of outside expertise. One of the principal reasons for outsourcing was to allow enhanced expertise to be developed outside the WTO Secretariat, in order to multiply the understanding of the WTO. Furthermore, sub-item (iii) of paragraph 63 also stated that country officials often wished to be advised on their commitments and obligations by WTO professionals who were directly involved in the on-going negotiations and who knew how national policy objectives and constraints could be accommodated in country schedules. He said that in his view that was too presumptuous. He regretted not having been able to participate in the consultations on that issue as it was an issue of interest to him. Paragraphs 62 and 63 were unfair, to the point of being unnecessary.","WTCOMTDM32.pdf","Philippines, WTO, WTO, Committee, on, Trade, and, Development, WTO, WTO, Geneva, Geneva, WTO, Secretariat, WTO, WTO, Geneva, WTO, Members, WTO, Members, WTO, Secretariat, WTO, Secretariat, Secretariat, WTO, Secretariat, WTO, WTO"

"3092",3092,"90","90.      The representative of the European Communities said that his delegation liked the paper as it stood and only had a few minor comments. The main question was what the Committee on Trade and Development intended to do with the paper. An endorsement by the Committee was a minimalist option while his delegation suggested that the issue was important enough to be brought to the attention of the General Council, preferably in May 2001 in order for the General Council to confirm the orientation given in the paper in its various components including the activities undertaken in the Committees and in the Integrated Framework. Technical assistance was an important component of the confidence building efforts. The strategy paper could provide a basis for future work in that respect. His delegation also endorsed comments made by other delegations in terms of the internal coordination of the Secretariat.

"3093",3093,"91","91.      The representative of Turkey said that his delegation found the strategy useful for the future organization of the technical assistance activities of the WTO. He said that his delegation's concern related to the priorities set out in the strategy. His delegations supported giving high priority to the integration of the LDCs into the multilateral trading system. The plan seemed to address the requirements of LDCs, African countries, small economies and economies in transition. However, developing countries which were not in those categories needed technical assistance as well. The right of other developing countries to receive technical assistance also had to be taken into account. In addition, an assessment of the outcome of the technical assistance activities in receiving countries would be appropriate. That assessment should include the particular benefits gained by those countries with respect to their participation in the multilateral trading system. Such an approach would not only increase their level of participation in international trade but also entail a better planning of WTO technical assistance activities. He said that his delegation believed that the existing level of cooperation between regional organizations should be sustained and further improved if there was a need. The infrastructure of those organizations might be complementary to the existing expertise of the WTO Secretariat. Since countries of the same region faced similar difficulties and had similar problems, cooperation with regional organizations would be helpful in focussing on those issues of particular regional concern.","WTCOMTDM32.pdf","Turkey, WTO, LDCs, WTO, WTO, Secretariat"
"3094",3094,"92","92.      The representative of Mexico said that the strategy paper should be weighed in the light of all that had been discussed over the last two years with respect to the regular budget, consistency and coherence. It was an urgent exercise. As had been mentioned by the representative of the European Communities, the General Council had to give it direction. If comments were still made, the Secretariat could respond to some of them. Other comments could be made in relation to certain parts of the strategy document and they should first be taken up with the Member making the comment in order for the strategy to be adopted at another meeting of the Committee on Trade and Development. It was a unique document. No other organization had a strategy for technical assistance programmes and activities. In the interest of confidence building and the work ahead, the Committee on Trade and Development should be in a position to adopt the document.","WTCOMTDM32.pdf","Mexico, European, Communities, General, Council, Secretariat, Member, Committee, on, Trade, and, Development, Committee, on, Trade, and, Development"
"3095",3095,"93","93.      Mr. Léger, Director, Technical Cooperation Division said that a number of delegations had indicated that the internal coherence in the WTO was not transparent as staff working on issues related to development worked under different Deputy-Directors General, that the issue of technical assistance was divided in four different divisions and that a Technical Cooperation Audit recently had been created with responsibility for the evaluation of technical assistance. He said that he undertook to relate delegations' preoccupations to the Director-General as the Director-General had the final word on how to organize the WTO Secretariat. In response to the comment made by the representative of Norway regarding the last sentence of paragraph 39, he said that there had been a shift over the last five years in the type of requests the WTO Secretariat received from developing countries, LDCs and economies in transition. When the WTO Secretariat was established in 1995 there had been a demand for general seminars as people then wished to learn what the WTO was all about. They had requested general descriptions of each of the Agreements, and information about Members' benefits and rights. As Members had had to implement the Agreements with fixed deadlines, Members had become more interested in in-depth seminars on specific Agreements. That was also the reason why there had been a shift within the WTO Secretariat from the Technical Cooperation Division undertaking close to 70 per cent of all technical missions at one time to the current situation where only about one third of all technical cooperation missions were being carried out by the Technical Cooperation Division and about two-thirds of the missions by other WTO divisions. The beneficiaries of technical cooperation activities requested WTO specialists to come to their countries to speak about agriculture, rules or intellectual property for example. By concentrating activities in the areas of the WTO Secretariat's comparative advantage, listed in Annex 3 of the Strategy, the WTO Secretariat was using its resources more efficiently than before. An example of that was outsourcing. It was a fact that the WTO Secretariat had signed memoranda of understanding with a number of regional organizations. ESCAP, for example, had organized a three- WT/COMTD/M/32 Page 20 week trade-policy course last year. That meant that ESCAP not only had made the physical arrangements but had also been responsible for identifying participants and making travel arrangements. In the course of 2001, the process had been taken yet a step further as ESCAP would be responsible for lecturing on macroeconomics and the general functioning of the WTO during the first two days of the two-week trade-policy course. However, there was a limit to what the WTO Secretariat could expect representatives of ESCAP to do on specific Agreements of the WTO.","WTCOMTDM32.pdf","Léger, Director, Technical, Cooperation, Division, WTO, Director-General, Director-General, WTO, Secretariat, Norway, WTO, Secretariat, WTO, Secretariat, WTO, Members, Members, Members, WTO, Secretariat, Technical, Cooperation, Division, Technical, Cooperation, Division, WTO, WTO, WTO, Secretariat, WTO, Secretariat, WTO, Secretariat, ESCAP, ESCAP, ESCAP, WTO, WTO, Secretariat, ESCAP, WTO"
"3096",3096,"94","94.      He continued by referring to the issue of financing mentioned by the representative of Australia who had sought information regarding what the WTO Secretariat was going to do with the budgetary increase it had received. At the last informal meeting of the Committee on Trade and Development the WTO Secretariat had received the mandate, in principle, to implement the objectives set out in the strategy. That was what the Secretariat had been doing. He intended to come back to the Committee on Trade and Development in May 2001 with a detailed programme of technical assistance based on requests received and also based on the fact that many of the voluntary contributions received were earmarked. The earmarking might not coincide exactly with the requests received. That was therefore an additional difficulty faced by the WTO Secretariat. The representative of Zambia had asked what the Secretariat did for the LDCs. The current procedure was that when the Technical Cooperation Division or the Secretariat Working Group on Least-Developed Countries and the Integrated Framework received a voluntary contribution that was ear-marked for LDCs it meant that the contribution could not be used for other developing countries or economies in transition. The approaches used in the Technical Cooperation Division and in the Secretariat Working Group on Least-Developed Countries and the Integrated Framework were similar as they basically followed the strategy. In May, delegations would be presented with the programme for Asia and the Pacific, Latin America and the Caribbean, the Middle East, Africa and the Central and Eastern European countries based on the demands resulting from the questionnaire mailed to all developing countries and economies in transition in July 2000 and to which 50 per cent had responded. Ad hoc requests would be dealt with as mentioned in the strategy. A positive aspect that comments on the strategy paper were still being received was that the revised strategy to be presented in May 2001 could then be compared with the three-year plan for 2001-2003 based on the proposed strategy. Delegations would thus be able to judge whether the strategy made sense in practice before further action is taken by the Committee.","WTCOMTDM32.pdf","Australia, WTO, Secretariat, Committee, on, Trade, and, Development, the, WTO, Secretariat, Secretariat, Committee, on, Trade, and, Development, WTO, Secretariat, Zambia, Secretariat, Secretariat, Working, Group, on, Least-Developed, Countries, Integrated, Framework, Secretariat, Working, Group, Asia, Pacific, Latin, America, Caribbean, Middle, East, Africa, Central, and, Eastern, Committee"
"3097",3097,"95","95.      He went on to say that paragraph 62 and 63 on outsourcing reflected the fact that the WTO Secretariat was trying to decentralize and outsource part of its technical cooperation activities while remaining the master of the process and especially keeping control of the technical aspects of the Agreements. The Secretariat rarely received refusals, although it happened, when it informed beneficiaries that a consultant would be sent rather than a WTO Secretariat employee. With respect to what had been said by the representative of the United States on the current draft of the strategy he indicated that the word ""in-budget"" had been deleted and replaced by ""an adequate regular budget"". He had thought that that might satisfy the concern raised by the delegation of the United States. At the last meeting of the Committee on Trade and Development the representative of the United States had asked for the two paragraphs on financing be completely removed. The Secretariat thought that it was not realistic to have a strategy on technical assistance without a mention of financing, but had tried to accommodate the concern by referring to an adequate regular budget supplemented by voluntary contributions plus financing from multilateral organizations and to delete the word ""in-budget"".","WTCOMTDM32.pdf","WTO, Secretariat, Secretariat, WTO, Secretariat, United, States, United, States, Committee, on, Trade, and, Development, United, States, Secretariat"
"3098",3098,"96","96.     Mr. Mercier, Director, Training Division said that he would attempt to respond to the remarks made by the representative of Switzerland which had been supported by the representative of Norway, with respect to the priorities in the WTO Secretariat training activities. What had been suggested was to give higher priority to LDCs in the training courses at the same time as maintaining the access for the other countries. Although it was a desirable proposal, it was impossible in practice. If additional fellowships were granted to a larger number of LDCs, it would mean that other developing countries                                                                                     WT/COMTD/M/32                                                                                            Page 21 and economies in transition would receive less than the one fellowship every two years that each of them were currently receiving. The fact that developing countries and economies in transition received so few fellowships had already been considered deplorable by most delegations. It was desirable that, in the future with an expanded capacity, the request could be responded to. However, in the present context, difficulties would be created for other beneficiaries if the LDCs were to receive additional preference. There was already a large representation of LDCs in each trade policy course. That even included LDCs which had not begun the accession process, which were not observers, and which therefore did not even have a WTO status. In that sense the LDCs were already treated favourably. At the moment, there were between 145-150 countries and customs territories which were regularly invited to the courses and only 144 fellowships available in any two-year cycle. Additional fellowships per year had been made available as of the current year because the study-tour in Europe had been taken out of the trade policy course in order to compensate for the lack of additional funds in last year's budget. An important activity of the trade policy course had thus been deleted from the programme in order to create more fellowships within the same budget. He took note of the remarks made and said that although he sympathized with the hope expressed, the Secretariat was not in a position to implement the suggestion on LDCs without hurting other Members in the process. That was why paragraph 21 had been inserted into the strategy paper to balance the priorities set in paragraph 20 as the same priorities as were set for the WTO technical cooperation activities in general could not be applied to the training courses.","WTCOMTDM32.pdf","Mercier, Director, Training, Division, Switzerland, Norway, WTO, Secretariat, LDCs, WTO, LDCs, Europe, Secretariat, Members, WTO"

In paragraph 11 referring to the ""possible"" effects of non-tariff measures on developing countries, Ecuador considered that there were definite trade-restrictive effects. In paragraph 17 Ecuador would like to hold broader consultations to find a balance in what was being stated. This was linked to what was being discussed in other WTO bodies. Retaining the original language would have facilitated adoption of the text. The references to investment and competition policy seemed to draw inferences about the content of future negotiations.

He suggested that paragraph 16, read ""The Marrakesh Agreement was designed to be a major achievement…"" On paragraph 17, he did not see the need to drop the second sentence nor the later reference to the analytical stage.

Re the US proposal on paragraph 16, he commented that while the first part referred to the declining share of the LDCs, this stress on the LDCs was absent form the later part of the paragraph. There was also an implication that LDCs' capacity constraints were really being addressed as if the WTO work was sufficient to correct imbalances. This was not correct and there should again be a stress on LDCs.

He proposed that this should read ""Since 1995 there has been a decline in the share in world trade of the least-developed countries"". That point was worth making. He recognised that some countries felt there was a maldistribution of benefits and suggested some language which preserved that thought. Something pro-active needed to be added at the end to suggest ways in which to start to deal with the issue which had been identified. In paragraph 17, he believed it would be better to state the issue in a positive way that all could agree where there was further work to be done in the WTO to ensure the widest distribution of benefits.","WTCOMTDM33.pdf","United, States, WTO"
"3142",3142,"7","7.       The representative of Cuba felt that the text did not contain the essence of the problems which most affected trade for developing countries; it simply listed the contradictions of the multilateral trading system, qualifying them as ""economic"". From a general standpoint the document listed some of the obstacles faced by developing countries in order to take advantage of the WTO and reiterated in most paragraphs that free trade policies and the system of multilateral trade standards could contribute most to economic growth and poverty alleviation in these countries. It would not be revealing any great secret to state that economic liberalization has left unfulfilled many promises and the results had not been those expected. This was shown in ECLAC Notes, in a special edition of March past, which showed that, while Latin America and the Caribbean had been particularly active in carrying out trade liberalization, the liberalization of financial markets and of capital flows, economic growth, productive transformation, increased productivity and the reduction of inequality had been disappointing. Economic growth had been insufficient and unstable. The report should also be critical of the role that developed countries could and should play in providing technical and financial assistance to developing countries. This would permit the developing countries to devote more resources to social and development programmes. On specific points, she underlined that solutions such as those mentioned in paragraph 6 on the efforts to be made by governments to create internal resources such as increasing self-sufficiency did not take account of the heterogeneity of developing countries and the diversity of problems, above all taking account of the limited access to external resources. Likewise, drawing attention the last sentence of paragraph 4 and the first of paragraph 6, she said there was no automatic relationship between trade liberalization and promoting economic growth to alleviate poverty. Thus, a book published by ECLAC called ""A decade of light and shadows in Latin America in the 1990s"", a study of 91 countries, recognised that during the first part of the decade profound disparities in world incomes were accentuated. The relation between the average income of the top 5 per cent and the bottom 5 per cent changed form 78:1 in 1988 to 114:1 in 1993. The study also stated that the influence of trade on growth decreased, and it added that the large part of the population of Latin America (83.6 per cent) lived in countries where this inequality increased between 1975 and 1995, reaching levels which were the worst in the world. It was also known that during the 1990s, economic liberalization increased in the 1990s in the least-developed countries, but the main trends in the world economy did not justify their expectations. The poorest countries, instead of converging on the growth of their developed partners, had fallen into a vicious circle of stagnation and recession , with the risk of marginalization leading to the unequal distribution of costs and benefits from the processes of globalization and liberalization. It was therefore not correct to affirm as it did in paragraph 7 that the principle of equity contributed to a favourable economic environment for development, given that in this forum there was equity among unequals, implying an injustice which maintained and increased the historical advantage of the developed countries over the least-developed countries. On paragraph 11, the document should not only recognise the concern about barriers faced by developing countries, but also the need to                                                                                      WT/COMTD/M/33                                                                                              Page 3 eliminate protectionist measures and policies as well as technical regulations and standards which under the guise of environmental or social intentions are being used as new barriers to exports of the developing countries. Thus, Cuba suggested that the document should include the dismantling of technical barriers to trade and the elimination of tariff peaks on manufactured exports of interest to the developing countries. The final sentence of the same paragraph recognised the concern of some Members about the possible negative effect of on development of some trade measures. Cuba wished to reiterate its views on the proliferation and real negative effects of unilateral economic measures in trade to pursue political objectives. The document should recognise that unilateral economic measures affect the trade and development of the developing countries, harmed the international economic and political environment and particularly affected the economies and development efforts of developing countries, especially their capacity to mobilize resources in the area of trade to finance development, as well as being incompatible with the rules of international trade. The lack of financial resources for development was one of the principal problems to be resolved through international cooperation and it was therefore necessary to reach an agreement on this. Any international cooperation on development should respect the right of governments to decide on their national development priorities and hence the specific needs for cooperation. The process of globalization of the world economy imposed a financial burden on developing countries which could not be underestimated. Integration in the world economy could not ignore this reality nor accept it with a kind of fatalism. It was necessary to reform the rules of international trade in order to address the inequalities and imbalances which existed so that trade liberalization would provide benefits to all WTO Members and positive efforts should be made so that the developing countries, especially the least-developed, could obtain that share in the growth of international trade that corresponded to their economic development needs, in line with the Marrakesh Agreement. Finally, Cuba wanted to emphasise that the WTO Members' contribution to the Conference on Financing for Development did not constitute a binding commitment and was therefore a rhetorical document that would not lead to concrete initiatives to mobilize financial resources for development.","WTCOMTDM33.pdf","Cuba, WTO, ECLAC, Latin, America, Caribbean, ECLAC, Latin, America, Latin, America, Cuba, Members, Cuba, WTO, Members, Cuba, WTO, Members, Financing, for, Development"
"3143",3143,"8","8.       The representative of the European Commission was not 100 per cent happy with the language because some of the straightforward messages on financing for development had been diluted and that was the inevitable price for a consensus document. On the other hand the EU was quite pleased that some of their suggestions had been taken on board. The EU was ready to adopt the paper as it stood. The new proposals were basically also acceptable, but the EU would like for political reasons to see the word ""all"" deleted from the Argentine proposal, so that the fourth sentence of paragraph 11 would read ""Members consider that…"" Other changes were acceptable. In response to Cuba, the document was balanced: it did not say that liberalization was good and all should carry it out. It did have the right parameters that there were certain other conditions, constraints and issues to take into account. He hoped the paper would be acceptable as a first step and showed that the WTO was able to deliver a message. Fine tuning could be done later. This was not necessarily the final word. It would depend how the process went on. A more in-depth contribution by the WTO might yet be possible on some individual issues. He supported efforts to conclude that day and urged other delegations to take a similar view.","WTCOMTDM33.pdf","European, Commission, EU, EU, EU, Members, Cuba, WTO, WTO"
"3144",3144,"9","9.       The representative of Egypt had been ready to adopt the paper, although it had minor comments. He was surprised by the new comments which made adoption more difficult. On paragraph 11, there was a proposal to delete part of the sentence that some measures were disguised restrictions on access and replace it with ""owing to the possible trade restrictive effects"". Egypt preferred the previous language as a statement of developing countries' views. The previous language only referred to some measures where as the new language said that all the measures had possible trade-restrictive effects. Egypt did not agree with the word ""possible"", because in certain cases it was evident that they did have trade-restrictive effects. So Egypt preferred the original language or to delete the word ""possible"" from the new language. Regarding the US proposed amendments to paragraph 16, there was a reference to efforts that included measures to build capacity in developing countries. These efforts were not necessarily part of the on-going process to address the issues of WT/COMTD/M/33 Page 4 implementation. Egypt had commented to that effect in a previous meeting and this had been resolved in later versions of the paper. He suggested that the final sentence should start ""Efforts are also exerted to build capacity.."" and so on, as suggested by the US. He also noted that the US wanted to suggest how to deal with certain problems, but this was a wider issue and the CTD was not the forum to deal with implementation issues. On paragraph 17, there was an attempt to take away some of the elements that were important for Egypt. It would be acceptable to include the US comments as well as the original language.","WTCOMTDM33.pdf","Egypt, Egypt, Egypt, Egypt, US, Egypt, US, US, CTD, Egypt, US"

"3151",3151,"10","10.     The Chairperson of the JAG said that the JAG had held its 34th Session from 30 April to 4 May 2001. The report was contained in document ITC/AG(XXXIV)/188. The terms of reference of the JAG were to review the activities of the ITC and to formulate recommendations to the Governing Bodies of UNCTAD and the WTO. The Group examined the following matters during its session: ITC's technical cooperation activities in the year 2000, the draft annual report and the report of the consultative committee on the ITC Global Trust Fund. During the opening session, Mr. Rubens Ricupero, the Secretary General of UNCTAD referred to the important work undertaken by ITC on behalf of the least-developed countries. UNCTAD echoed ITC's concerns regarding the unpredictability of resources, and Mr. Ricupero noted that the rhetoric about the central importance of                                                                                    WT/COMTD/M/34                                                                                            Page 3 trade as a tool for development had not been backed by action from donor countries. Mr. Ablassé Ouedraogo, Deputy-Director General of WTO thanked ITC for its valuable contribution to the work of the WTO to establish capacities for integrating developing countries and transitional economies into the multilateral trading system. He also commended ITC's particularly impressive record in the year 2000 in building teamwork, in providing specialized support to other organizations and in joining partnerships to design and implement technical assistance. In his statement to the Group, Mr. Bélisle referred to ITC's achievements in the year 2000 which included the finalization and pilot testing of the e-facilitated trade development strategy and the design of a programme of implementation called the E-trade bridge. The programme was intended to assist small- and medium-size enterprises in bridging the digital divide. In fact, this programme was presented during an informal session of the JAG meeting where representatives had the opportunity to exchange views on the subject. During the review of ITC's technical cooperation activities in 2000, the Group commended ITC on its new annual report which was more analytical than the previous one and provided an excellent basis for discussion of ITC's technical cooperation activities. ITC's central role in trade-related technical cooperation was acknowledged and its pro-activity in trade-related capacity building unanimously endorsed. Likewise, ITC had been congratulated by many on the effective management of its limited resources. A number of donor representatives indicated interest in being more closely associated with ITC's ongoing efforts to identify ways to achieve its technical assistance objectives, and several endorsed a proposal for a comprehensive independent evaluation to ITC. Such an evaluation would be conducted as a forward-looking exercise with a view to determining ITC's larger role in trade-related technical assistance. The recommendation was welcomed by the Secretariat which suggested that further consultations be held to ensure that the exercise had clear and specific terms of reference and that it involved all stakeholders. Another subject raised was the current practice of the JAG which resulted in documentation being submitted in four languages (English, French, Russian and Spanish) while interpretation was in the six official languages. One representative requested documentation in all six languages as was customary in UN meetings, while another representative, insisting on the Joint UN-WTO nature of JAG, was not in favour of increasing administrative costs. This matter would require further consideration. Finally, at the 31st Session, government representatives had either announced or confirmed voluntary contributions to ITC and the Chairperson of the JAG expressed gratitude to the Governments of Canada, China, Denmark, Finland, France, India, the Netherlands, Norway, Sweden and Switzerland for their contributions.","WTCOMTDM34.pdf","Chairperson, JAG, ITC, UNCTAD, WTO, Group, ITC, ITC, Global, Trust, Fund, Rubens, Ricupero, UNCTAD, ITC, UNCTAD, ITC, Ricupero, Ablassé, Ouedraogo, WTO, ITC, WTO, ITC, Group, Bélisle, ITC, ITC, Group, ITC, ITC, ITC, ITC, ITC, ITC, ITC, Secretariat, UN, Joint, UN-WTO, ITC, Chairperson, Canada, China, Denmark, Finland, France, India, Netherlands, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland"

With respect to the services issue, he appreciated that a new version of the document would show the various paragraphs of the negotiating guidelines corresponding to the comments.

"3153",3153,"101","101.     The representative of Uruguay asked the Secretariat again about the difficulties in creating a new category of S&D treatment, which referred specifically to the subject of transfer of technology. In the view of his delegation, having a specific category on transfer of technology would have two advantages. First, there would be a single set of provisions in the WTO on the transfer of technology. Second, if the transfer of technology was a separate category, it would be possible in the S&D document to include those provisions with a column on observations, from which it would be possible to see the degree of implementation of those provisions.","WTCOMTDM34.pdf","Uruguay, Secretariat, WTO"

The Chairman said that S&D was an issue to which the CTD would revert in the future as the question of the application of S&D treatment was an ongoing matter of particular concern to the Committee. He then asked the Director, Development Division to introduce the question of a study of the GSP.","WTCOMTDM34.pdf","Chairman, CTD, Committee, Director, GSP"
"3158",3158,"106","106.     The Director, Development Division recalled that at the previous CTD, in the context of the S&D debate, the representative of the United States and one or two other delegations had asked the Secretariat to include work on GSP schemes in relation to S&D. He said that GSP was a big topic and the Secretariat had work in progress but was not yet in a position to present it to the CTD. It hoped to do so at the October meeting of the CTD. The work would contain a descriptive and a quantitative part. If possible, all GSP schemes would be covered. One problem was that GSP schemes were unilateral; there were up-to-date notifications on some GSP schemes, but not necessarily all. He appealed to Members to make sure that the Secretariat had the most up-to-date information on GSP schemes to permit a good job. In the absence of statistical information, in particular, at the tariff line level, the Secretariat had been trying to use information from the Integrated Data Base. Ms. Jackson, Director, Statistics Division would talk about the issue of statistics relating to GSP.","WTCOMTDM34.pdf","Director, Development, Division, United, States, Secretariat, GSP, GSP, Secretariat, CTD, CTD, Members, Secretariat, GSP, Secretariat, Integrated, Data, Base, Jackson, Director, Statistics, Division, GSP"
"3159",3159,"107","107.     The Director, Statistics Division, said that her Division had been actively supporting the Development Division in its work on GSP schemes since early April. The data elements required were as follows: MFN applied duties and preferential duties at the tariff line level; Import values by partner country at the tariff line level; and for each member implementing preferential schemes, identification of the beneficiaries. The primary source for the information required for this exercise was the WTO Integrated Data Base (IDB), built from the official submissions of WTO Members. The mandatory IDB information requirements included MFN current bound duties, MFN current applied duties, and imports by country of origin, value and quantity – all at the tariff line level. Additional information, including information on preferential duties, was not mandatory, but was submitted by some Members on a voluntary basis. The current reference years of the IDB are 1996-2001 for tariffs and 1996-1999 for imports. If all the data were available, it would have been a relatively straightforward task for the IDB statisticians and programmers to compile the required information using the standard software applications with some modifications. However, some of the information needed for this study was not contained in the IDB. For example, the preferential duties of a number of significant traders, in particular the EC were missing. In addition, the IDB information was not up-to-date for all the Members concerned. In order to overcome data availability problems, the Secretariat was looking into the possibility of complementing IDB information with data from other sources, such as the TPR Division and the UNCTAD ""TRAINS"" database. The United Nations Statistical Division's COMTRADE database could also be used for import information, although it did not go beyond the 6-digit level. However, merging IDB and non-IDB data was not, based on recent experience, the optimum solution, essentially because differences in format created additional processing burdens and were also a potential source of errors. In addition, the tariff level on which the information was reported in other sources could differ from the level at which the data were reported to the IDB. Therefore, in order to use such external data, the Secretariat could be obliged to perform some additional calculations on the files used for the analyses (averages, grouping of trade, etc.). The best solution would therefore be for the Members concerned to supply the missing information. In this respect, the EC had already been requested to investigate the possibility of supplying preferential information to the Secretariat in the context of the current Multilateral Appraisal of the IDB process being undertaken by the Committee on Market Access. The Statistics Division would be available to dialogue with delegations in this respect. Despite the limitations on data availability, the work was proceeding. The software applications needed to WT/COMTD/M/34 Page 18 perform the necessary calculations had been developed using the information of two IDB reporters (Japan and the US), and the results were being extensively verified. After testing, the IDB could then be used to perform similar calculations for Australia, Canada and New Zealand. However, for the EC, the Republic of Korea and Norway, preferential duties would need to be integrated into the working data set using non-IDB sources. These applications could only operate on duties with ad valorem rates or ad valorem equivalents; specific duties could not be used because developing the complex software needed to convert specific duties into ad valorem equivalents was beyond the resources of the Secretariat, and, in any case, not all specific duties could be converted with the existing information in the IDB. Given the current resource constraints, the demanding computer application work necessary, and the sheer volume of information that needed to be analysed and presented properly, a realistic time-frame for presentation of the results to the Committee would not be before its next meeting in October.","WTCOMTDM34.pdf","Director, Statistics, Division, GSP, MFN, WTO, Integrated, Data, Base, WTO, Members, MFN, MFN, Members, IDB, IDB, IDB, EC, IDB, Members, Secretariat, IDB, TPR, UNCTAD, United, Nations, Statistical, Division, COMTRADE, IDB, IDB, Secretariat, Members, EC, Secretariat, IDB, Committee, on, Market, Access, Japan, US, IDB, Australia, Canada, New, Zealand, EC, Republic, of, Korea, Norway, Secretariat, IDB, Committee"

The representative of Sri Lanka, referring to her earlier intervention, proposed the following issues for inclusion into a WTO study of the effects of the GSP schemes on the developing countries: total GSP products coverage for LDCs and non-LDCs; the average tariff level of GSP rates for LDCs and non-LDCs; the total trade under GSP of LDCs and non-LDCs; the impact of the erosion of GSP rates on non-LDCs; the impact of new rules of origin on LDCs and non-LDCs; and, finally, the possible trade effects resulting from unilateral preferential tariff concessions on trade flows from other developing countries. Referring to some of the problems for the study, she recalled an earlier Secretariat paper on how to convert specific duties to ad valorem duties. It would be necessary to take account of tariff quotas because a lot of GSP are preferential tariff quotas. She also noted the importance of non-tariff barriers.","WTCOMTDM34.pdf","Sri, Lanka, WTO, GSP, LDCs, GSP, LDCs, GSP, GSP, Secretariat, GSP"

Not only had the European Communities (EC) made promises, but they had also delivered for the LDCs. The EC had delivered the ""Everything But Arms""-initiative (EBA).

On the other hand, the EC agreed that all concerns had to be adequately addressed, including the possible question of the impact of GSP schemes. He therefore asked the representative of Sri Lanka to put her points on paper. He could already signal that his delegation had a slight problem with the fact that the proposal seemed to be all about the possible impact on other developing countries and not about why GSP was granted in the first place, namely to give preferences to developing countries, which was an accepted part of the WTO system. It was therefore necessary to reflect on how to present anything like that in a balanced fashion. There also seemed to be some technical questions for the Secretariat. There was scope for informal discussions about what was feasible and what was acceptable to the Membership.","WTCOMTDM34.pdf","European, Communities, Sri, Lanka, EC, GSP, Sri, Lanka, GSP, WTO, Secretariat"

The Chairman said that, following the substantial discussion on electronic commerce in the General Council on 8 May 2001, the four subsidiary bodies which also dealt with the issue of electronic commerce had been invited to continue their work and report back to the General Council. The Committee on Trade and Development was one of these subsidiary bodies. He understood that Members attached importance to the issue of electronic commerce and development, and he sought Members views on how to deal with the issue of electronic commerce in the Committee on Trade and Development. An illustrative list of points for which further study was proposed in the CTD had been circulated on 1 November 2000 as an Annex to document WT/COMTD/26. That list contained a large range of issues identified for possible future work in the Committee on Trade and Development. In order for any in-depth work to be carried out in the CTD, it would be necessary to identify specific aspects which Members considered to be of priority importance. Once the Committee had narrowed the list of issues, it would also have to decide on how to deal with them. In addition to the illustrative list, aspects to electronic commerce and development had been mentioned during the General Council meeting of 8 May 2001 when several delegations identified a range of development issues as being horizontal in nature. The issues identified at the General Council included: participation of developing countries in e-commerce; technical assistance; capacity-building; access to infrastructure and technology; promoting the use of information technology; transfer of technology; access to developed countries' markets for developing countries' producers and suppliers; and how to ensure that e-commerce benefits developed and developing countries equally. The Chairman reminded delegations that the 2001 Work Programme for the Committee on Trade and Development already contained a seminar on electronic commerce. The date for this seminar had been set for 14 June, just before the mid-June General Council discussion dedicated to horizontal issues of electronic commerce. The theme of the CTD seminar would be ""Government Facilitation of E-commerce for Development"". Four sessions were envisaged on: Regulation and Deregulation; Promotion of Modern Information and Communication Technologies; Education and Information;                         and Government Coordination/Task-force on Electronic Commerce. The idea was to have a lead speaker from a developing country government for each session, with a respondent from a developed country government and possibly representatives of other international organizations and the private sector. These speakers would share their experiences, and there would be time for discussion.","WTCOMTDM34.pdf","Chairman, General, Council, General, Council, Committee, on, Trade, and, Development, Members, Members, Committee, on, Trade, and, Development, CTD, Committee, on, Trade, and, Development, CTD, Members, Committee, General, Council, General, Council, Chairman, Committee, on, Trade, and, Development, General, Council, CTD, Promotion, of, Modern, Information, and, Communication, Technologies, Electronic, Commerce"
"3169",3169,"116","116.     The representative of Uruguay wished to recall in the CTD the statement that MERCOSUR had made with regard to e-commerce in the General Council of 8 May. MERCOSUR delegations had presented a document (WT/GC/W/434) which stated that MERCOSUR had participated and would continue to participate actively in the WTO Work Programme on Electronic Commerce. The document intended to contribute to the work programme and foster a debate between Members. MERCOSUR delegations hoped to contribute to the development of a methodology, which would enable Members to reinvigorate the work programme, looking both at sectorial issues which were under study in the different subsidiary bodies, and, at horizontal or cross-cutting issues. MERCOSUR delegations had identified three sectorial issues which they wished to highlight in the CTD. The first was the need to perfect human resources in e-commerce; the second was infrastructure; and the third was how businesses could compete in e-commerce in developing countries. There were also three cross-cutting issues: the classification of the content of some electronic transmissions; the relationship between traditional means of trade and e-commerce; and questions related to WT/COMTD/M/34 Page 20 development, including among others technical assistance. The identification of these issues in the MERCOSUR document did not prejudge the conclusion which might come out of an analysis carried out by the Members. Rather, the document aimed at highlighting the close relationship between the different issues. As MERCOSUR delegations had stated in the General Council, special attention should be given to development aspects, as development was a horizontal cross-cutting issue in the work programme.","WTCOMTDM34.pdf","Uruguay, CTD, MERCOSUR, General, Council, MERCOSUR, MERCOSUR, WTO, Work, Programme, Members, MERCOSUR, Members, MERCOSUR, CTD, MERCOSUR, Members, MERCOSUR, General, Council"

The representative of Venezuela said that his country was interested in e-commerce and had carried out a number of activities and programmes in order to bridge the digital divide. One programme created specialized centres for the population to get access to internet services. That programme was called ""Info-Centres"". Venezuela had approved a law on electronic commerce as well as a law on telecommunication which highlighted the importance his government attached to the issue. There was also a draft law on technology. His government considered electronic commerce for development a priority and therefore supported points 7, 9 and 12 of section E of the annex to document W/COMTD/26 which was the illustrative list of points for which further study had been proposed i.e., development of infrastructure, technical assistance in order to bridge the digital divide and technology transfer, perfecting human resources, and how companies in developing countries could compete using electronic commerce. He proposed that the CTD evaluate the impact of e-commerce on development, emphasizing options available to bridge the digital divide. It was necessary to consider technology transfer and giving priority to better access. He reiterated what had been said by the representative of Venezuela in the General Council on behalf of the delegations of Chile, Costa Rica, Columbia, Equator and Peru during the discussion of the work programme on electronic commerce, namely that that group sought continued study of electronic commerce by the different subsidiary bodies. The group hoped to study positive national experiences, the impact on opportunities in investment and the implications for education, public health, development and small and medium-enterprises, etc. and emphasised the importance of the work in the WTO along with other organizations, as well as the need for technical assistance to help developing countries bridge the digital divide.","WTCOMTDM34.pdf","Venezuela, Venezuela, CTD, Venezuela, General, Council, Chile, Costa, Rica, Columbia, Equator, Peru, WTO"
"3171",3171,"118","118.      The representative of the European Communities asked if the chair could make available the list of issues which had been raised in the General Council. Her delegation recognized the usefulness of the paper submitted to the General Council by MERCOSUR listing various issues for examination by the CTD. There was much in common with issues which the delegation of the EC also had raised in the General Council. It was important to learn about the participation of developing country enterprises in electronic commerce. The seminar held the previous year with ITC assistance had given a number of useful examples of different businesses involved in electronic commerce. It could be useful to analyse the elements which had helped them become successful and see how these might be replicated by individual Members or industries at a national level. Information technology was important in that respect, as was the question of how to facilitate the various elements which made up the electronic commerce environment. Her delegation looked forward to the seminar in June, and would be ready to share its own experience in the area, particularly the initiative called ""E-Europe"" which might be of assistance to other Members as well. The issue of technical assistance was obviously important. The EC had been assisting a number of countries and would try to prepare something in written form to the Committee on its efforts. It would also welcome hearing about the experiences developing countries had with technical assistance, in particular what had proved particularly useful or less useful as that could help to guide future assistance. Human resource development was interesting, and could to some extent be carried out through technical assistance or even education, as mentioned by Venezuela. So, there were a variety of issues which could usefully be addressed in the Committee. It could be helpful if Members were to consider submitting even brief papers to help focus the debate on the development aspects of e-commerce.","WTCOMTDM34.pdf","European, Communities, General, Council, General, Council, MERCOSUR, CTD, EC, General, Council, ITC, Members, Members, EC, Committee, Venezuela, Committee, Members"

That effect could be enhanced to the international level with respect to small and medium-size countries and enterprises small and medium size-enterprises within developing countries. The very nature of electronic commerce was increasingly dynamic. Whatever happened to dot.com companies, the situation would stabilize and there would be another stage of electronic commerce which would hopefully be more inclusive. As far as the WTO was concerned, the development dimension concerned more WTO bodies than the CTD. Her delegation thanked MERCOSUR delegations for their contribution, and looked forward to the presentation that would come at the June seminar. Latin America had been moving fast in this area, and the US wished to see what was happening in other regions of the world. Earlier seminars with representatives from Africa and India had shown how electronic commerce worked for them at different levels. The CTD had already identified issues that were specific to the WTO Agreements and her delegation looked forward to more in depth discussion in the CTD. At the same time, some case studies could be identified in the CTD exercise to show how trade could be enhanced at the same time. The government of the United States was working to further capacity building; it had identified ten countries and was planning to augment that pilot scheme to include more countries in all regions, including transition economies. It also had the new initiative which was specific to Africa, and was implementing joint projects with other institutions such as the ITU. Her delegation hoped that the work of other institutions would be reflected at the June seminar, in particular the work of the ITU. Her delegation looked forward to more synergy on e-commerce and development between the WTO and other institutions in Geneva such as WIPO, ITC, ITU and UNCTAD.","WTCOMTDM34.pdf","United, States, U.S., WTO, WTO, CTD, MERCOSUR, Latin, America, US, Africa, India, CTD, WTO, CTD, United, States, Africa, ITU, ITU, WTO, Geneva, WIPO, ITC, ITU, UNCTAD"

He congratulated the ITC for its work, despite problems with resources for technical assistance. The report clearly showed the success of ITC in the year 2000. ITC should also be congratulated for the programme which guaranteed women the opportunity to compete on the international market. He asked whether the annual meetings of the ITC could be held every other year in the United Nations (U.N.) and every other year in WTO, to underline the joint character of the ITC.","WTCOMTDM34.pdf","Mexico, ITC, ITC, ITC, ITC, United, Nations, U.N., WTO, ITC"

The representative of Paraguay said, with reference to the MERCOSUR document (WT/GC/W/434), that the intention of the MERCOSUR delegations had been to contribute to the work in the General Council on horizontal issues as well as the work of the subsidiary bodies, including the CTD. The illustrative list, annexed to document W/COMTD/26 was not exhaustive, but was still useful. Electronic commerce provided opportunities for all regions, even the least-favoured sectors of the planet, and helped the development and trade of those countries as well as the enterprises working in those counties. The work carried out by the ITC could therefore be useful to the discussions in the CTD. He asked if the ITC observer could provide the CTD with more information on the work ITC did with respect to electronic commerce.","WTCOMTDM34.pdf","Paraguay, MERCOSUR, MERCOSUR, General, Council, CTD, ITC, CTD, ITC, CTD, ITC"

The representative of Indonesia said the work of the CTD had contributed positively in helping Members understand the complex issues involved in the dynamic area of electronic commerce. The discussions in the CTD had been particularly important in finding answers to the questions of how e-commerce should be treated in the WTO and in identifying the relevant WTO agreements. Despite the intensive discussion to date in the respective WTO subsidiary bodies, Indonesia considered that further work in the WTO was still required as there were questions that had not been fully answered. More work was needed on the horizontal as well as the sectoral issues. He welcomed the submission by MERCOSUR delegations. His delegation recognized the benefits that e- commerce could offer, such as minimizing transaction costs. However, like many other developing countries, the government of Indonesia also realized that the full use of the potential benefits of e-commerce posed challenges for developing countries, including telecommunications and physical infrastructure. The level of development of each developing country therefore had to be taken into respect when considering the benefits electronic commerce could bring. His delegation supported the proposals on the use of the illustrative list of issues for study, and looked forward to participating in the upcoming seminar.","WTCOMTDM34.pdf","Indonesia, CTD, Members, CTD, WTO, WTO, WTO, Indonesia, WTO, MERCOSUR, Indonesia"

Electronic commerce offered various possibilities for developing countries. However, there was an important gap to fill which required the transfer of technology, the development of human resources, technical assistance and other elements mentioned by the representative of Venezuela.

"3183",3183,"129","129.     The representative of Cuba presented document WT/COMTD/W/87 which supported electronic commerce without restrictions. It was based on an earlier statement on the need for unrestricted global electronic commerce, presented at the General Council on 8 May, when Members agreed to set up a work programme to study all aspects of e-commerce, taking into particular account the needs of the developing countries. In spite of the recognition that progress in international trade must be guided by rules and procedures that were compatible with Article 36 of Part IV on the GATT 1994, several developing countries including Cuba had been prevented from participating in the global project of the ITU, being conducted in cooperation with the Swiss company Wisekey, on electronic commerce for developing countries owing to the United State's policy of imposing unilateral and coercive measures in violation of the rules and principles of international trade. The ITU project was conceived to help developing countries afford access to information technology so as to guarantee secure electronic commerce (digital signatures and encryption techniques). These were in commercial use although export was forbidden for reasons of national security. She said she wished to reiterate the importance of eliminating any kind of restriction on trade for political reasons. Restrictions such as those affecting the purchase and free use of coding techniques which were already available on the market would prevent the economic development of technology in developing countries.

The Chairman said that there were four items: Report on Training – Trade Policy Courses 2000, Note by the Secretariat (WT/COMTD/W/82 and WT/COMTD/W/86); Report on Technical Cooperation Activities in 2000 (WT/COMTD/W/83); Three-Year Plan for Technical Assistance (WT/COMTD/W/84);                and A Strategy for Technical Assistance in WTO (WT/COMTD/W/78/Rev.1). He suggested to begin with the two documents prepared by the Training Division of the WTO Secretariat in relation to the 12-week Trade Policy Courses. The first document, WT/COMTD/W/82, was the annual report on those activities for the year 2000, while the second document, WT/COMTD/W/86, reflected the results of a review that had been undertaken by the Training Division on these Trade Policy Courses (TPC). He noted that the second document was presented under the initiative of the Secretariat to allow Members to have a better understanding of the evolution of this activity as a result of efforts to improve the practicality and effectiveness of this type of training. He invited the Director, Training Division to introduce the documents.","WTCOMTDM34.pdf","Chairman, Secretariat, WTO, WTO, Secretariat, Secretariat, Members, Director"
"3188",3188,"133","133.    The Director, Training Division, said that 82 officials from 72 countries/customs territories had followed the courses in 2000. In 2000, there was an English/Spanish/English sequence of courses. If the ongoing French 17th TPC were included, 78 per cent of the coverage of the cycle 2000-2001 would have been reached. Out of the 153 countries/customs territories invited to the courses, 120 had been covered thus far. There were still 33 countries/customs territories to cover. All LDCs would have participated in at least one TPC by the end of this year. A new cycle would start in January 2002 and extend through 2003, unless changes occurred in the total number of fellowships available, for example, through the implementation of the doubling proposal put forward by the Director-General. He thanked the Canadian, Spanish, Finnish and Swiss authorities equally for the study tours they had hosted in the year 2000, as well as Switzerland for the financing of one consultant on trade negotiations techniques. As mentioned in the report, efforts were continuing to improve the practical aspects and the overall operation of the courses. He was looking forward to possible cooperation with other consultants and other financing sources as well for briefings on aspects of trade negotiations, techniques and training. He mentioned that the study tours abroad had been deleted from the programme as of January 2001, and in this way it would be possible to finance seven additional fellowships in the year. More time was needed to assess the real impact of the absence of study tours abroad since the course was so intensive that the participants needed some kind of a break, even when it is a break related to WTO matters. He said that the WTO had also been talking with some Universities, and it seemed that the programme of the three months was so intensive that it was almost equivalent to 50 per cent of a Masters' degree for which the participants so far did not have any formal recognition as credit for their studies. It might be possible to negotiate something with the universities to provide proper credit to those who participated in the course. He also referred to the proposal on the doubling of capacity of the training activities, as put forward by the Director-General last year, but nothing had been agreed by the Members in terms of additional financial contributions. The Director-General would be proposing this same capacity doubling again this year. Such doubling would require initial one-time expenditures on physical installations (conference rooms, equipment and so on) and perhaps voluntary contributions to facilitate the expansion. He also informed the CTD that the Association of Former Participants of GATT/WTO Trade Policy Courses had been reactivated in February 2001, and about 70 former participants who were in Geneva had been invited. This number had grown to 75, excluding four Secretariat members WT/COMTD/M/34 Page 24 who were also former participants. There would be a meeting of the Association with the Director-General on 18 June. The Association was also looking forward to organizing a gathering of former participants at the beginning of the Doha Conference which would be attended by a large number of ex-participants in the GATT/WTO courses. The WTO was continuing to build up the electronic database of the former participants of the courses, but was still lacking about one-third of the replies from countries which participated in the past. The basic document to which the Chairman referred was being provided for information only in the interests of transparency, not for action by Members. It was for the information of Members about the efforts undertaken to put into practice recommendations arising from former participants in the courses, the WTO's own observations on the organization and delivery of the residential trade policy courses, as well as from WTO Members themselves in this Committee in particular. He noted that the Training Division was now undertaking an ever-more systematic assessment/evaluation of its activities, and was quite encouraged by the results. The Basic Document also established guidelines for the organization and delivery for the WTO's residential Trade Policy Courses, based on the feedback from participants, Members and the Secretariat. The guidelines identified the objectives to be met for the two-year cycle of courses, for individual courses, for modules and for sessions inside the modules. Thirteen objectives had been identified, ranging from the mandate of the Training Division itself, to the coverage of WTO aspects, transfer of knowledge and skills, effective organization, clarity, objectivity, practicability and the inclusion of a ""development dimension"" in the training. The evaluation tools consisted essentially of weekly evaluation questionnaires covering all sessions, plus a final questionnaire for the whole programme, and, finally, an interactive final evaluation session. From 2002, there would be self- evaluation questionnaires for all the topics. This additional tool would allow each participant to see for himself or herself how much had been learned. For the training officials, it would allow them to better focus the review sessions.","WTCOMTDM34.pdf","Director, Training, Division, Director-General, Switzerland, WTO, WTO, Universities, Director-General, Members, Director-General, CTD, Association, of, Former, Participants, of, GATT/WTO, Trade, Policy, Courses, Geneva, Secretariat, Association, Director-General, Association, GATT/WTO, WTO, Chairman, Members, Members, WTO, WTO, Members, Committee, WTO, Members, Secretariat, Training, Division, WTO"

The course delivery was of a very high standard and professional quality. There was an initiative to reformulate some of the objectives of the course and she looked forward to having an even better crafted course for future participants. She endorsed concerns expressed by Mexico, Pakistan and Venezuela about the contraction of aspects of the trade policy course. She was also concerned that the pool of the beneficiary countries for a certain number of fellowships had been extended by merging developing countries and economies in transition, which meant therefore that each of those groups would have perhaps a less frequent turn at the tables. She also thought that the initiative on the Alumni Association was a very positive one, encouraging continuing interaction between past participants.","WTCOMTDM34.pdf","Barbados, WTO, Mexico, Pakistan, Venezuela, Alumni, Association"

He thought it would help former participants in the Trade Policy Courses by circulating the CD-ROM being brought out by the WTO Secretariat from time-to-time. This would be helpful in updating their knowledge. It was also possible to see from the participants the areas of the interests and send them to the e-mail address. Also, in view of limitations in financial resources, it would be useful to pursue the use of distance learning.

The representative of Cuba thanked the Secretariat for the presentation of the report, as well as for the participation Cuba had in the different trade policy courses organized under the GATT and WTO. These courses had been of considerable importance, since they had contributed to the training of young civil servants in a number of trade policy instruments, allowing for better participation in the deliberations in the WTO, as well as making decisions on trade policy at home. She was concerned that the courses did not offer the possibility for more systematic participation of her country. Cuba would like that participation in courses be over a shorter period, allowing for one participant per year. Thus civil servants in capitals would gain experience, and this would have a multiplier effect on domestic decisions as well as allowing for the increased participation of the Cuban delegation in the different deliberations, especially at such an important time as the preparation for a new Ministerial Conference. Consequently, Cuba would like to insist on the need for the participation of one candidate per year in the trade policy courses.","WTCOMTDM34.pdf","Cuba, Secretariat, Cuba, GATT, WTO, WTO, Cuba, Cuba"

Once every two years was insufficient, especially as in addition to diplomatic civil servants from the foreign trade ministry, there were requests from civil servants in other ministries who were involved in WTO affairs, such as the Ministry of Agriculture, Industry and others dealing with WTO topics. As to what was raised by Indonesia on attending courses in Spanish, it was practically impossible for Latin American officials to participate in the courses given in English or, especially in French, which was why there were courses in Spanish. He understood that others could benefit from courses given in Spanish but Latin American officials could not always participate in the French courses, especially if they did not come from the foreign trade ministry.

"3205",3205,"149","149.    The Director, Training Division, said that a number of points had been made about diplomas and the academic recognition of the training. Another question which was mentioned by nearly everyone concerned the study tours and the related question of the additional fellowships. There were also questions on the frequency of courses and the sequence of languages in the delivery of training courses and other references to different more specific subjects. On the question of diplomas and the recognition, he welcomed all the comments, some of which had been very helpful. For the time being, this was at the beginning of the exploration of the idea. It was important to recall that the first objective was not really to provide a graduate training, but to provide for increasing the institutional capacities in the developing countries for integrating in the multilateral trading system and understanding better the multilateral trading system. It was almost by accident that the current size of the course compared with a large part of the curriculum of some universities, not a deliberate choice. The WTO would explore the possibilities for getting academic recognition and how much could be done for those which had taken the course earlier. However, there would be difficulties in the sense                                                                                      WT/COMTD/M/34                                                                                             Page 27 that it was one thing to give lectures and another thing to have them recognized by universities, as mentioned by Venezuela. For example, it might be necessary to introduce new elements in the courses, such as examinations. This had been done once in the early eighties, and it had led to such a negative outcome that he certainly did not want to go in the same direction. But the self-evaluation questionnaires might be acceptable to universities instead of formal examinations, as might the recognition of written research papers. On study tours, he was aware of the benefits: it was one way to interact with the officials of other countries, and, in this case, industrialized countries. Western Europe and Canada had contributed to these activities. However, with the blessing of the Director-General and senior management, the WTO had opted, at least for the time being, for the suppression of the European and Canadian study tours. This allowed for providing seven additional fellowships at about CHF 20,000 each, not a negligible amount. The course was also shorter: it used to be four months and now only three months which meant that it was barely possible to fit all the programme in that time even without the study tour. It was important to note that one study tour for two days study in Switzerland was being retained, plus another break, so that allowed for three tour days all together during the course which was very demanding, intellectually and physically. The programmes also allowed at least one half-day free for the participants each week, so they could do other reading or visit experts in the WTO. So the minimum had been kept in the study tour area. The WTO would consider the need for a longer tour, but if training capacity were doubled it would be difficult to keep asking the same developed-countries' authorities to organize tours for such a large number of groups. If there were six courses a year instead of three, it would mean going to six different capitals and then, the following year starting again. Regarding the sequence of languages, the current sequence corresponded to the demand since the WTO had been in existence. A greater frequency of Spanish courses or French courses would necessarily affect the capacity to meet the demand for the English courses. English, unfortunately or fortunately, was the language of the WTO in the informal sense, and everybody wanted to learn the terminology in English, wanted to be trained in English. All told there were 153 customers to satisfy every two years. Some 162 fellowships were paid from the regular budget including the 14 which come from the suppression of study tours. With more rooms, more budget and more staff, one course per year could be done. He said that he would look into the demand from India for lists of various sources of information. He thanked those who supported the increase and who had expressed their appreciation for the training courses. Delegates would have ample opportunities to repeat their support in the appropriate fora.","WTCOMTDM34.pdf","Director, Training, Division, WTO, Venezuela, Western, Europe, Canada, Director-General, WTO, Switzerland, WTO, WTO, WTO, WTO, India"

He highlighted that at least two developing countries had contributed to the Fund alongside developed countries. His delegation supported those who had expressed a desire to see documents translated into other languages, even if there was a problem with its financing.","WTCOMTDM34.pdf","Haiti, Chairperson, ITC, LDCs, ITC, Director, ITC"

The representative of Pakistan wanted to emphasize the importance of technical assistance and training activities for developing countries and the LDCs, and understood the constraints which the Training Division faced in terms of capacity. The important element in the whole training programme was to ensure that the participants utilised the training available, that they at least left the WTO with some understanding of the WTO agreements, which in three months or twelve weeks was practically impossible. The underlying emphasis should be always on quality and not just increasing the number of participants. In 1998, in a formal meeting of the CTD, Pakistan had suggested that if a team of four or five experts or WTO officials were sent to capitals, they could reach a much greater audience. This suggestion had largely been welcomed by the Membership. The then Chairman, Amb. Chowdhury, had acknowledged that that could be a cost-effective way to overcome the capacity constraints.","WTCOMTDM34.pdf","Pakistan, Training, Division, WTO, WTO, CTD, Pakistan, WTO, Chairman, Amb, Chowdhury"

The documents for the items were: (i) Report on Technical Assistance Activities in 2000 (WT/COMTD/W/83); (ii) the Three-Year Plan for Technical Assistance (WT/COMTD/W/84) – a follow-up to the initial documents covering the years 2001-2003 circulated last October and November under WT/COMTD/W/79 and 79/Rev.1; and (iii) the Strategy for Technical Assistance in WTO, which had already been discussed on several occasions by the CTD. This latest revision incorporated comments made at the previous meeting of the CTD and more importantly, there had been informal discussions with delegations during the last several months to evaluate how well the Strategy as proposed fitted the needs of recipient countries.","WTCOMTDM34.pdf","Chairman, WTO, CTD, CTD"
"3210",3210,"153","153.     The Deputy Director-General responsible for technical assistance (Mr. P.-H. Ravier) introduced the discussion with two preliminary comments. First he introduced Mr. Paul Rolian, who since February 2001 was in charge of the Audit of the Technical Assistance. It was very important to have this auditing of technical cooperation work done properly, both for the beneficiaries as well as the donor countries. Second, the Senior Management of the WTO, and specifically the Director- General was conscious of the remarks emanating from Members about the necessity to put some order in the internal organization of the Secretariat as far as Technical Assistance was concerned. Solutions were currently under consideration by the Director-General, and if and when decisions were to be taken, Members would be duly informed.","WTCOMTDM34.pdf","Director-General, Ravier, Paul, Rolian, WTO, Director, Members, Secretariat, Director-General, Members"
"3211",3211,"154","154.     Turning to the subject of the meeting, he referred to the document on strategy which had been under discussion since the previous October. This had not been worked up and he believed that it would not be finalized. He asked whether it was necessary to search for a shorter document, such as the 1996 version. Instead of searching for a difficult consensus on a long detailed document, he asked whether it would not be better to go for something more flexible, shorter, with more general ideas about objectives, certain ways of handle things, the methods, the management, the human resources as well as financial resources. As concerned the three-year plan, the document reflected the activities which were planned but it did not reflect those which were not planned and which represented a very important part of the activities. Besides, it was well known that the degree of implementation of the three-year plan was low. Was it therefore necessary to continue with the constant up-dating of the document? He sided with the opinion that it was useful and necessary to have as a complement to the strategy document another which could be called a plan for two, three years or x-years which would be more precise on the activities of the organization in the area of technical cooperation. It might therefore be useful to ask whether it was necessary to have an elaborate strategy document with the three-year plan which was also very developed or was it possible, because these two were complementary, to have a document on strategy which would be much shorter, more general and which could be associated to the three-year plan which would still be rather detailed or the contrary. Alternatively, if a relatively developed and elaborate strategy document were desired, then could not the three-year plan be much more simple?","WTCOMTDM34.pdf",""
"3212",3212,"155","155.      Concerning the strategy paper, he had three series of comments in this connection. First, technical assistance was demand-driven. However, financially, it was impossible to satisfy all requests. This meant it was necessary to set up priorities. These priorities had to be set by the beneficiary countries – a principle which must be respected. The way in which priorities were determined on the basis of a common joint agreement was by means of a questionnaire sent to Member countries to ask them to place in order their priorities concerning technical cooperation. So far, the rate of reply to these questionnaires was about 54 per cent and he thought this approach should be continued. It was important for this questionnaire to be completed carefully on the basis of a dialogue between the delegations in Geneva and the administrations in the capitals. Also, it was important for someone in capitals to select the different priorities for technical cooperation, so this questionnaire was a good means, but not the only one to determine these priorities; another approach was in the framework of the Integrated Programme; and also another way could be the use of the trade policy reviews to include consultations on matters concerning technical cooperation with the                                                                                    WT/COMTD/M/34                                                                                           Page 29 country under review. There was a whole series of means to draw up, on the basis of a common agreement, the indispensable priorities for a good management of request for technical cooperation, but nothing would ever replace the permanent dialogue between the requesting countries and the Secretariat. Second was the question of how to balance the management on a geographical basis with a more horizontal approach, based on the WTO agreements. Technical cooperation has moved progressively from general explanations of the multilateral trading system to a much more technical approach on the details of each and every agreements. So there may be some logic in starting the implementation of the technical cooperation activities with the Techncial Cooperation Division and then passing on to other Divisions dealing with one or other agreements.","WTCOMTDM34.pdf","Member, Geneva, Integrated, Programme, Secretariat, WTO, Techncial, Cooperation, Division"
"3213",3213,"156","156.    Third was the question of resources. The first thing to bear in mind was that human resources were just as important, even more so than financial resources. If the WTO had US$20 million to spend on technical cooperation, it would not have the human resources to carry out the work. As concerns financial resources, the relationship between voluntary contributions and the regular budget funds was quite out of proportion, because the budgetary means accorded for less than 20 per cent of voluntary contributions. This was in the hands of the Members, but everybody knew this led to management problems because voluntary contributions were always accompanied by conditions, reducing flexibility and the possibilities for the Secretariat to have flexibility in the management of technical cooperation activities. Since the voluntary contributions were far higher than ordinary budget contributions, there was a problem of increasing conditionality. This is legitimate from the donor's point of view, but made management ever more difficult. Another issue for reflection was the problem of coordination among those making voluntary contributions. He was not suggesting a further Committee but the issue would be present even more in the future.","WTCOMTDM34.pdf","WTO, Members, Secretariat, Committee"
"3214",3214,"157","157.     The representative of Peru referred to the document on strategies for technical assistance in the WTO. The document had been subject to discussions several times in the Committee in its formal and informal meetings and was a valiant effort. He could see that there had been a great effort to seek new modalities to allow for better programming and planning of technical cooperation. However, these modalities represented a considerable reduction of flexibility on the part of the Secretariat to respond to the real needs for technical assistance which could not be included in a strategy, because the truth was that a strategy which was not flexible was not a strategy; whether military, diplomatic or corporate. On financial and budgetary constraints, Peru supported efforts to include technical cooperation in the regular budget but this was a long-term objective to be realistic. Voluntary contributions would be vital if there was to be flexible technical cooperation, but the problem with these resources was that they had certain conditions attached to them, as in the IMF and World Bank loans. Technical cooperation needed to be sufficiently flexible to address new issues such as the highly technical - the new proposals to reduce quotas in agriculture, e-commerce, the categorization of services, or adapting laws on intellectual property. The programming should be sufficiently flexible to deal with the needs and requests that are presenting themselves constantly over the year.","WTCOMTDM34.pdf","Peru, WTO, Committee, Secretariat, Peru, IMF, World, Bank"
"3215",3215,"158","158.     The representative of Uruguay referred to the establishment of priorities in document COMTD/W/77/Rev.1. The strategy document was the result of the two-day meeting on technical assistance held in July 2000 and other internal reports of the organization. Generally, Uruguay did not have a problem at all with the priority attached to LDCs, other African countries, non-residents and small economies since these countries should receive more cooperation. But this type of priority necessarily may exclude the needs of other developing countries. For example, if we read the document relating to activities in 2000, in the annex which refers to Latin American and Caribbean countries, it is impressive to see the number of courses and seminars, workshops which worked out in the region - in other words, demand was great. All developing countries were continuing to make requests to the WTO Secretariat for technical cooperation activities, so, the establishment of priorities by country did not necessarily reflect the current reality. As the Peruvian Ambassador had said, the new negotiations in agriculture and services and electronic commerce required training, especially the Latin America region. He therefore asked how the Secretariat WT/COMTD/M/34 Page 30 established these priorities. At the Secretariat established these priorities. At the reflections on technical assistance, he did not remember there having been a list or establishment of Latin America priorities by country.","WTCOMTDM34.pdf","Uruguay, Uruguay, Caribbean, WTO, Secretariat, Ambassador, Latin, America, Secretariat, Secretariat, Latin, America"
"3216",3216,"159","159.     The representative of Tunisia said it was important to strengthen the dialogue, as stressed by the Deputy Director-General. The three-year plan could not reflect the technical assistance needs of everyone because some could be identified in advance but others resulted from different situations at different times, especially in the framework of the follow-up of commitments on the WTO agreements. He endorsed the suggestion of Mr. Ravier to involve more Committees in identifying priority needs. The extent of voluntary contributions raised problems for the budgeting of planned activities and left less room for nanoeuvre with regard to technical cooperation, even on priority issues, although he paid tribute to the donor countries. However, the need for technical cooperation and for capacity building was growing especially relating to the implementation of their commitments on the WTO agreements, in the preparatory process for the Ministerial Conference and afterwards. He reiterated Tunisia's support for the JITAP programme.","WTCOMTDM34.pdf","Tunisia, Director-General, WTO, Ravier, WTO, Tunisia"
"3217",3217,"16","16.      The representative of United States said that her delegation had appreciated the report of the JAG and would continue to support the activities of the ITC when proposals were presented in the Budget Committee. The current year would hopefully bring progress towards supplementing the resources. She said that at the Geneva side, her delegation would try to get its capital to do even more to assist the ITC because developing countries had benefitted from the very practical technical assistance provided by ITC. Her government wished to encourage the ITC because of its good results in integration developing countries into the multilateral trading system.","WTCOMTDM34.pdf","United, States, ITC, Budget, Committee, Geneva, ITC, ITC, ITC"
"3218",3218,"160","160.     The representative of the European Commission said that this was an important item, not only because the European tax payer was funding most of the technical assistance, but because it was important to get it right in order to have the credibility of the WTO assured. He appreciated the amount of work which had gone into the compilation of the reports, the three-year plan and the Strategy paper. In the six months since the paper had last been discussed, the world certainly had moved on. The idea of mainstreaming trade into overall development strategies was now firmly anchored, not only in the WTO but also in organizations like the World Bank, IMF, etc., and that should be reflected. It followed that there was a greater need for coherence on donors and organizations, which should also be reflected. Lastly, with the experience from Uruguay Round implementation, there was a clear and renewed focus on the individual agreements, as mentioned by the DDG. For the EC, the strategy was the way the priorities were established and resources allocated. The three-year plan should flow from the strategy and not the other way round. To do that, the commitment to mainstreaming had to be fully reflected in the paper. Paragraph 45 of the strategy paper said: ""In this connection, the strategy incorporates a better use of existing donor coordination mechanisms such as the World Bank Consultative Group Meetings and UNDP Round Table Meetings"". On the other hand, this was not reflected in the questionnaire. For example, countries were not asked how the proposed activity fitted with the PRSP. There were also other parts of the paper where the overall mainstreaming idea could be included. He also considered that what was going on in the WTO, in particular the renewed focus on agreements which comes from implementation experience, should also be better reflected. There should also be a clearer commitment, not just about agreements but within the various Divisions on technical assistance. For example, in the three-year plan there is a short section on page 177 on the LDCs integrated framework. This could not just be only an Annex; it had to be a part of the strategy and fully endorsed by the relevant Division. I would be useful start if all the Divisions that delivered technical assistance were represented in meetings such as this. The EC had taken note of the observations made by Mr. Ravier that the Secretariat was working on this, and was certainly interested to see how the internal re-organization reflected the strategy. On a very specific point, there was a reference on page 5 of the three-year plan, a reference to ear-marking and the constraints on flexibility. The EC would try to take that into account. The question was now what to do next. The description here was of work in progress, something to be revised. Hopefully, the paper could be updated taking into account the points made. A revised paper could be shorter, really a policy paper, not setting out too much detail, the EC hoped that this would be possible before the summer. He would also hope that the paper would have the common signature of all WTO Divisions working in this field. Finally, the EC had produced a draft paper on the agreement by agreement approach, which the EC had pursued in the customs valuation Committee and wished to expand to the SPS activity. This document would go forward as a draft decision within the next couple of days.

"3219",3219,"161","161.     The representative of United States said that she was not in a position to accept the strategy paper that day. The Strategy needed to be more precise, more targeted. The US would look at the objectives from the demand-driven approach and the overall needs of the institution to enable developing countries to participate more effectively in the WTO. She appreciated that the three-year plan actually had divided some sections by the type of technical assistance. The US understood the WTO was not a development institution providing supply-side technical assistance, but in some cases there could be on overlap, including joint projects with other organizations such as WIPO, UNCTAD and ITC and, perhaps, ITU. She asked whether the three-year plan was mainly based on predictions from questionnaires or did it include earlier ad hoc requests? In other words, were ad hoc requests make in previous years carried over into the three-year plan? Also, what was the percentage of ad hoc requests and those requests that made in the questionnaires? How was the choice made between these competing requests? What were the priorities between regions for the use of funding? She also wanted to have a clearer idea of the percentage of technical assistance that came from the regular budget and the percentage from extra-budgetary contributions. Did any of the projections include the possibility of requests arising from ongoing negotiations? These could be anticipated, but the WTO might not have had yet specific requests, and certainly a barrage of requests could be expected when the negotiations were closer. She was also concerned about the Deputy-Director General's comments. The US was doing its best to limit the amount of conditions attached to its voluntary contributions. The US had announced recently that it would be contributing a US$1 million to the WTO Global Trust Fund, and was in the process of dealing with the mechanics for that. The intention is to do the least amount of ear-marking in that context, although it would of course have to take into account countries with which it had diplomatic relations. In the previous year, US$655,000 had been destined for the Africa region, but for the US$1 million that had recently been announced, it was hoped to limit the amount of ear-marking.","WTCOMTDM34.pdf","United, States, US, WTO, US, WTO, WIPO, UNCTAD, ITC, ITU, WTO, US, US, WTO, Global, Trust, Fund, Africa"
"3220",3220,"162","162.    The representative of Switzerland said that it was necessary to improve the long-term effectiveness of technical assistance and to do so, there was a need for a coherent and comprehensive package of technical assistance in the WTO. Even if there is any agreement based approach, it will be necessary to set priorities, as demands would likely be behind what was on offer. It was necessary to reflect on how synergy could be produced between missions to the same country on different agreements. To reach the objectives, there was a need to proceed on two tracks: on the one hand, the WTO needed to develop and define a package, taking into consideration its limited means, both financially and in terms of human resources. That was why the discussion on technical assistance strategy belonged in CTD. On the other hand, beneficiary countries would need to analyze their needs in the medium-term perspective. There should be an interactive process between supply and demand, perhaps through the three-year plan. It may not be the only tool nor even the optimal one, but it was not for the delegates to tell which type of tools should be used. However, he insisted that the more general objective of the strategy include a longer-term prospective on technical assistance. Synergies must be sought, there must be follow-up activities, and the beneficiary countries must have concrete ideas in which areas and by which means they wanted to improve that capacities. The strategy should be an interactive process oriented to a longer prospective and against ad hocism. As long as these lines are followed, Switzerland was not opposed to the Secretariat changing or shortening and improving the strategy.","WTCOMTDM34.pdf","Switzerland, WTO, WTO, Switzerland, Secretariat"
"3221",3221,"163","163.    The representative of Norway welcomed the emphasis on training and the emphasis on coordination/collaboration; all this could be further strengthened. Norway was ready to consider a reform of the strategy, maybe focussing on the agreements. In order to use the strategy, there was also a need for coherence within the organization, and he understood that this was being worked on. He looked forward to seeing how the strategy could be further developed, and looked forward to hearing more about this before the summer break. The three-year plan document was very big, so it was important that there be at least a short summary. There seemed to be some lack of coherence, with a different format for the section of LDCs. This should be worked on to have one coherent document. Lastly, on resources, the WTO needed to have credible TA on budget and Norway was WT/COMTD/M/34 Page 32 ready to work with others to find ways to ensure stable and predictable resource base for technical assistance.","WTCOMTDM34.pdf","Norway, Norway, WTO, Norway"
"3222",3222,"164","164.      The representative of Venezuela said he wished to respond to the questions raised by the Secretariat. In his view, the document on strategy was clear, it was not voluminous and it should be left like this. As to the three-year plan, it should be more specific. It should be shorter or have a good summary as suggested by previous delegations. The documents should be related because the plan should flow from the strategy. Referring to tables 2, 3 and 4, it could be seen that technical cooperation for Latin America and the Caribbean has been reduced drastically. Technical assistance should be demand-driven, and it was the beneficiaries which determined their need. The questionnaires were useful but must be found to new ways establishing disparities. For example, contacts with the focal points in the countries themselves could be strengthened. He agreed that some importance should be attached to geographical distribution as a way of establishing priorities. The priorities raised in paragraph 20 should be linked to paragraph 57 in the strategy paper. The content of paragraph 21 should have an additional sub-section. He was pleased with the discussion in paragraph 4 on the attention to the needs of developing countries. As to the organization of activities, he agreed with idea that there should be a sub-regional perspective when the needs and difficulties were similar. Joint training activities could have a positive effect in the medium and long-term. The proposal in paragraph 32 of the strategy document was positive. Evaluation should be given priority because it would improve assistance in the future. He proposed the creation of a permanent coordination mechanism to guarantee the follow-up and evaluation of the impact in the short-term as well as ensuring continuity and the achievement of the objectives of the technical assistance programme in the medium and long-term. Finally, as to the financing of technical assistance, he hoped that regular budget would be increased, and he expressed his concern that there are continued to be conditions attached to extra-budgetary contributions.","WTCOMTDM34.pdf","Venezuela, Secretariat, Latin, America, Caribbean"
"3223",3223,"165","165.     The representative of Guatemala said that the strategy should be a factual, specific document, but it should also be flexible. It was impossible to summarize in 40 pages the entire strategy for technical assistance in WTO for the next few years. As concerned the establishment of priorities, as Uruguay had said, Guatemala was also concerned about who was to decide the priorities. Members stated the priorities on training matters. The triennial plan was useful, but maybe it should only be for one or two years, instead of three years as now. The type of had hoc assistance, according to new subjects came up on the agenda would be even after the next Ministerial. New subjects might arise, and developing countries would need extra training. This had not been included in the three-year plan. He supported the US point that ad hoc assistance should be specific and not general. Technical assistance for each country within the TPR process should not be optional but obligatory, having long-term benefits for trade policy formulation. Assistance should be given agreement by agreement, there was no longer any need for general seminars but specific workshops tailored to needs. He again stressed the need for flexibility – for strategy and the three-year plan.","WTCOMTDM34.pdf","Guatemala, WTO, Uruguay, Guatemala, Members, US"
"3224",3224,"166","166.     The representative of India thanked the DDG for his presentation of the three exhaustive documents prepared by the Secretariat. It was useful to prepare the three-year plan on technical assistance on the basis of the replies to questionnaires. However, after a lapse of time, some flexibility was important. He agreed with other delegations that technical assistance should be determined by the beneficiaries themselves. Keeping in view the excessive demand for the 12 week Trade Policy Courses conducted by the WTO, some importance could usefully be given to the short-term courses organized outside Geneva. He noted on page 31 of the Secretariat document on technical assistance activities, that the first WTO ESCAP trade policy course and WTO and multilateral trading system for Asian developing economies had been held in Bangkok from 8 to 26 May 2000. In the three-year plan, its duration had been curtailed in 2001, 2002 and 2003. He asked why the duration of this course had been halved. This TPC outside Geneva should supplement the main WTO trade policy course, and, hence, it would be useful if the duration was not curtailed. He also asked about the modalities for nominations to this course, in particular, whether the                                                                                      WT/COMTD/M/34                                                                                             Page 33 nominations were handled by ESCAP Secretariat. Before closing, he wanted to join other delegations with the request that each developing country and economy in transition, held one place per year in the 12 week residential trade policy course. This could not be replaced by regional seminars on trade policy, other trade policy courses and workshops, bearing in mind the intensity of the trade residential courses and the benefits available to the participants by way of access to the WTO Library and other connected international intergovernmental organizations in Geneva. He hoped that a favourable solution could be found to the Director-General's proposal on doubling the capacity of the residential courses. He also hoped that the problem of adequate budget resources could be sorted out soon. He agreed with Venezuela and others that should be continuous evaluation of the technical assistance activities by the CTD.","WTCOMTDM34.pdf","India, Secretariat, WTO, Geneva, Secretariat, WTO, ESCAP, WTO, Bangkok, Geneva, WTO, ESCAP, Secretariat, WTO, Library, Geneva, Director-General, Venezuela, CTD"

The representative of Cuba supported Uruguay, Peru, Guatemala and others on the need for flexibility in the application of the plan to be responsive to the needs of the Member countries. Techncial assistance should be demand-driven, since the Member countries know, best know their own needs in order to be able to participate ever more fully in the multilateral trading system. Cuba was in favour of the participation of all the Divisions of the secretariat in technical assistance. Cuba was very concerned at the conditions for granting technical assistance, as in other fields, and rejected any kind of discrimination towards Member countries in WTO because non-discrimination was a key principle of the WTO. One of the principles of WTO was to grant technical assistance to all countries, in particular to the least-developed countries, in order to help them all fulfill their obligations and attain their rights.","WTCOMTDM34.pdf","Cuba, Uruguay, Peru, Guatemala, Member, Member, Cuba, Cuba, Member, WTO, WTO, WTO"
"3227",3227,"169","169.     The representative of Barbados noted her country's concern with how the plan had been drawn up, i.e., almost uniquely on the basis of the responses to the questionnaire. Needless to say, some countries had not been able to respond to the questionnaire, due to limited capacity and resources. She would not do way with the questionnaire since it was useful, but a mix of measures was needed to arrive at an agreed plan. Secondly, with regard to sources of funding, Barbados had always been very concerned with the extent of voluntary funds, and was quite glad to hear the U.S. and the EC specifically say that they would try to diminish the ear-marking of their contribution. Clearly, what needs to happen is that regular fund contribution should be increased, and should not be subject to conditionalities. Rather it should respond to priorities established in an objective way. On the question of priorities, there was a general principle that all beneficiary countries had access resources but it was clear that priorities must be set in order to achieve maximum results from available resources. Her delegation fully supported the different sets of priorities identified by the Secretariat in the strategy document. Some good work had gone into this document, while the plan would need to be reviewed. She was not so sure that it was necessary to shorten any of the document: details were important in the exercise. Barbados would like to be involved in any consultations that might be held on the issue.","WTCOMTDM34.pdf","Barbados, Barbados, U.S., EC, Secretariat, Barbados"

"3229",3229,"170","170.     The representative of Malaysia said that basically, for Malaysia, what was important was that any strategy on technical assistance should ensure that the needs of Members were met, and this could linked to improving the capacity of members in the WTO, particularly in the implementation of the WTO agreements. In this respect, the strategy paper, whether it be shorter or longer-term should address priorities, based on Members needs, which could be determined either with the questionnaire or through consultations with Members. Second, there was a need to address issues related to resources. Third, regarding the delivery of technical assistance, this could be done by focussing on agreements, but some macro aspects of technical assistance could be covered in the trade policy courses which were cross-cutting in nature. Finally, there was a need to address coherence among institutions delivering the technical assistance so it is to avoid duplication. He also supported the need for flexibility in the three-year plan.

The observer from the Arab Maghreb Union thanked the Deputy Director-General for the very exhaustive and pertinent statement on technical assistance and also the Division on Technical Cooperation for all the documents presented during the course of the meeting. For the Arab Maghreb Union, technical assistance was of great importance for planned programmes including agro-industrial programmes. The WTO should have a long-term strategy, but it was necessary for this strategy to be sufficiently flexible to incorporate the various elements which might arise.","WTCOMTDM34.pdf","Arab, Maghreb, Union, Director-General, Arab, Maghreb, Union, WTO"
"3231",3231,"172","172.     The Deputy Director-General (Mr. Ravier) noted that one of the points which was taken up most often was the matter of flexibility. He was convinced that there was no good strategy without flexibility. Nor was there a good strategy without organization. In consequence, it was necessary to find proper means to balance those two constraints. The equilibrium between the planned activities and the ad hoc activities, reflecting flexibility, was not satisfactory because it depended on first-come, first-served: when there was money a request was accepted, otherwise the WTO had to say no. This was neither strategy, nor management, nor an intelligent way of tackling a problem such as technical assistance. This had to be tackled. On the other hand, he was not in favour of doing without the ad hoc activities: there must be a margin for manoeuvre. The US representative had asked whether in a Ministerial periods, such as this year, there was an increase in requests of an ad hoc nature as concerns negotiation techniques, and the reply was affirmative. So when there was a Ministerial Conference, there was a need for additional flexibility. The Secretariat would take into account all that had been said. He noted that Members thought the questionnaire was not a bad approach. He hoped to be able to show improvements in the strategic orientation as soon as possible or for the next CTD in October.","WTCOMTDM34.pdf","Director-General, Ravier, WTO, US, Secretariat, Members, CTD"

The Director, Development Division, said that the issue of the proposed informal CTD and Budget meeting would be taken up in the framework of the discussion on technical cooperation. The Third Geneva Week for Non-Residents was scheduled for September 2001 in order to give the non-residents a clear picture of what was going on in Geneva as soon as possible after the July assessment of progress in the run-up to the Doha meeting. The 35th Session of the CTD on Monday, 8 October would include questions raised at the present meeting, such as GSP and various other topics which had been proposed to be carried forward, including the issue of S&D treatment.

Interested delegations had been constantly asking for some work to be carried out within the CTD to examine the constraints affecting the integration of small economies into the multilateral trading system. Consultations had been held in February 2001 and it had been agreed that terms of reference would be drawn up as a basis for a study to be conducted by the                                                                                       WT/COMTD/M/34                                                                                              Page 35 Secretariat. In March, the Secretariat drafted a set of terms of reference which were to form the basis for open-ended consultations to be conducted by the Chairman. These consultations were schedules for April-May but were postponed, and, unfortunately, it had not been possible as yet to re-schedule the discussion. Her delegation found that small economies were in a rather curious position of not only being marginalized within the multilateral trading system but also within the CTD. Her delegation requested that the issue be brought back of the forefront of the work of the Committee, and, specifically, requested that the business of the finalization of the terms of reference be the subject of the open-ended consultations conducted by the Chairman in the near future. She said that she hoped it would be possible to proceed with the approval of the study within a short time-frame, allowing the study to be carried out in a timely fashion.","WTCOMTDM34.pdf","Barbados, CTD, CTD, Secretariat, Secretariat, Chairman, CTD, Committee, Chairman"

A number of the AGOA beneficiaries were LDCs, however, the AGOA was not limited to African LDCs. Her delegation welcomed any comments from the CTD.

She said that the CTD had not seen any analysis from UNCTAD or the WTO Secretariats on the real implications of the new scheme. Such an analysis was needed since her country had certain difficulties about schemes which only favoured one category of countries. The GSP scheme was based on non-discrimination and non-reciprocity and she requested, the WTO Secretariat to carry out an analysis of the implications for developing countries of the different GSP schemes introduced in the last five years.

On the questions of rules of origin, there was nothing new in the notification. The US would provide a list of the beneficiaries for the Secretariat to circulate. The number of beneficiaries could hopefully be expanded. The discussion with respect to the notification for LDCs was similar to some of the discussions that took place when the U.S. delegation had announced its textiles liberalization at the end of 1994, in that a number of developing countries argued that the quota system provided guaranteed market access since they could not compete with larger developing countries in the textiles field. It was interesting to see that same dynamic in the request by the representative of Sri Lanka that the Secretariat conduct a study of the effects of preference programmes on other developing countries. Her delegation did not yet have a position on whether to conduct such a study, and wished to know more about it. The Chairman might inquiry informally about how such a study would be conducted. By the end of the year the US Government would have provided up to nearly US$2 million to the WTO specifically for capacity building efforts in Africa. The U.S. Government was constantly sending teams of expert to Africa to look at customs procedures and explain the implementation of the AGOA. She could provide a list of the number of teams sent to Africa to provide technical assistance, and she hoped that the AGOA might become a model for the U.S. Government for other developing countries. She would convey Zambia's comments on the AGOA seminar to Washington, and thanked the Secretariat for its help in conducting that seminar.

Her delegation was concern about that kind of development in the WTO. She recognized the concerns of LDCs, but there were certain countries which did not belong to the LDC category, which still shared some of the criteria for special treatment. She was aware that the Sub-Committee on LDCs was discussing these issues in detail, but the CTD was the major body of the LDCs Sub-Committee.

A transparent, non-discriminatory and rules-based multilateral trading system         is essential for LDCs to reap the potential benefits of globalisation. The accession of         LDCs to the WTO should be encouraged and facilitated. We commit ourselves to         seizing the opportunity of the fourth WTO Ministerial meeting in Doha in         November 2001, to advance the development dimension of trade, in particular for the         development of LDCs. We aim at improving preferential market access for LDCs by         working towards the objective of duty-free and quota-free market access for all         LDCs´ products in the markets of developed countries. Measures will also be taken         to address problems caused by supply-side constraints. The crucial importance of         trade and economic growth must be reflected in poverty reduction strategies."" The Plan of Action2 adopted at that same conference spelled out commitments in more detail, covering market access, technical assistance, services, the accession of WTO and regional trade. All that documentation would be made available as an official contribution for WTO approval as soon as possible. The text just read out showed the momentum to get to a situation where essentially all products were included in the scheme. The result of the LDC Conference was in line with the thinking which a number of delegations had developed in the CTD and also in the rest of the WTO lately. His delegation intended to build on that. Additional market access commitments would be welcomed, not only from developed countries, but from all WTO Members.","WTCOMTDM34.pdf","European, Communities, EC, UN, Conference, Brussels, LDCs, WTO, WTO, Doha, WTO, WTO, CTD, WTO, WTO, Members"

Participants at the Conference had committed themselves to implement fully, on a priority basis, special and differential (S&D) treatment for LDCs as it emerged from the results of the Uruguay Round. GSP schemes would continue to be improved in favour of the LDCs and technical assistance would be provided for the implementation of multilateral agreements. There was also a specific chapter on accessions to the WTO, which referred to the facilitation of the process for the least-developed countries. In addition, there were chapters on commodities, regional agreements, etc., but he wished to dwell on the chapter on market access, where the commitment was to increase and improve access to markets for LDCs, making certain that all the products exported by LDCs entered the markets of the developed countries duty- and quota-free. The primary responsibility was thus on developed countries to improve the access to their markets for products coming from LDCs.

The Conference was not an end itself, but the start of the process which should lead to many initiatives in favour of the least-developed countries. He was pleased to hear about the initiative announced by the representative of Norway. The Government of Norway had also played a crucial role in the concluding of the trade chapter and Plan of Action. Trade had figured prominently on the agenda of the Conference. There had been a thematic session on trade, there was a chapter on trade in the Plan of Action and a paragraph in the political declaration. The Declaration contained a political commitment by all countries having participated in the Conference to emphasize the development's dimension of trade in favour of the LDCs. The Fourth WTO Ministerial Conference in Doha would be an additional opportunity to show how the trade dimension could be reinforced for the LDCs. The LDC Conference had not been an end, but the start of a process, with the forthcoming WTO Ministerial Conference as its next stage.","WTCOMTDM34.pdf","Egypt, European, Union, Parliament, UNCTAD, Norway, Norway, LDCs, WTO, Ministerial, Conference, Doha, WTO, Ministerial, Conference"

Regarding the trade paragraph, he drew attention to the fact that a few delegations had some reservations on the specific language, which indicated that they agreed to the consensus, but that they had reservations about the text of the trade paragraph.","WTCOMTDM34.pdf","Korea, EC, UN"
"3284",3284,"56","56.     The representative of Haiti thanked and congratulated the European Union for holding the Conference. However, it was from implementation that LDCs would draw the maximum benefit from the Conference. Importance had to be given to the reinforcement of the production capacity of the LDCs in order for them to benefit from improved market access. The Conference had seen a useful report on the reinforcement of the Integrated Framework. The question of how to facilitate accession to the WTO for the LDCs had also been taken up. At the Doha Ministerial Conference, there should be agreement on assistance for development and trade, in particular for the LDCs. What remained was to implement the promises made during the LDC conference.","WTCOMTDM34.pdf","Haiti, European, Union, LDCs, Integrated, Framework, WTO, LDCs"

It was important to implement the decisions taken. Special efforts on the part of the world community, in particular by the developed countries, were needed to improve the economic situation of the LDCs. Both the Political Declaration and the Plan of Action should serve as guides to be translated into practice at the WTO.","WTCOMTDM34.pdf","Cuba, LDCs, Brussels, WTO"

He hoped others would follow the good examples. It was important to make market access predictable and for LDCs to use this market access and less stringent rules of origin to attract foreign investment. That might have been what Mr. Ricupero had referred to WT/COMTD/M/34 Page 10 in the JAG Report. Blending market access, harmonization of rules of origin and less stringent standards would be one important part of the developmental dimension mentioned at the Third UN Conference on the LDCs.

The representative of Tanzania expressed his appreciation to the EC for hosting the Third UN Conference on the LDCs and all the Member States who participated in that Conference.

During the Conference, the Government of the US had announced its contribution to the Integrated Framework Trust Fund, and would do so again at the next meeting of the Sub-Committee on Least-Developed Countries. The US Government had contributed US$200,000 to the Trust Fund, and was continuing its bilateral efforts to help increase the number of LDCs to benefit from the pilot scheme.

The representative of India said that he sought clarification from the representative of Norway on whether their GSP scheme would become effective from 1 July 2002 or whether there were any transition periods. Secondly, the representative of the EC had said that he hoped that, apart from developed countries, developing countries would also extend market access for LDCs. In that respect, it should be noted that, in terms of imports from LDCs as a percentage of total imports, Thailand and India were the top two counties.","WTCOMTDM34.pdf","India, Norway, EC, Thailand, India"

"3298",3298,"69","69.     The Chairman said that the International Conference on Financing for Development was scheduled for March 2002. Following extensive formal and informal consultations, it had been possible to accept the text contained in document WT/COMTD/30. He expressed his appreciation for the cooperation of Members and for the hard work put in right up to the final hours before the New York meeting to arrive at an acceptable document. He reminded Members that the text was in the form of a political statement, and did not constitute a binding legal commitment on Members. However, since the document was accepted by correspondence, it was fair to allow an opportunity for comments in the CTD for the record. The Members' contribution was taken to the Preparatory                                                                                    WT/COMTD/M/34                                                                                           Page 11 Committee for the meeting in New York on 2-8 May by Mr. Tulloch, Director, Development Division.","WTCOMTDM34.pdf","Chairman, Members, New, York, Members, Members, CTD, Members, Page, 11, Committee, New, York, Tulloch, Director"

The Chairman said that there were four outstanding requests for observer status on an ad hoc basis from the League of Arab States, OPEC, the Gulf Organization for Industrial Consulting and the Organisation Internationale de la Francophonie. Informal consultations had been held and it did not, as yet, appear to be a consensus on these requests. He therefore proposed to pass to the next item.","WTCOMTDM34.pdf","Chairman, League, of, Arab, States, OPEC, Gulf, Organization, for, Industrial, Consulting, Organisation, Internationale, de, la, Francophonie"

The main discussion on trade issues was held on Friday, 4 May, but he had been invited to speak on 3 May to present the WTO Members' input. He was also asked to speak on institutional aspects of ""coherence"" and the WTO's relationship with the UN system.

"3301",3301,"71","71.     The main substantive decision of the PrepCom was that the International Conference on Financing for Development would take place in Monterrey in Mexico on 18-22 March 2002. The meeting would have three segments: (i) a High-Level Official meeting; (ii) a Ministerial meeting where the Governments would be invited to send what was described as fully integrated delegations with representatives from all relevant national ministries; and, (iii) a summit meeting. All this information could be found on the UN website (http://www.un.org/esa/ffd). The members of the PrepCom very much welcomed the fact that WTO Members had been able to agree on a common statement, and they welcomed the fact that the statement had been delivered to the meeting.","WTCOMTDM34.pdf","Financing, for, Development, Monterrey, Mexico, UN, WTO, Members"
"3302",3302,"72","72.      The main discussion at the meeting had been on a paper presented by the Facilitator, Mr. Mauricio Escanero of Mexico, focussing on five cross-cutting issues. The first was global coherence in support financing for development, where the paper saw the challenge as how to embrace the coherence and consistency of the international monetary, financial, and trading systems in support of development. Second, on participation and ownership, the paper stated that enhancing was an important step to achieve the effective participation of the developing countries in relevant international decision-making on norm-setting as well as policy implementation. The paper emphasized the need to ensure responsiveness to the requirements of developing countries, and, in particular, the special needs of Africa, the least-developed countries, small and developing states, land-locked and transit developing countries, as well as countries with economies in transition. These have special difficulties in attracting finance for development. Lastly, they were promoting public/private partnerships in supporting the financing for development.","WTCOMTDM34.pdf","Mauricio, Escanero, Mexico, Africa"
"3303",3303,"73","73.      In respect of trade, the paper posed eight sets of questions: (i) how to support the enhancement of the development dimension of multilateral trade agreements; (ii) how to deepen the political momentum towards ensuring full market access of LDCs' exports to the markets industrialized countries; (iii) how best to enhance the contribution of regional and sub-regional cooperation and integration as building blocks to global trade and development; (iv) how to strengthen the contribution of the World Bank, governments, donors and other financial development institutions in support of diversified export capacity; (v) how to strengthen the existing international mechanism for compensatory balance-of-payments support in times of price shocks; (vi) how relevant international organizations could support developing countries by providing access to risk management instruments to cope with a persistent terms of trade decline and commodity prices instability; (vii) how international organizations could contribute to improve market access for the developing countries; and, (viii) what steps should be taken on a priority basis to match the requirements of technical and financial assistance for capacity building, including areas such as trade negotiations and dispute settlement, as well as, supporting implementation and how to support the Integrated Framework for LDCs and build that experience for enhancing the coherence of trade capacity building for other developing overlapping countries.","WTCOMTDM34.pdf","World, Bank, LDCs"
"3304",3304,"74","74.     The meeting recognized that there were two overlapping processes in the preparation of the WTO Ministerial Conference and the Preparatory Process for the FFD Conference. Great emphasis was put by all speakers, and, in particular the Group of 77, on trade as the most important element in external financing for development. It was universally recognised that the most important thing for WT/COMTD/M/34 Page 12 the trading system as a whole was that there should be a successful outcome at Doha, and the WTO must therefore concentrate on the successful preparation of the Doha meeting.","WTCOMTDM34.pdf","WTO, Doha, WTO, Doha"
"3305",3305,"75","75.      The next meeting of the Preparatory Committee was scheduled for 15-19 October. For that meeting, the Facilitator would present a ""first draft"" of a ""final outcome"" for consideration by members of the PrepCom; that paper should be available by the end of September. The Bureau of the Financing for Development Conference was very much concerned that the WTO should remain engaged in the PrepCom process. In parallel to the PrepCom, a high level panel appointed by the UN Secretary-General and headed by former President Zedillo of Mexico was preparing a report which was scheduled to be available by the end of May. This would also be posted on the FFD website when it became available. Finally, he emphasized that the day before the Preparatory Committee meeting started, the annual high level exchange of views between the international financial institutions and ECOSOC had been held and it had been strongly suggested that the WTO be involved in the corresponding event in 2002.","WTCOMTDM34.pdf","Preparatory, Committee, Financing, for, Development, Conference, WTO, UN, Zedillo, Mexico, Preparatory, Committee, ECOSOC, WTO"

The representative of Turkey expressed his appreciation to the Chair, as well as the Secretariat and the Committee, for the great efforts which enabled the CTD to deliver the contribution of the WTO to the UN PrepCom for the Conference on Financing for Development. It had not been easy to conclude a consensus text containing different varieties of issues which were important for all. Indeed, his delegation was still not happy with the language used in one sentence in paragraph 11 which stated that ""… many Members consider that reduction of high tariffs, tariff peaks and tariff escalation would benefit a number of areas of export interest to developing countries, including, for example, in textiles and clothing, where in addition the main liberalisation agreed in the Uruguay Round has yet to take place."" His delegation was certainly not one of the Members mentioned in that sentence, but had an opposite view on the matter. However, his delegation had not wanted to insist on a position which would have prolonged the debate unnecessarily and had remained silent during the discussions. He appreciated the opportunity to express his delegation's concern on that subject which would also be discussed in the preparation for the Ministerial.","WTCOMTDM34.pdf","Turkey, Secretariat, Committee, CTD, WTO, UN, Members, Uruguay, Round, Members"

The representative of Saint Lucia said that her delegation was interested in the Conference on Financing for Development and was glad that the WTO had been able to make a contribution, although her delegation would preferred a more ambitious statement, reflecting her government's particular concerns. However, she understood that it was a political statement which had been well received in New York. She asked for Mr. Tulloch's statement to be distributed.","WTCOMTDM34.pdf","Saint, Lucia, WTO, New, York, Tulloch"
"3309",3309,"79","79.      The representative of Cuba said that her delegation did not agree with the contribution in document WT/COMTD/30. She said she wished to state the disappointment of the Cuban authorities concerning the content of the document. The WTO contribution should have been more substantive, reflecting the real issues which developing countries face in international trade. The document should not have been limited to identifying the problems being faced at present, but should have defined the means to reverse the existing situation. The report should have been more critical as regards the role developed countries could and should play in supporting development. The solutions proposed, which imposed obligations on developing countries to create internal resources, did not take into account the situation which developing countries faced, nor the diversity of these problems. Her delegation did not believe that there was a direct or automatic relationship between trade liberalization at the international level and the promotion of economic growth. She reserved her delegation's right in forthcoming meetings and at the Conference on Financing for Development to set out her Government's views with regard to what should have been part of the WTO's contribution.

That was a welcome approach. However, his delegation still believed that the document – although not perfect – was a useful contribution to the discussions, and he was pleased to be able to provide a collective input to the Conference, while recognizing that not every word was acceptable for everybody.

At the same time, their views were focused on March 2002.

The Chairman said that for Agenda Item F, a document entitled ""Special And Differential Treatment: Implementation and Proposals"" (WT/COMTD/W/85) had been prepared by the Secretariat. The discussion in the CTD was not intended to duplicate the implementation-related work going on in the General Council. Nevertheless, the Secretariat paper contained interesting material which the CTD could discuss as an input to Members' thinking in the wider context of the future of S&D provisions in the WTO Agreements.","WTCOMTDM34.pdf","Chairman, Secretariat, CTD, General, Council, Secretariat, CTD, Members, WTO"
"3315",3315,"84","84.      The Director, Development Division, said he had two matters to raise: first, the Secretariat paper, WT/COMTD/W/85, and, second, the work which had been requested on the GSP. Document WT/COMTD/W/85 was the most recent in a series of documents reflecting the state of discussions on S&D treatment. The document followed the same pattern used in the previous document (WT/COMTD/W/77) and contained two main elements. First, it updated information which had been provided in WT/COMTD/W/77 on the implementation of S&D provisions, covering developments through the Autumn 2000 and Spring 2001 in the following Agreements, Understandings, and Decisions: the Understanding on Balance-of-Payments Provisions, the Agreement on Agriculture, the Decision Concerning the Possible Negative Effects of the Reform Programme on Least-Developed and Net-Food Importing Developing Countries, the SPS Agreement, the TBT Agreement, the Anti-Dumping Agreement, the Subsidies Agreement, the GATS (references had been made to the guidelines and procedures established by the GATS Council in document S/L/93), the TRIPS Agreement, and the Decision on Measures in Favour of Least-Developed Countries. Second, Section III of the document referred specifically to written proposals related to S&D treatment which were made by Members in the negotiations on agriculture in a recent special session of the Committee on Agriculture and statements made at that meeting. The paper gave a clear and graphic view of developments in the discussion on S&D treatment, which was engaged in relation to all agreements and Ministerial decisions. The objective of the paper was also to provide useful background information for Members' discussions on the future development of S&D. WT/COMTD/M/34 Page 14 The Committee should certainly not pre-empt the work of the General Council, it should rather feed into the discussions under the oversight of the General Council.","WTCOMTDM34.pdf","Director, Development, Division, Secretariat, GSP, Reform, Programme, GATS, Council, Members, Committee, on, Agriculture, Members, Committee, General, Council, General, Council"
"3316",3316,"85","85.      The Chairman said that the task before the CTD on S&D treatment reflected one of the core functions of the CTD, namely to keep under review the different provisions in WTO Agreements which pertained to developing countries. The discussions in the CTD and those which had taken place elsewhere showed that there was a considerable body of opinion among Members pointing to the need to rethink and fine-tune the concept of S&D treatment to make it more responsive to the specific constraints faced by developing countries in their integration into the multilateral trading system and the implementation of trade policy reform.                 The CTD's discussions of document WT/COMTD/W/85 and its predecessor could be a useful platform to support Member's efforts in collectively thinking about the concept of S&D treatment.","WTCOMTDM34.pdf","Chairman, CTD, CTD, WTO, CTD, Members, CTD, Member"

The representative of Pakistan said that the compilation indicated the various provisions relating to S&D treatment in various agreements in a synoptic manner, and also provided an overview of what had been done on S&D provisions. Referring to Section J dealing with Services, he asked the Secretariat to clarify or elaborate on the comments made in relation to Article IV:I of the GATS. The comments stated that ""The requirements of the provisions of this article are reflected in S/L/93 ""Guidelines and Procedures for the Negotiations on Trade in Services"" as adopted by the Council for Trade in Services on 28 March 2001.

The representative of Paraguay also referred to Section J on Services and asked the Secretariat if it would be possible to indicate in the comments the paragraph of the guidelines to which it was referring. On Section 3 of the document, there had been proposals from Members at the Special Session on Agriculture. However, in the negotiations on Services, there had also been proposals on S&D treatment for developing countries – perhaps not many, but they did exist and the proposals presented by Norway should help the LDCs.

The representative of the European Communities said that as pointed out, there was an implementation debate where some of these proposals were being raised as well as a general debate on S&D. It would be useful to pause and reflect on what could usefully be done. He asked whether WT/COMTD/W/85 was just a reference document that should be brought to the next discussion in the General Council, or whether it should be furthered in the CTD. His delegation had an open mind in that respect. The discussion on S&D could take place in the General Council as well as in the CTD.

"3324",3324,"92","92.     The representative of Morocco said that he was of the view that the implementation of S&D treatment had not been sufficient to balance the rights and obligations of each Member. S&D treatment had not spared the economies of LDCs from marginalization. Furthermore, although S&D was an indispensable tool, it had to go far enough for people to see their commitments fulfilled. While S&D continued to foster international development and cooperation, it should be more pragmatic in addressing the difficulties encountered by developing countries in the implementation of commitments.","WTCOMTDM34.pdf","Morocco, Member"
"3325",3325,"93","93.     The representative of Canada said that a few weeks prior to the CTD meeting, there had been an informal Special Session of the General Council on S&D treatment, and about 18 delegations had noted that nothing had been done on S&D treatment.                     So she had now re-read document WT/COMTD/W/77 in depth and tried to understand what had been proposed and what had been done. She said that she had been struck by how much had been done and the fact that the opportunities in the S&D treatment provisions had not been fully used.

"3326",3326,"94","94.     The representative of Uruguay asked the Secretariat how provisions relating to transfer of technology were treated in the document. Recently, there had been a seminar at the WTO in collaboration with UNCTAD and other organizations, on the transfer of technology. One of the conclusions was that provisions of technology in the WTO Agreement had not yet been implemented. The document on S&D treatment showed that technology transfer existed in one or other of the six categories on S&D. In the Services Agreement, under paragraph 1 of Article 4, there was a reference to the need to strengthen national capacity in Services, which could be achieved through access to technology. However, the Secretariat had included that in the category ""provisions aimed at increasing the trade opportunities of developing country Members"". Article 66.2 of the TRIPS Agreement also stated that developed countries should transfer technology to the LDCs and the Secretariat had included that article on the transfer of technology among the provisions related to LDCs. Provisions related to the transfer of technology thus appeared in various categories. He asked whether if would not be wise to create a new category on technology transfer, as it deserved, given its importance.

The representative of Cuba said that the document constituted a good source of information for developing countries to identify and to develop measures in order to improve the implementation of S&D treatment.

"3331",3331,"99","99.      The Director, Development Division thanked delegations for all the comments. It was important to be clear that the document WT/COMTD/W/85 was not an attempt to repeat the information in WT/COMTD/W/77 which listed the complete range of 145 provisions of S&D treatment contained in the WTO Agreements. The current document only showed where there the S&D provisions with respect to which there had been proposals or action taken. If there were no new developments since the previous document, the provision had not been included. For example, in textiles, there had been no new work and no new proposals made so the S&D provisions with respect to textiles were not covered. That approach should perhaps have stated more clearly. The Secretariat would look at the services section again to try to be more helpful to the delegations in linking precise used had originally been set up for the High Level Symposium on Trade and Development in 1999. Provisions on transfer of technology would, generally, fall under one of the categories of S&D, most likely under the ""provisions aimed at increasing trade opportunities for developing country Members"". The treatment of LDCs was cross-cutting because all fields had provisions specifically related to LDCs. However, the Secretariat could do some work in that area. The representative of India had asked to keep the issue open. However, it was difficult to produce updates for every meeting of the Committee but the Secretariat would see what could be done. With respect to the point made in the second intervention by the representative of Pakistan, he said that the only objective of the document had been to provide information on what measures had been taken to operationalize S&D treatment provisions. If the document could make a positive contribution to the debate in the CTD or the General Council, then that was valuable. He took note of the point by the representative of Canada that the document could also show what S&D provisions had not been implemented and what S&D provisions had not been used.","WTCOMTDM34.pdf","Director, Development, Division, WTO, Secretariat, S&D, Members, Secretariat, India, Committee, Secretariat, Pakistan, CTD, General, Council, Canada"

Referring to a number of products covered by the scheme, he noted that it went beyond the EBA-initiative of the EC in that it included revolvers and pistols.

"3347",3347,"101","101. The representative of Côte d'Ivoire said that his delegation accepted the excuse by the Chairman. However, every time there was an important document to discuss, it seemed to be available in English only. The fact that the document was only available in English made the work more difficult for his delegation. His delegation supported what had been said by the representative of the European Communities. Even though all developing countries faced difficulties, the type of difficulties varied from country to country which made it necessary for any technical assistance provided to be targeted at the specific needs of each country. His delegation had asked for assistance in customs-valuation as the customs authorities in his country faced problems in the application of certain texts adopted at the WTO because of a lack of training of customs officials. That was what he meant by targeted tailor-made training which could even be given in the country itself. Ideally, a certain degree of coherence should be guaranteed between the technical assistance given at the sub- regional level where countries were in the process of integrating. Sub-regional technical assistance programmes could then be harmonized with WTO technical assistance. The usefulness of technical assistance provided could otherwise diminish. It was important that the support for the JITAP be maintained and consolidated for it to be extended. Some had already benefitted from the JITAP while others were still to benefit. The document, although interesting, was yet not complete. He therefore suggested that once specific technical assistance programmes had been decided upon, there would be the possibility for the concerned Members to discuss them with the Secretariat in order to make the technical assistance provided as effective as possible.","WTCOMTDM35.pdf","Côte, d'Ivoire, Chairman, WTO, WTO, Members, Secretariat"
"3348",3348,"102","102. The representative of Norway said that the principle of comparative advantage often was stressed in the WTO and that it should guide the WTO's work on technical assistance as well. However, no matter how important the issue of technical assistance and capacity building was, the WTO should not primarily become a development organization. Coherence was important. The WTO had a role to play together with other relevant organizations, and not the least, with national governments. One of the main weaknesses of the current regime was the lack of predictable financing and the following ad-hoc character of some technical assistance provided. An increase in the regular WT/COMTD/M/35 Page 26 budget, allowing for more predictable technical assistance did not necessarily mean increased costs for all Members. That was a technical issue that could be addressed in its own way.","WTCOMTDM35.pdf","Norway, WTO, WTO, WTO, WTO, Members"
"3349",3349,"103","103. The representative of Morocco said that his delegation was happy with the implementation of the new approach proposed in the Strategy which it hoped would respond to the expectations of developing and LDCs as technical assistance was crucial for the effective implementation of WTO Agreements. To date, the assistance provided had only provided information instead of a true training of trainers. The new Strategy seemed to rectify that situation and permit real capacity building. As far as financing was concerned, it was clear that enhanced predictability would give more substance to the new approach. The new approach regarding national focal points was essential. It was currently a substantial gap between the different technical departments involved in WTO matters. The identification of focal points would result in enhanced local coordination. The new approach would also reinforce regional integration. As far as cooperation with universities was concerned, his delegation reiterated its proposal to organize, in collaboration with the Secretariat, a third cycle of specific studies of WTO-specific issues. That initiative could be carried out within an African framework in order for African students to familiarize themselves with WTO matters.","WTCOMTDM35.pdf","Morocco, LDCs, WTO, WTO, Secretariat, WTO"
"3350",3350,"104","104. The Director of the Technical Cooperation Division said that the Secretariat had appreciated the constructive comments made by delegations which would guide the Secretariat in the implementation of the new Strategy. With respect to the implementation of the new Strategy he said that as soon as Members had taken note of it, the Secretariat would collate the views expressed and intended to take up the practical issues that would arise, not only within the Technical Cooperation Division, but also make an appropriate presentation to the TAMC. He proposed that the Secretariat proceed with the conclusion of the tripartite, and in some cases, the quadrilateral MoUs referred to (quadrilateral with regard to the MoU with the Arab region). There had been a suggestion for the inclusion of the Economic Commission for Africa for the Arab region. The Secretariat would begin to develop, on a more systematic basis, and refine the Coordinated Plan for WTO Technical Assistance. The Plan would be revised for the year 2002 and that would be the test on the basis of which Members should judge the Secretariat's implementation of the Strategy. The Coordinated Plan should reflect the Strategy and the comments made by Members. Several delegations had mentioned the issue of mainstreaming. There was a limit to the delivery of WTO technical assistance as a mechanism for mainstreaming trade-priorities into strategies for poverty reduction and development plans. In pursuing that objective, the Secretariat would be operating within an inter-agency framework. The reason the WTO Secretariat had to work with the other agencies was the guidance Members had given. Although trade was recognized as an engine for growth within the more development-oriented institutions, trade-components were not normally ensured parts of development plans. What the Membership had told the Secretariat was that the WTO, as a primary trade institution, should champion the integration of trade priority areas of action into development plans. The Secretariat would be doing as it had been mandated, taking into account that mainstreaming should be less abstract and more nationally oriented.","WTCOMTDM35.pdf","Director, Technical, Cooperation, Division, Secretariat, Secretariat, Members, Secretariat, Technical, Cooperation, Division, TAMC, Secretariat, MoUs, Economic, Commission, Africa, Secretariat, WTO, Members, Secretariat, Members, WTO, Secretariat, WTO, Secretariat, Members, Secretariat, WTO, Secretariat"
"3351",3351,"105","105. He continued by saying that there had been several questions about how the various approaches would relate to the Strategy. The Secretariat believed that it should proceed on the basis of a tools-box approach. Some of the approaches could not be reconciled, but that only meant that they operated on different tracks. What the Secretariat would endeavour to do was that, with respect to specific elements and depending on the national situation, a particular approach, for instance the agreement-by-agreement approach, would be applied to advance a particular aspect of the Strategy. Some delegations had mentioned the varying national needs and those were covered in Section III of the Plan which contained a design of country-specific technical assistance, essentially based on demands made to the Secretariat. That individual developing countries had different needs was the rationale behind the separate section focussing on country-specific activities. There had been some comments as to what the WTO technical assistance should do and it had been mentioned that it would be judged by the extent to which it assisted developing countries increase their share of world trade,                                                                                    WT/COMTD/M/35                                                                                           Page 27 not just in the multilateral trading system but also in the global economy. That was why one of the core elements was mainstreaming and why WTO had to work with other international agencies.","WTCOMTDM35.pdf","Secretariat, Secretariat, Secretariat, WTO, WTO"
"3352",3352,"106","106. He went on to say that there had been a suggestion for periodic reports to the CTD on the functioning and discussions in the TAMC and he said that it would be discussed with senior management but he was optimistic that such a procedure could be agreed to. There had been questions of supply-side responses and those related to mainstreaming as the WTO did not have country-offices and could only work at two levels to address the supply-side issues: with the bilateral donors and with other agencies (World Bank, IMF and UNDP in particular). Bilateral donors had begun to dedicate more resources to supply-side responses and had been showing the way for the new WTO Strategy. Turning to technical cooperation in Geneva which some delegations had mentioned he said that time and resources of the Secretariat were dedicated to providing technical assistance to the entire Membership. Attention had also been given to non-residents for the past three years. On JITAP he said that the WTO continued to provide technical assistance in the tripartite collaboration with ITC and UNCTAD. There was a clearly designed programme for the WTO modules in the JITAP programme. JITAP had been designed to come to an end at the end of 2001 even as a consolidation programme was under way. It was a matter for donors to decide what to do with the JITAP. The Secretariat had been asked informally to see how the JITAP and the IF could be merged, not necessarily involving the disappearance of the JITAP which was a successful and robust programme that had worked well at the grass-root level. The Secretariat would have to come back to Members as the negotiations between beneficiaries and donors evolved. The point hat had been made about reconciling regional programmes related to regional integration agreements with the WTO technical assistance. That was what the Secretariat wished to achieve as could be seen in the Annexes and in working with various other international and regional organizations. Djibouti would be included in the list of Arab countries. That had already been pointed out by a colleague who had been specifically recruited to work on Arab countries. The Secretariat would take the comments made by delegations into account when implementing the Strategy.","WTCOMTDM35.pdf","CTD, TAMC, WTO, World, Bank, IMF, UNDP, WTO, Strategy, Geneva, Secretariat, WTO, ITC, UNCTAD, WTO, Secretariat, Secretariat, Members, WTO, Secretariat, Djibouti, Secretariat"
"3353",3353,"107","107. The Committee took note of the New Strategy for WTO Technical Cooperation, the Coordinated WTO Plan for Technical Assistance Activities and authorized the Secretariat to proceed with its implementation on the understanding that the Secretariat would take those comments into account when implementing the Strategy and the Plan.

"3354",3354,"108","108. The Director of the WTO Training Institute said that, as Members would recall, they had already been informed, during a recent session of the General Council, of the decision by the Director-General to reorganize the Training Division of the WTO Secretariat. That division had become the WTO Training Institute. The document before Members presented the future activities of the Institute which went beyond the trade-policy courses organized up to then by the Training Division. The new activities included training of trainers, a range of short-term courses, distance- learning services as well as extended cooperation with universities and other educational establishments. To introduce the document, he wished to make the following remarks. First, financing had not yet been assured for some of the scheduled activities as they would largely depend on extra budgetary resources. However, he was confident that some donors would continue to contribute as some of the activities had become ""traditional"" in the training programme. That was for example the case of the programmes for the LDCs as well as the training on rules and procedures of the dispute settlement system. He took the opportunity to thank the donors who continued to support the training activities.","WTCOMTDM35.pdf","Director, WTO, Training, Institute, Members, General, Council, Director-General, WTO, Secretariat, WTO, Training, Institute, Members, Institute"
"3355",3355,"109","109. Second, certain new activities, especially those relating to distance learning, could not be undertaken unless new sources of financing could be found rapidly. An appeal to donors had been WT/COMTD/M/35 Page 28 launched. However, a balance had to be struck between increased human resources (funds for new trainers for example), increased financial resources (funds for additional fellowships for example), and improvements to or new acquisitions of the training equipment (such as new training rooms). Some concrete proposals to that effect would soon be presented, in the context of but not exclusively when the draft 2002 budget was to be presented.","WTCOMTDM35.pdf",""
"3356",3356,"11","11.     The representatives of Guinea, Madagascar and Côte d'Ivoire supported the statement made by the representative of the European Communities and noted that the OIF was working together with the WTO on technical assistance matters for African least-developed countries (LDCs).","WTCOMTDM35.pdf","Guinea, Madagascar, WTO"
"3357",3357,"110","110. Third, the document explained what the Institute would be in a position to offer to its beneficiaries in terms of training courses. This ""offer"", which was currently quantitatively quite limited, constituted an initial but modest response to the needs for capacity building. However, it would enable the beneficiaries to plan the training of their officials responsible for WTO matters and it would be important that the beneficiaries indicated, on the basis of that offer, the type of training they wished to receive from the WTO in the future.","WTCOMTDM35.pdf","Institute, WTO, WTO"
"3358",3358,"111","111. Fourth, the programme of activities presented by the Training Institute was in line with the new WTO Technical Cooperation Strategy. The fact that there was an addendum to the Strategy containing the plan for technical assistance activities and that the Training Institute had issued a separate document should not be interpreted as expressing a special situation which should be dealt with aside from the Strategy and the other technical cooperation activities. It was only because of the different nature of the activities. Many of the activities of the Training Institute had not yet been financed and as and when funding was found they could be included in the new document to be issued before the end of the year which would be considered by the TAMC at a later date. The Training Institute was an integral part of the Strategy. The reason why the document on the Training Institute referred to a two-year period was that only one fellowship per country could be offered every two years with the current availability of resources. If the Director-General succeeded in his request for doubling the capacity, the Training Institute would also be able to work on a yearly basis. It was clear that there were some overlap and duplication between training and technical cooperation activities. In a somewhat arbitrary but pragmatic manner it had been determined that any activity undertaken in Geneva fell under the Training Institute while all activities in the field belonged to technical cooperation.","WTCOMTDM35.pdf","Training, Institute, WTO, Technical, Cooperation, Strategy, Training, Institute, Training, Institute, TAMC, Training, Institute, Training, Institute, Director-General, Training, Institute, Geneva, Training, Institute"
"3359",3359,"112","112. Fifth, the coherence and complementarity between the activities of the Institute and the ones carried out in the field in technical cooperation constituted one of the priorities of the Secretariat. The role of the TAMC, chaired by Deputy Director-General Ravier was to look after the implementation of that priority. There was also the Joint Consultative Board on WTO-related Training which regrouped representatives of UNCTAD, ITC and the World Bank as well as the chairmen of certain WTO bodies such as the Budget Committee, the Committee on Trade and Development and the Sub-Committee on Least-Developed Countries. All these representatives were being contacted with a view to organizing a first meeting before the Fourth Ministerial Meeting. The Joint Consultative Board on WTO-related Training would also have a role to play in the coordination of WTO activities. He ensured delegations that, with respect to on-line training and modern information technologies, there was a pilot project about to be launched and for which financing was sought from Members. Consideration was also given to provide those courses in parallel on CD-ROMs to provide the same material off-line as well. However, CD-ROMs did pose the problem of monitoring and follow-up but the possibility was being studied. With the cooperation of the Technical Cooperation Division, links would be made to all regions as far as the training of trainers, distance learning and contacts with universities were concerned. Since the establishment of the Institute in June 2001, two agreements had been signed with universities on WTO-related training and it was nice to hear at the present meeting that Members were working on the same thing.","WTCOMTDM35.pdf","Institute, Secretariat, TAMC, Director-General, Ravier, Joint, Consultative, Board, UNCTAD, ITC, World, Bank, WTO, Budget, Committee, Committee, on, Trade, and, Development, Joint, Consultative, Board, on, WTO-related, Training, WTO, Members, Technical, Cooperation, Division, Institute, Members"

Such information could back up requests for funding.","WTCOMTDM35.pdf","European, Communities, Training, Institute, Members"
"3362",3362,"115","115. The representative of the Secretariat said that the participants in the trade-policy courses visited WIPO and received a lecture on the TRIPS Agreement and other aspects on TRIPS by WIPO officials for a full day. That was in parallel to the training they received on the same Agreement and in more detail from WTO officials. That cooperation did not go beyond the other existing extensive cooperation between the Intellectual Property Division in the WTO Secretariat and WIPO set out in a special agreement. The collaboration of WIPO had been sought as far as the setting up a distance learning facility was concerned. WIPO had an Academy since mid-2000 and had experience in setting up on-line, computer-based training courses. The WTO Secretariat hoped to benefit from their experience. However, the relations between the WIPO Academy and the WTO Training Institute did not preclude any other activity taking place at the level of the cooperation programme set up between WIPO and the rest of the Secretariat, in particular the Intellectual Property Division and the training that went on in the field and elsewhere.","WTCOMTDM35.pdf","Secretariat, WIPO, WIPO, WTO, Intellectual, Property, Division, WTO, Secretariat, WIPO, WIPO, WIPO, WTO, Secretariat, WIPO, Academy, WTO, Training, Institute, WIPO, Secretariat, Intellectual, Property, Division"
"3363",3363,"116","116. He went on to say that the idea of a WTO Training Institute had come up in the context of better responding to the needs of developing countries in the areas of distance learning, training of trainers as well as enhanced collaboration with universities. Universities were important sources of developing country training and closer relationships between the WTO and universities would enhance knowledge of WTO matters. It was also the idea of providing better services and having a broader outreach to the most relevant ""clientele"". That the Training Institute had been created in June 2001 was not unrelated to financing either. It was believed that, with a Training Institute, it would be easier to seek financing from foundations as the General Council recently had authorized. Private foundations might find it more appealing to fund a Training Institute than a Division of the WTO Secretariat. The Institute, in its current form, was only a first step in what it could become. Well-designed projects had to be developed before additional human and financial resources were sought. Without any additional increase in resources, the Institute was currently preparing pilot projects in various areas for financing. However, the current staff had been working harder since the creation of the Institute to come up with concrete plans and projects to implement the mandate received from the Director-General.","WTCOMTDM35.pdf","WTO, Training, Institute, WTO, WTO, Training, Institute, Training, Institute, General, Council, Training, Institute, WTO, Secretariat, Institute, Institute, Institute, Director-General"

He said that he wished to highlight some of the technical assistance activities implemented by UNIDO in the context of WTO Agreements. The submission by the delegation of Côte d'Ivoire had mentioned the UEMOA Treaty. UNIDO was initiating implementation of an EU/UEMOA/UNIDO initiative in capacity building in the fields of accreditation, standardization and quality promotion aiming at facilitating trade and reducing poverty in West Africa. 12.5 million Euros were available for the eight countries in West Africa. A similar initiative was currently under preparation for 14 other countries and a regional workshop had been held in August 2001. In line with the Millennium Declaration, and based on requests made by the vice-presidents of six Central American countries, UNIDO was designing an integrated programme at the regional level with a view to eliminate non-tariff barriers to trade affecting market access related to the SPS and TBT Agreements. Multilateral organizations had been invited to participate in the context of the High-Level Committee on Programmes meeting of the UN System and Bretton Woods institutions to ensure coordination. UNIDO was working closely with the ITC, with which UNIDO had signed a cooperation agreement a few weeks earlier, and with UNCTAD, FAO and WHO and would welcome WTO participation in such initiatives in the future.

The Director of the Development Division said that the third Geneva Week for WTO Members and Observers without representation in Geneva had been held from 10-14 September 2001. Sixty-three participants from 34 countries had attended, as had representatives of 32 regional secretariats and agencies working directly with non-resident members. The third Geneva Week had been financed by contributions from the governments of the United States, South Korea, and Germany. The Geneva Week was one of a number of initiatives aimed at enhancing the capacity of non-resident Members to take part in the work of the WTO, and had a number of objectives. It provided for comprehensive briefings on various aspects of the WTO's work programme; time for consultation with WTO officials and Geneva-based delegations; and hands on training in the use of IT tools.","WTCOMTDM35.pdf","Director, Development, Division, WTO, Members, Geneva, United, States, South, Korea, Germany, Members, WTO, WTO, WTO"

Non-residents had been briefed by the Secretariat and the Chairman of the General Council on the process undertaken under the General Council to develop a draft Ministerial Declaration, and on the work that was on-going under the Implementation Review Mechanism. The Chairman of the General Council had also set aside some time to consult directly with non-residents on their concerns and aspirations in relation to the Ministerial Conference, in order to take these into account in the drafting of the Ministerial Declaration. Non-residents had been given extensive briefings on work in the following areas: Agriculture; Services; Intellectual Property; Sanitary and Phyto-Sanitary Measures; Technical Barriers to Trade; Market Access; Trade facilitation; Rules of Origin; Customs Valuation; Trade and Investment; Trade and Competition Policy; and Technical Cooperation and Training. In a number of those areas, non-residents benefitted from complementary presentations made by invited international organisations, and, in the case of briefings on technical cooperation, by bi-lateral partners (the Department for International Development, UK; USAID; and the European Commission's Directorate General for Trade).                         He also thanked Ambassador Perez-Motta of Mexico who had shared with non-residents his perspectives on the WTO and development-related issues.","WTCOMTDM35.pdf","Geneva, Week, Secretariat, Chairman, General, Council, General, Council, Chairman, General, Council, Intellectual, Property, Customs, Valuation, Department, for, International, Development, UK, USAID, European, Commission, 's, Directorate, General, for, Trade, Ambassador, Perez-Motta, Mexico, WTO"

An innovation of this year's Geneva Week had been to invite the representatives of secretariats of regional organisations and agencies which work closely with non-residents. Collaboration with these organisations was an important element in the WTO's strategy to build the capacity of non-residents to take part in the WTO. Invited organisations and agencies had given an overview of their methods and mechanisms for building capacity, sharing information and coordinating negotiating positions amongst their constituent members. The discussion had been enriched by the insights provided by the European Commission and Romania, for the Central European Free Trade Association, on what possible options Members had at their disposal to achieve coordination and a collective sharing of the burden of WTO work.","WTCOMTDM35.pdf","Geneva, Week, WTO, WTO, European, Commission, Romania, Central, European, Free, Trade, Association, Members, WTO"

The options detailed in the study usually involved some element of cooperation on a regional basis, and the pooling of resources. The concrete implementation of those options could be facilitated by the involvement of donors, as well as cooperation with existing agencies that provided specific services to non-residents, most notably the Agency for International Trade Information and Cooperation (AITIC) and The Commonwealth Secretariat. The WTO, as an agency, stood ready to work closely with Members on initiatives they might seek to take.","WTCOMTDM35.pdf","Geneva, Week, Commonwealth, Secretariat, Geneva, Agency, for, International, Trade, Information, and, Cooperation, Commonwealth, Secretariat, WTO, Members"

The majority of participants who returned completed forms signalled that Geneva Week had met their main objectives, namely to prepare them for the Fourth Ministerial Conference by gaining a better understanding of WTO issues. The majority thought that the structure of the Geneva Week was good, though many would have preferred more time for greater in-depth treatment of issues and for interaction with Geneva-based delegations. An independent gauge of the usefulness of Geneva Week might also be found in the fact some non residents have – despite their absence from Geneva – played an active part in recent days by providing written comments to the Chairman of the General Council on the draft Ministerial Declaration.","WTCOMTDM35.pdf","Geneva, Week, WTO, Geneva, Week, Geneva, Chairman, General, Council"

SESSION I:      REGULATION AND DEREGULATION","WTCOMTDM35.pdf","Chairman, WTO"
"3387",3387,"138","138.     The first session dealt with the question of what could be the most appropriate domestic legal framework to reap the benefits of e-commerce. It was stated that governments, together with the private sector and civil society, have an important role to play in creating an enabling environment for e-commerce. A legal framework is necessary to enhance the benefits from e-commerce; however, governments should not over-regulate and regulations adopted should be technology neutral. Areas mentioned in which governments need to take action include:         1.      building trust in the digital market place (privacy, cryptography, consumer                 protection);         2.      clarifying market rules (legal framework, taxation, trade rules, IP policies);         3        A previous seminar on the development implications of e-commerce was held on 19 February 1999 (WT/COMTD/18).

"3388",3388,"139","139.     Information and communication technologies and e-commerce pose challenges for governments as they have to rethink how they set the rules for the marketplace. One particular challenge is to strike a correct balance between government regulation and laissez-faire. Barriers to trade can come from over-regulation, effectively limiting choices and opportunities in markets, as well as from a lack of regulation resulting in lost opportunities because of insecurity and distrust. International harmonization of national regulations can enhance choices and crate opportunities.","WTCOMTDM35.pdf",""

"3390",3390,"140","140.     The rapid development and diffusion of e-commerce requires a broad collaborative approach by governments, the private sector, civil society and international organizations. E-commerce cannot be regulated in the old, classical sense; it needs ""co-regulation"", i.e. a mixed public and private approach, integrating government regulation and legislation with business practices and civil society concerns. The priorities for both government and industry should be to foster confidence in the instruments and networks of e-commerce. The role of the government should be to meet the public interest in creating an environment for global e-commerce in which the ground rules are appropriate, clear and predictable. Unnecessary international legal and regulatory barriers should be eliminated and the emergence of new ones prevented. The role of the private sector is to stimulate growth of global e-commerce through investment and dynamic innovation in products and services. Civil society must play a role in efforts to facilitate the growth of e-commerce and maximize its potential in social, civic and community development. International cooperation is very important in creating a seamless environment for e-commerce.","WTCOMTDM35.pdf",""
"3391",3391,"141","141.

"3392",3392,"142","142.    Problems of a legal nature seen as arising from e-commerce include requirements for paper documents and signatures, evidence storage, the validity of data messages, and the validity and formation of contracts made by electronic means. Other issues which can constitute barriers to e-commerce include consumer protection, authentication and security, jurisdiction and applicable law, taxation, Internet content regulation, computer crime, data privacy, negotiability (bills of lading).","WTCOMTDM35.pdf",""
"3393",3393,"143","143.     Effective provisions regarding electronic signatures were seen as a necessity for legislation. It is technically possible to have authentication, message integrity and no repudiation (i.e. the sender cannot later claim that he/she had not sent a particular message) for electronic signatures. However, legal frameworks are missing. There is also a lack of clarity as to on-line dispute resolution with respect to consumer claims, arbitration, mediation and insurance complaints for example. Questions arise as to which law applies and as to which court has jurisdiction. The solutions could be for a country to sign an international convention, adopt international instruments, use national legislation, or allow for contractual solutions and self-regulation.","WTCOMTDM35.pdf",""
"3394",3394,"144","144.    An international convention would bring certain benefits, for example in solving problems of harmonization. In the meantime, a tool for countries wanting to implement legislation on e-commerce today could be the UNCITRAL model laws and guidelines (UNCITRAL Law on e-commerce 1996 and the UNCITRAL uniform rules on electronic signatures). At least provisions replicating the UNCITRAL model law might be necessary in each country. Another international source from which some countries have received inspiration is the European Communities' directives on digital signatures and e-commerce. Another approach could be for governments to adopt codes of conduct WT/COMTD/M/35 Page 34 regulations. OECD and ECE UN/CEFACT are sources of information on codes of conduct. Instead of having to wait for legislation, contractual solutions could be found. One example is the model EDI Agreement (interchange agreement) of the European Communities. One of the problems associated with contractual solutions is the privacy of contracts, i.e. contracts do not relate to third parties. Another is that some governments do not enforce contractual provisions.","WTCOMTDM35.pdf","UNCITRAL, UNCITRAL, UNCITRAL, UNCITRAL, OECD"
"3395",3395,"145","145.     Cross-certification between countries at the international level was recognized as difficult. The European Communities have developed standards for certification authorities. Canada and the United States have developed accreditation standards for certification authorities. One problem identified is that technical standardization bodies are not always well equipped to understand the policy implications of the standards they are developing.","WTCOMTDM35.pdf","Canada, United, States"
"3396",3396,"146","146.    Technological neutrality of laws is another issue for governments to consider. One of the main problems in developing countries is lack of resources. The more neutral a law is with respect to the technology acceptable, the more the technical standardization body has to deal with. However, the more technology-specific the laws are, the more difficult it is for the regulators to function and the higher the probability that the law may soon become obsolete. Regulations should therefore be technology neutral. There is also a need for cooperation between bodies defining technical standards and the accreditation and licencing bodies within and across countries. The guiding principle for the regulators should be that the technologies should meet the needs of people.","WTCOMTDM35.pdf",""
"3397",3397,"147","147.    Solutions to consumer complaints from e-commerce are also needed. The consumer law in most countries focuses on giving the consumer the possibility to bring the seller to court, rather than on mediation. Alternatives to court proceedings for e-commerce are still open to discussion and debate. Basic alternatives to court proceedings are conciliation, mediation, and arbitration. A voluntary code of conduct could be drafted by the private sector, civil society and the government in cooperation. A first step in a voluntary code of conduct could be a policy on returned goods which could apply to e-commerce just as it applies to ""normal"" commerce. Such a policy would resolve several problems without the need to go through the more advanced forms such as mediation or court proceedings.

"3401",3401,"150","150.    Many felt that an open and liberal approach to information and communication technologies (ICT) and e-commerce could be the right one for development. The promotion of modern information and communication technologies should be a government-wide initiative and should not concern only one Ministry. The governments also need to cooperate with the private sector and there is even some need for cooperation within private sectors, as for example is the case for banks. At the global level, membership of the Information Technology Agreement (ITA) and active participation in the WTO can be useful.

An appropriate legal and regulatory environment can help to attract investment in the infrastructure for modern information and communication technology (ICT). Questions for governments to ask are: How can our existing infrastructure be used and investment attracted? Which types of services will bring the additional benefit that other sectors develop? The legal and regulatory framework should encourage competition, better services and wider availability of ICTs. In some developing countries monopolies are blocking investment, even by local businesses. Governments also need to encourage the development of networks such as the Internet and facilitate for different types of service providers. ICT should be a national priority issue for the government, which itself could use ICT to build confidence, through government procurement for example.","WTCOMTDM35.pdf","ICT, ICT"

If the digital divide is the gap between what is wanted and the actual level, then every country suffers from a human resources digital divide, although it is more acute in developing countries. A key element for the use of e-commerce is to have strong domestic human capacity on technical, legal, policy and regulatory issues. However, all countries seem to experience a lack of people with ICT-related education. Several problems relating to human capacity have therefore been identified, such as digital illiteracy, ICT skills gap (lack of technicians and professionals) and high access costs. An action plan to remedy that situation could contain investment in people and skills, the stimulation of the use of the Internet, and cheaper, faster and more secure access.","WTCOMTDM35.pdf","ICT"
"3406",3406,"155","155.    Investments in people and skills, particularly targetting young people still in school and workers should be objectives for all governments.

Access is cheaper in certain developed countries than in most developing countries, but there is sometimes too little competition in the sector to put enough pressure on prices, which are therefore still kept too high. The aim for one region was to achieve region-wide regulation with competition for each line to each consumer in order to increase access and lower prices.","WTCOMTDM35.pdf",""

Each country and continent could construct an e- balance sheet showing the e-readiness of the country. This balance sheet could contain:         1.      The penetration level of ICT;         2.      Internet accessibility;         3.      Strength of the export-oriented sector;         4.      Strength of the banking sector;         5.      How far away the markets are located;         6.

The broad objective for the government has to be the availability of information technology for everybody, not only for one section of society.

"3414",3414,"162","162.     The idea of setting up an e-commerce task force was welcomed as information technology and e-commerce spans a large number of sectors. A task force might ideally comprise a large number of government departments, as the promotion of modern ICT has to be a government-wide initiative and does not concern only one Ministry. For example, the ministries with responsibilities in the areas of trade, economics, education, transport and telecommunications normally need to be involved. However, a large number of other ministries, such as tourism, might have to be involved depending on the situation of each country. As in session one, many participants emphasized a need for strategic alliances and partnerships between public and private sector entities and also with civil society. CONCLUSIONS","WTCOMTDM35.pdf","Ministry"
"3415",3415,"163","163.    Some of the main lines of thought emerging from the seminar were that:         •       Governments have an important role to play in creating an enabling environment for                 e-commerce. In this way, focus can be placed on digital dividends rather than digital                 divides.         •       The development of physical, legal and human infrastructure, as well as fostering                 confidence are important aspects of that environment.         •       Economic, technical and legal measures are all necessary.         •       Experiences of developing and developed country governments are similar and                 overlap in many respects, but the resource constraints are very different. Both                 developing and developed countries may learn from each other's experience.         •       A strategic government plan on e-commerce is advisable and should be inclusive.         •       Relations among parties change through e-commerce.         •       Governments, private sector and civil society have to work together to build a                 coherent framework for e-commerce.

"3416",3416,"164","164.    A balanced approach integrating government regulation and legislation with business practices and civil society concerns is conceptually the right one. ICT and e-commerce pose challenges for governments which have to rethink how they set the rules for the marketplace to operate. Questions for governments include how to stimulate economic growth associated with the ICT revolution, how to facilitate e-commerce and how to bridge the different digital divides. The Canadian approach is based on a balanced policy framework, including building trust in the digital marketplace through for example consumer protection, clarifying marketplace rules, strengthening the information infrastructure and realizing its benefits.","WTCOMTDM35.pdf","ICT, ICT"
"3417",3417,"165","165.     The challenge is to strike the right balance between government regulation and laissez-faire. E-commerce can not be regulated in the old, classical sense, there has to be co-regulation, i.e. a mixed public/private approach. Barriers to trade can come from overregulation, effectively limiting choices and opportunities in markets as well as from a lack of regulation effectively resulting in commercial and/or national solutions also limiting choices and international harmonization. Current initiatives on which the Canadian Government is working include cryptography, where the Government liberalizes rules and encourages industry-led accreditation of private sector certification authorities. Consumer protection laws with voluntary business guidelines have been drafted by industry, Government and consumer organizations in cooperation. The current focus is on how to operationalize these. The Government felt the need for specific legislation regarding privacy, which it enacted in January 2001. This legislation sets the rules for the collection, use and disclosure of personal information, aiming at balancing the rights of the individual with the needs of commercial organizations. A Ministerial Committee on Taxation has been established with the Government committed to have a technology neutral taxation regime. One e-commerce related bill clarified 200 other pieces of legislation with respect to electronic transactions. Consumer protection is to a large extent based on a voluntary code.","WTCOMTDM35.pdf","Ministerial, Committee, on, Taxation"
"3418",3418,"166","166.     In the international context, a key element to the use of e-commerce is for every country to have a strong domestic human capacity on legal, policy and regulatory issues. The rapid development and diffusion of e-commerce requires a broad collaborate approach by governments, private sector, civil society and international organizations. The role of the government is to meet the public interest in creating an environment for global e-commerce in which the basic rules are appropriate, clear and predictable. Existing unnecessary international legal and regulatory barriers should be eliminated and the emergence of new ones prevented. The priority for both governments and industry is to foster confidence in the instruments and networks of e-commerce. The leading role of the private sector is to simulate the growth of global e-commerce through investments and dynamic innovation in products and services. Civil society must be engaged in efforts to facilitate the growth of e-commerce and maximize its potential in social, civic and community development. International cooperation plays a key role in creating a seamless environment for e-commerce.","WTCOMTDM35.pdf",""
"3419",3419,"167","167.     The future agenda, applicable to any government, is to exert policy leadership. Second generation policy issues to be tackled include technical standards for secure transactions across jurisdictions, market-place principles for industry self-accreditation, the use of broad-band infrastructure, principles and standards governing business to consumer transactions, and codes of practice. The Canadian Government measures the impact of the information technology revolution on society. This will be more systematic with next national survey. What is already clear is that 60 per cent of Canadian e-commerce consumption is from sites in the United States and that e-commerce in Canada seems to bridge the urban-rural divide. It is important to clarify marketplace rules. WT/COMTD/M/35 Page 38 European Communities","WTCOMTDM35.pdf","United, States, Canada"
"3420",3420,"168","168.    The European Communities identified the following problems in its focus on ICT and education:         1.      Digital illiteracy;         2.      ICT skills gap (lack of technicians and professionals);         3.      High access costs.","WTCOMTDM35.pdf","ICT, ICT"

The objectives for all EC member states are for schools to be connected, teachers to be trained, school curricula and educational support services on line to be developed. 94 per cent of schools in the EC have computers. The EC is working on designing a standard diploma for basic information technology skills in cooperation with industry. A network of EC training centres is also being worked on.","WTCOMTDM35.pdf","EC, EC, EC, EC"
"3424",3424,"171","171.     For benchmarking, the EC is first identifying best practices from among the projects already ongoing. The second step is exchanges and cooperation and e-learning weeks across Europe. Third, there is funding both at Member State and Commission level to build infrastructure and develop education certificates and tools on-line. 50 per cent of EC workers use a computer but only 22 per cent of them have any computer-related training and only 6 per cent of workers are using the possibility of telework. ICT research is important, as is finding new ways of teaching. It is necessary to work with the private sector to know what type of skills the industry is looking for. A more competitive telecommunications market is part of any solution, as is inspiring people to use more ICTs. Awareness campaigns and information centers are two initiatives to make people in general acquainted with ICT and learn about the possibilities of e-commerce. The financing of loans to small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs) for e-commerce and ICT in business could constitute additional incentives for private sector use of e-commerce.

The telecommunications market is being opened up to deal with a number of issues such as the lack of bandwidth. On the legal side an e-commerce and information technology act is already in place, based on the UNCITRAL law on e-commerce. The Government of India is in the process of giving licences to certification authorities. The Government is also working on providing its services on-line. Inter and intra-bank transactions are being worked on through a Government secure network. Management is just as important as technology issues.","WTCOMTDM35.pdf","India, UNCITRAL, India, Inter"
"3426",3426,"173","173.     The Government also makes awareness raising and educational efforts. A national task force was created a few years ago with private and public sector participation which resulted in recommendations such as opening up to Internet Service Providers (ISPs) and building the legal environment for electronic transactions. EDIFACT has been declared the standard for messaging. The Government and the industry work together in a pilot project for uniform standards for electronic data interchange.

"3427",3427,"174","174.     Mexico has during the 1990's amended and adapted its laws to promote e-commerce. Mexico's openness in the area during the last year has been an important factor determining the decision to adopt new technologies. More than 14,000 firms in Mexico today use electronic means of transaction, usually EDI (Electronic Data Interchange) and the Internet. The main effort in Mexico began in 1998 with the setting up of a group to develop the first law on e-commerce based on the UNCITRAL model law and studies of the laws of the US, Canada and certain countries of the European Communities. The law was finalized and adopted in 2000. Within the new government, a programme for e-commerce is driven by the Secretariat of Communication and Transport, because of the fundamental role played by infrastructure; it also includes technology and interconnection. Another aspect for the Mexican Government to deal with is administration, including training of personnel and monitoring of e-networks. A third is the legal aspect. Lawyers are currently analyzing different regulations to be promulgated in various fields. The forth aspect is content and programmes where the Secretariat of Economy is involved in close cooperation with Secretariat of Communication and Transport to provide value-added aspects such as health, services, education, and trade. The Secretariat of Economy establishes special programmes for the digital economy aimed at closing the digital divide.","WTCOMTDM35.pdf","Mexico, Mexico, Mexico, Mexico, UNCITRAL, US, Canada, Secretariat, of, Communication, and, Transport, Secretariat, of, Economy, Secretariat, of, Communication, and, Transport, Secretariat"

The Secretariat of Economy also covers the development of the information technology industry such as software production, exports of products and best use of the trade agreements in the area. In addition, the Government of Mexico also tackles the trust-aspect of SMEs. 99 per cent of Mexican firms are small and without the technological means to use e-commerce whereas the larger firms already are doing e-business and have begun to include smaller suppliers. The Government has made an effort to act as an example.","WTCOMTDM35.pdf","Secretariat, of, Economy, Mexico"

The Government is adopting a legal framework on data-retention requirements, and a sectoral ministerial group has been set up which involves all leaders in Mexico in the field.

"3430",3430,"177","177.     The South African approach is similar to the Canadian one. However, South Africa is also very different in one important respect. One part of South Africa belongs to the international community and one part is a developing country. South Africa is two countries in one; a first world country and a least-developed country. This means that the Government of South Africa has certain rights, obligations and responsibilities. There is a dire need for building communications infrastructure overall. The South African Government has to balance the ""two nations"".

A Green Paper was produced which was open to inputs from the public. A Green Paper is normally turned into a White Paper, but that process had to be cut short because of the speed of developments in the area of e-commerce so the Government went straight to the Bill. The main objective of the Bill is universal access. It has been renamed the ""Electronic Communications and Transactions Bill"". Human resource development is another objective. At the top of the main objectives of the Electronic Transactions Bill is the question of development of SMEs and investor access.

The Government of South Africa aims at promoting South Africa as a preferred destination for the use and development of ICT. A clear, stable, predictable environment to facilitate e-commerce is believed important for attracting investment as well. African Heads-of-State have adopted the Millennium Partnership for African Recovery Programme which is a comprehensive programme for the development of Africa.

The Government of Sweden aims at creating enhanced accessibility, skills and confidence in the electronic marketplace which will make people use the new opportunities created by ICTs. The aim is for Sweden to become an information society for everyone. ICTs should be a catalyst for progress and welfare. ICTs create business opportunities. The objectives of the Swedish Government are to coordinate state activities and have a coordinated policy for e-commerce. It therefore concentrates on:          1.     investigating opportunities for, and obstacles to, e-commerce in the areas of the                 different government authorities;          2.     monitoring, mapping and reporting on the impact of e-commerce on Swedish                 companies;          3.     promoting the use of e-commerce in state-owned companies;          4.     ensuring predictable and technology neutral regulations;          5      promoting e-government 24 hours a day, seven days a week.

The growth of Internet and e-commerce presents growth opportunities to developing countries. A study shows a connection between increases in Web-hosts and trade and that the effect on the Internet on trade had been stronger in developing than in developed countries. Increasing Internet access can have positive effects on the exports of developing countries. To achieve that, a focus on institutional infrastructure and innovation is necessary. Institutional issues should be addressed at the local and global levels. It must be a government wide initiative and not only one ministry (the ministries of trade, economics, education, transport and telecommunications normally need to be involved).

"3443",3443,"2","2.      The Director of the Development Division said that there were a number of revisions to the airgram reflecting new developments. First, Item D, on Participation of Developing Countries in World Trade, had been deleted. There were two reasons for that. The first was that the information the Secretariat had been compiling for that paper had been pre-empted by the Director-General's Report on Developments in the Multilateral Trading System, which would be issued before the Fourth Ministerial Conference. That document would contain substantial sections on both the participation of developing countries in international trade, and their participation in WTO activities. The Secretariat had therefore decided to hold off but continued to consider how value could be added to the Director-General's paper later in the year. The second reason was that the developments of the last few months and weeks had changed the economic prospects for developing countries. It was already difficult to ""call"" the changes in the economic scene emerging from the downturn in the US and world economy since late 1999, and that had recently been made even more difficult and more negative, at least in the short run. In those circumstances, it would be pointless to put out a paper now. The Secretariat therefore proposed to issue, if possible by the end of the year, a paper which would complement and if possible update the Director-General's report. The proposed study would bear the tentative title of ""Implications for Developing Countries of Changes in the Structure of World Trade"" and would be factual. It would focus on examining the ways in which the changing product and service composition of world trade impacts on the trading opportunities of developing countries.","WTCOMTDM35.pdf","Director, Development, Division, Secretariat, Director-General, WTO, Secretariat, Director-General, US, Secretariat, Director-General"
"3444",3444,"20","20.      The Chairman said that the CTD had had a number of discussions on special and differential treatment (S&D), both in the context of the work programme of the CTD and in the context of the General Council's work on implementation. The question of operationalisation of special and differential treatment had come up repeatedly, and was discussed in the Secretariat Note (WT/COMTD/W/77/Rev.1). He said that in the CTD's past discussions, he had detected a strong interest by Members in moving forward on the question of special and differential treatment in order to make it more effective. He wondered whether, without prejudice to what Members may decide in                                                                                      WT/COMTD/M/35                                                                                              Page 5 the General Council in relation to implementation and preparations for Fourth Ministerial Conference, Members were prepared to continue in that forward looking spirit and attempt to examine ways in which special and differential treatment could be made more effective and operational. He said the Secretariat Note contained a number of questions which he believed provided a useful framework for discussions, and hoped that Members in their comments would speak to some or all of these.","WTCOMTDM35.pdf","Chairman, CTD, CTD, General, Council, Secretariat, CTD, Members, Members, General, Council, Members, Secretariat, Members"
"3445",3445,"21","21.     The Director of the Development Division introduced document WT/COMTD/W/77/Rev.1 and noted that it was a complete update of the earlier document WT/COMTD/W/77 produced in 2000. He drew the attention of Members to sections II:B and II:C of the paper in particular. Section II:B contained a breakdown of the provisions for special and differential treatment in WTO agreements according to the six different categories that had become common usage in WTO discussions. The section contained a short description of each category of special and differential treatment provisions, as well as a listing of each individual provision that fell into a particular category. Provisions listed in bold indicated those which, in the assessment of the Secretariat, were couched in mandatory language. An analysis was also provided of how the provisions relating to LDCs were broken down in relation to the five other categories. In section II:C, the paper raised a number of questions that might facilitate consideration by members on how provisions for special and differential treatment could be operationalised and enhanced. These questions drew on the information contained in part II:B and part III of the paper. Part III of the paper provided a substantial amount of information on each provision and each agreement, in particular where steps had been taken in Councils and Committees concerning the provisions for special and differential treatment. Information was provided on an agreement-by-agreement basis, including on negotiating proposals presented in the Special Sessions of the Committee on Agriculture and the Council for Trade in Services. He hoped that the document would be a good basis for the discussions that would take place on operationalising S&D provisions in the WTO.","WTCOMTDM35.pdf","Director, Development, Division, Members, WTO, WTO, Secretariat, Committee, on, Agriculture, Council, for, Trade, in, Services, WTO"
"3446",3446,"22","22.      The representative of the United States said that the document was a useful reference for the Committee in its work on special and differential treatment. However, his delegation did not believe that the document reflected adequately the benefits derived by developing country Members already received in areas and agreements discussed by the paper. For example, the paper recorded numerous criticisms of the Generalised System of Preferences (GSP), but did not contain any discussion of its benefits or data on the use of GSP schemes by developing countries. He said the paper should be changed to better reflect the benefits and technical assistance developing countries were already receiving, and recommended that in redrafting the paper, the Secretariat make use of information on the participation of developing countries in international trade, that was currently under preparation.","WTCOMTDM35.pdf","United, States, Committee, Members, Secretariat"
"3447",3447,"23","23.      The representative of the European Communities welcomed the document as a necessary basis for getting to grips with the issue of special and differential treatment, which was being dealt with not only in the CTD, but had gained prominence elsewhere, notably in the implementation debate. He said that Members were looking ahead, although there was no agreement as yet, to continue work on special and differential treatment, be it in the Committee on Trade and Development, a special procedure stemming from the report presented by the Chairman (WT/GC/52), the implementation debate, or a debate on rules, depending on the future work programme of the WTO which he believed would be ambitious. He said that the paper was particularly useful in putting the right questions, and his delegation was intrigued by pages 10 and 11 where a number of good questions had been raised. The discussion that had been held following the request by the Chairman of the General Council in a more pragmatic way already showed that many of the points had come back in the short discussion on the possible mandate of the CTD. He said that it was necessary that the discussion be forward looking, as well as backward looking on the existing provisions. It was understood that there was much discontent with the manner in which special and differential treatment provisions operated, and his delegation agreed that making them more effective and operational was a major objective of the organisation, and one to which his delegation fully subscribed. He said it was interesting to note that, as reflected in part D, part of the debate on special and differential treatment WT/COMTD/M/35 Page 6 was now connected to new negotiations in agriculture and services, and his delegation expected that focus on special and differential treatment to be reflected in any other area which Members might take up in the future. He said that that was not a call for a new round of negotiations, but rather a reminder that it was important to keep in mind the overall objectives. He pointed to the concept of flexibility of commitments, of action, and use of policy instruments, and, referred to GATS Article XVI which showed that flexibility in the agreement was built-in on a case-by-case basis. That was a prime example which showed how the future construction of rules, and future negotiations in agriculture, services and beyond, could look at the architecture of agreements to see how it would be possible to achieve the objectives of the organisation without having excessive recourse to a rules-and-exemption type approach which had characterised the debate to date. WT/COMTD/W/77/Rev.1 was a useful working document. He welcomed the fact that it had the nucleus of a distinction between mandatory and non-mandatory provisions, which had been discussed at length elsewhere. With respect to the discussion on special and differential treatment held in the context of Implementation Tiret 96, his delegation looked forward to further discussions and hoped these would lead to a meaningful decision.","WTCOMTDM35.pdf","European, Communities, CTD, Members, Committee, on, Trade, and, Development, Chairman, WTO, Chairman, General, Council, CTD, Members"

His delegation had then realized that it had not fulfilled the formal requirements and had therefore submitted a notification. He did not wish to see another discussion in the CTD, especially as it would be transferred to the Sub-Committee on Least-Developed Countries.

His delegation thought that the European Communities already granted duty-free access for bananas in the quota. What was mentioned in the notification was duty-free access for the three quotas A,B and C as of 2006. That had neither been agreed to, nor authorized and there was no waiver for it. The waiver and the conditions were to begin to be negotiated in the coming 90 days.

"3463",3463,"38","38.     The Chairman said that a study entitled ""The Generalised System of Preferences: A preliminary analysis of the Generalised System of Preferences Schemes in the Quad"" had been prepared by the Secretariat in response to requests from delegations for further information on the benefits of the Generalized System of Preferences (GSP). He asked the Secretariat to introduce the study.","WTCOMTDM35.pdf","Chairman, Secretariat, Secretariat"
"3464",3464,"39","39.     The Director of the Development Division said that the study was a preliminary analysis of aspects of the GSP schemes of the Quad and did not yet cover other developed country markets. The study had been carried out at the request of the Committee but in response particularly to a request from the delegation of the United States, at the 32nd Session of the CTD, for further information on the WT/COMTD/M/35 Page 8 benefits of the GSP. He realised that Members would not have had time to study the document and therefore wished to hold it on the agenda for a future meeting of the CTD. The aim of the study was to provide an introduction to the functioning of the GSP, including the preferences provided by developed countries and the benefits drawn by developing countries. In practice, what the Secretariat had been able to do in the time available and the material to hand was a limited analysis of the GSP schemes of the Quad. The survey was divided into five parts. After an introductory section, Section II provided an overview of the history and rationale of the GSP system from the earliest days of the Prebisch and Singer academic work till now, relating it to the Enabling Clause provisions of the GATT and raising some points that had been brought up in the WTO context, for example in Trade Policy Reviews. Section III aimed to give a brief description of the main features of the GSP schemes of the Quad, including criteria under which countries might qualify for GSP treatment, rules of origin and some indication of utilisation rates. In preparing the study the Secretariat had used a wide range of material, including useful work done by UNCTAD on utilisation of GSP. Part IV of the study was an attempt to give a consistent statistical analysis of tariff treatment and trade of GSP beneficiaries and other export sources in the Quad countries, MFN or other preferential sources. It showed quite graphically the relative importance of GSP and other preferential sources in the US, Canadian, EC and Japanese markets.","WTCOMTDM35.pdf","Director, Development, Division, GSP, Committee, United, States, CTD, GSP, Members, CTD, GSP, Secretariat, GSP, GSP, Prebisch, GATT, WTO, GSP, Secretariat, UNCTAD, GSP, GSP, MFN, GSP, US, EC"

"3466",3466,"40","40.      He continued by saying that in compiling the statistical analysis the Secretariat had principally used the IDB data base, supplemented in one case by information from UNCTAD's TRAINS data base. In the analysis, trade was categorized by tariff treatment rather than by source, with the aim of avoiding double counting and to make it as clear as possible how far preferential access was being granted and how far the different categories of preferential access were applicable. The rules that had been applied in doing that were spelled out on pages 14 and 16 of the study. Tables 2 to 5 on pages 17 to 24 showed, successively, the value of imports by forms of tariff treatment; the average rates of duty corresponding to the same forms of treatment; the number of tariff lines covered by the various forms of treatment; and the top 20 GSP beneficiaries in each of the Quad members. The data were all for 1999 which was the most recent year for which compatible figures were available. Tables AI and AII completed the statistical analysis presented in Part IV by breaking down the tariff treatment and trade by various preferential categories, including GSP by agricultural products and industrial products. In those areas, the definitions conventionally used in the Uruguay Round defining industrial and agricultural products had been used. Part V of the study raised some questions that the Secretariat believed to be relevant, or possibly worthy of further study. Those were outlined in bold in paragraphs 82, 84, 86, 87, 88, and 90. A suggestion for possible further work on the basis of a modelling approach was made in the final paragraph.","WTCOMTDM35.pdf","Secretariat, IDB, UNCTAD, GSP, GSP, Uruguay, Round, Secretariat"
"3467",3467,"41","41.      The representative of the Secretariat said that one of the lessons that had been learned quite quickly from the research for the study was that, despite the fact that Members had generally made regular notifications of the changes in their GSP schemes, as noted in Annex I, there was no easy way of using the notifications. The fact that the Secretariat had changed the numbering of notifications since the introduction of the WTO incidentally made them easier to track; the GATT references to GSP schemes made in the L-series of documents were far from easy to track. Few notifications, were in electronic form. Few, if any, were formulated in a way that easily showed how changes related to the full structure of the schemes or to their impact. It was therefore difficult to analyse the impact of GSP schemes using the notifications alone. Fortunately, UNCTAD had done some useful work in producing handbooks on individual schemes and the Secretariat had leaned heavily on that work in describing the scheme. One of the most important questions for the utility of the notification process for all Members of the WTO might be to obtain comprehensive notifications on GSP schemes available through electronic means and readily accessible to all Members. He suggested that, in the future, this might be done through links with relevant national websites. If it was agreed, at a later meeting of the CTD, to continue work on the issue, it would also be useful to consider joint research with the UNCTAD Secretariat to look at how data on GSP could be supplied in a compatible way by various Members and to explore what other aspects of GSP schemes could possibly be examined in                                                                                       WT/COMTD/M/35                                                                                               Page 9 the future.

The representative of the Secretariat said that it was difficult to analyze, in practice, whether a Member was using one type of preferential provision or another in access to different markets, particularly the EC market. As a convention in the Secretariat study, when an ACP country could use separate ACP benefits into the EC market, it was assumed that it had done so and had consequently been counted as ACP rather than GSP preference utilisation. However, it was almost impossible to know whether, in practice, a Member such as Kenya had used ACP preferential treatment for some products and GSP treatment for others.","WTCOMTDM35.pdf","Secretariat, Member, EC, Secretariat, EC, GSP, Member, Kenya, ACP, GSP"

The Chairman reported on the Seminar on ""Government Facilitation of E-Commerce for Development"" held on 14 June 2001, under the auspices of the CTD.1 The seminar had been useful. It had been well attended, the presentations were interesting, as were the discussions following each session. The four sessions had covered regulation and deregulation, promotion of modern information and communication technologies, education and information, and government coordination.","WTCOMTDM35.pdf","Chairman, CTD"
"3478",3478,"51","51.    Some of the main lines of thought that had emerged from the seminar were that:         •          Governments have an important role to play in creating an enabling environment for                    e-commerce. In this way, focus can be placed on digital ""dividends"" rather than                    digital ""divides"";         •          A strategic government plan on e-commerce is advisable and should be inclusive;         •          Economic, technical and legal measures are all necessary elements in creating an                    enabling environment;         •          The development of physical, legal and human infrastructure, as well as fostering                    confidence are important aspects of that environment;         •          Experiences of developing and developed country governments are similar and                    overlap in many respects; both developing and developed countries may learn from                    each other's experience. However, the resource availabilities and constraints are very                    different;         •          Relations among parties change through e-commerce; therefore, Governments,                    private sector and civil society have to work together to build a coherent framework                    for e-commerce.","WTCOMTDM35.pdf",""
"3479",3479,"52","52.      The Chairman said that it was important that the proceedings of every seminar fed into the work of the Committee. To a large extent, a seminar was a possibility for Members to deepen their knowledge and get inspiration and ideas. However, the long-term aim was that the ideas would move the work of the Committee, and the overall WTO Work Programme, forward. The seminar had fulfilled this purpose, as it had fed both into the dedicated discussion on cross-cutting issues which had been held under the auspices of the General Council on the following day, and into the later informal consultation on a programme of work on electronic commerce in the CTD.","WTCOMTDM35.pdf","Chairman, Committee, Members, Committee, WTO, Work, Programme, General, Council, CTD"

"3481",3481,"54","54.     The Chairman said that a draft programme of work on e-commerce for the CTD had been discussed at an informal meeting on 17 July 2001. A revised version, taking into account suggestions by delegations at that meeting was now before the Committee in document WT/COMTD/W/92. The document outlined work the Committee might pursue in respect of the development implications of e-commerce and suggested the format such work could take.

The representative of the United States said that the overall WTO Work Programme on Electronic Commerce was being considered in the preparations for the Fourth Ministerial Conference.

"3483",3483,"56","56.      The representative of Canada welcomed the initiative of the proposed Work Programme in the CTD and could agree to the elements contained therein. However, Ministers would consider the issue of electronic commerce at the Fourth Ministerial Meeting and would then instruct the General Council on the direction of future work to be undertaken on electronic commerce in the WTO. Whatever was done with the CTD Work Programme at this meeting it was crucial that it was without prejudice to decisions taken at the Fourth Ministerial Conference or subsequently by the General Council. With respect to paragraph 6 of the CTD Work Programme, his delegation fully endorsed the utility of interaction and linkages between the WTO and other international organizations. The CTD should continue to cooperate with other organizations on specifically development related issues of e-commerce.","WTCOMTDM35.pdf","Canada, Work, Programme, CTD, General, Council, WTO, CTD, Work, Programme, General, Council, CTD, Work, Programme, WTO, CTD"

The Chairman recalled that the CTD was the WTO focal point for the United Nations (UN) Conference on Financing for Development (FFD) and that WTO Members had sent a contribution to the Preparatory Committee of the International Conference on Financing for Development (document WT/COMTD/30). He invited the Secretariat to brief the Committee on the process.","WTCOMTDM35.pdf","Chairman, CTD, WTO, United, Nations, UN, WTO, Members, Preparatory, Committee, International, Conference, on, Financing, for, Development, Secretariat, Committee"
"3489",3489,"61","61.     The Director of the Development Division said that, as Members knew, the UN was planning a major Conference on Financing for Development between 18 and 22 March 2002 (the Conference). That Conference would be held in Monterrey, Mexico. A Preparatory Committee (Prep Com), currently co-chaired by the Canadian and Thai Ambassadors in New York, had been working on preparing the Conference, which was originally to have been held in 2001, but was postponed to 2002. The Committee was reminded and asked to note, that at its last meeting it had been informed of the WTO's attendance at the last Prep Com. The Prep Com had met three times so far. Its next meeting was in the week of 15 October, with the main discussion focussing on a ""Draft Outcome"" document which was being prepared by a Facilitator - Dr. Mauricio Escanero of Mexico - who had been appointed by the Prep Com. Copies of the Draft Outcome were available in the meeting room, and the WTO Secretariat was going to the Prep Com meeting the following week to listen to the discussion, to be able to report on the outcome of the discussions of the ""Draft Outcome"".

"3490",3490,"62","62.     The context of the Conference's work was the role of financing for development in achieving the aims set out in the UN's Millennium Declaration as the International Development Goals for 2015. The Conference would have three segments: a High-Level Officials' meeting, a Ministerial segment where governments would be invited to send fully integrated delegations with representatives from all relevant national Ministries, and a Summit segment. The Conference would take up six main themes: domestic resource mobilization in developing countries; the role of private capital flows; the role of trade; the role of international development cooperation, including the ODA; and a series of ""systemic issues"" relating to the framework of international cooperation on economic, financial and developmental questions. All relevant information and documentation concerning the Conference could be found on the interactive website http://www.un.org/esa/ffd.","WTCOMTDM35.pdf","UN, ODA"
"3491",3491,"63","63.      The representative of the Secretariat went on to explain that page 1 of the ""Draft Outcome"" set out seven broad principles to which it recommended that the nations commit themselves: equity, solidarity, co-responsibility, foresight, participation, ownership and partnership. With respect to trade-related issues, page 4 of the Draft Outcome discusses international trade as an engine for growth and development. The Draft Outcome, on trade-related issues makes the following points:         •       Trade liberalization would substantially contribute to achieve development of world                 wide; trade barriers and subsidies in developed countries – which currently impose                 costs on developing countries that significantly exceed aid flows – must be                 eliminated. The multilateral trading system must decisively benefit all developing                 countries and countries in transition.         •       Lifting of trade barriers should not be followed by the introduction of new ones;         •       Labour and environmental concerns should be pursued as separate goals through the                 appropriate institutions and fora;         •       World trade should support development goals including by securing full                 implementation of commitments made by developed countries in the Uruguay Round;         •       Enhancing the role of regional and subregional agreements and free trade areas, could                 be a role in providing building blocks for the construction of a better global trading                 system;         •       All industrial countries that have not already done so, should take steps to liberalize                 all imports except arms from LDCs;         •       Multilateral, financial and development institutions should devise ways to stabilize                 the export revenue of developing countries that still depend heavily on commodity                 exports; and         •       Multilateral and bilateral financial and development institutions should deepen their                 support for efforts by developing countries to remove supply-side constraints and                 improve their trade infrastructure.","WTCOMTDM35.pdf","Secretariat, Uruguay, Round"
"3492",3492,"64","64.     The afore-mentioned points were proposals prepared by the Facilitator for consideration in the following week's Prep Com meeting, at which the WTO would be present as a participant observer, along with participants, who were essentially the same as those of the WTO membership. It was suggested that delegations could use the ""Draft Outcome"" in giving advice and instructions to the participant members in the upcoming Prep Com meeting.

"3493",3493,"65","65.     The representative of the Secretariat then drew the Committee's attention to the report of a High-level Panel, appointed by the UN Secretary-General and headed by former President Zedillo of Mexico. The report had been presented to the General Assembly in June 2001. English-language copies of the Executive Summary of the Panel's report were made available in the room and the full 70 page report could be downloaded from the FFD website. The WTO was involved at Secretariat and Membership levels in the FFD process. At the same time, WTO Members' own Ministerial process was currently taking priority in the work of WTO Members. WTO Members could therefore probably not make any substantial input at the moment as the preparations for the Forth WTO Ministerial Conference was ongoing. The outcome of the Ministerial Meeting would undoubtedly be an input into the UN process. He hoped that the WTO would be able to make a positive contribution to the Monterrey Conference.","WTCOMTDM35.pdf","Secretariat, Committee, UN, Zedillo, Mexico, General, Assembly, WTO, Secretariat, WTO, Members, WTO, Members, WTO, Members, WTO, UN, WTO"
"3494",3494,"66","66.     The representative of the European Communities said that his delegation had followed the process closely and that there had been a large number of discussions in the CTD to produce the Members' input. His delegation was unsure about how much of the valuable and difficult work WTO Members had carried out that had been taken into account in the various papers from the Preparatory Committee. However, the recent report by the Facilitator and the Zedillo Panel seemed to have taken some of it into account. He asked how the members of the WTO Secretariat who would continue to participate in the process would address those issues. He also asked whether they would come back to the paper, which had been partly reflected, but on export subsidies for example there were stronger language in the report from the FFD process that WTO Members would not sign up to. The CTD was the focal point within the WTO, but he was not clear as to what the CTD could do more than to take note of reports. He asked if CTD Members were of the view that the CTD should do more, such as for example go through the papers emerging from the FFD process in more detail and what they thought a useful role for the WTO could be. To only produce one paper as an input and then withdraw would not fulfill the role the WTO should play.","WTCOMTDM35.pdf","European, Communities, CTD, Members, WTO, Members, Preparatory, Committee, Zedillo, Panel, WTO, Secretariat, WTO, Members, CTD, WTO, CTD, CTD, Members, CTD, WTO, WTO"
"3495",3495,"67","67.      The representative of the Secretariat said that when he had last participated in a meeting of the Preparatory Committee, the CTD had just managed to produce a consensus document. As he had reported back to the CTD, he had brought that document with him to the meeting of the Preparatory Committee. It had been well received but as it had just been put before the Preparatory Committee there had not been any substantial discussion of it at that meeting. Since then, the Zedillo report and the Facilitator's report had been issued which touched on a large number of topics on which the WTO Membership might have views. WTO Members might deal with the issue directly in New York depending on how the interaction between their Geneva-based and New York-based missions worked. WTO Members could ensure that their representatives in New York expressed the same views on the Facilitator's report, which would be the main topic at the upcoming meeting of the Preparatory Committee, as WTO Members expressed in Geneva, particularly on the two areas of the report dealing with international trade and the section on systemic issues in so far as it touched the WTO. The WTO Secretariat would be represented by Deputy Director-General, Mr. Ouedraogo, at the meeting of the Preparatory Committee and he would point out that the Facilitator's Report had not been fully reviewed in the WTO and that WTO Members would have different views on different topics. The text was the proposal of the Facilitator. It would not be easy for the WTO Membership to express firm views on the FFD documents at this stage, apart from saying that the Facilitator's report was interesting but still controversial. The WTO Membership might be in a better position, after the Fourth Ministerial Conference, to make a full input into the next stage of the preparatory process, which would be in January 2002. The CTD could, if noted, hold an intensive meeting on the FFD process after the Ministerial Conference.","WTCOMTDM35.pdf","Secretariat, Preparatory, Committee, CTD, CTD, Preparatory, Committee, Preparatory, Committee, Zedillo, WTO, WTO, Members, New, York, WTO, Members, New, York, Preparatory, Committee, WTO, Members, Geneva, WTO, WTO, Secretariat, Director-General, Ouedraogo, Preparatory, Committee, WTO, WTO, Members, WTO, WTO, CTD"

He had carried out some informal consultations on those requests, and he regretted to inform the Committee that it appeared that there was not yet consensus on those requests.

The Deputy Director-General, Mr. Ravier, said that, at the May meeting of the CTD, he had hoped to be able to present a new technical cooperation strategy and a revised plan of action in October. He was happy that the deadlines had been met. He said that he would introduce the new documents and give the state of preparations for the current year and the outlook for 2002. In introducing the New WTO Strategy for WTO Techncial Cooperation he would focus on five specific issues:         (a)     The importance of technical assistance and capacity-building;         (b)     Sources of inputs into the Strategy, (document WT/COMTD/W/90);         (c)     The structure of the Strategy document;         (d)     Coordinated WTO Secretariat Annual Technical Assistance Plan for 2001-2002,                 (WT/COMTD/W/90/Add.1); and,         (e)     Procedures for the consideration of the Strategy.","WTCOMTDM35.pdf","Director-General, Ravier, CTD, WTO, WTO, Techncial, Cooperation, WTO, Secretariat"
"3500",3500,"71","71.      First, on the importance of technical assistance and capacity building, he said that one of the core issues that had stood out in the preparatory exercise for the Fourth Ministerial Conference was the vital importance of technical cooperation and capacity building. That had been emphasised by all Members, particularly developing countries, LDCs, small and vulnerable economies, as well as economies in transition. It had been a central element in many regional preparatory meetings for the Fourth Ministerial Conference organized by developing countries and LDCs. It had been linked to implementation of WTO rights and obligations, developing countries' ability to exercise their rights, and ability to draw on the benefits of the open, rules-based multilateral trading system. Evidence for that abounded in the various declarations that had been circulated as WTO Working documents. Technical cooperation and capacity building had to be taken seriously.","WTCOMTDM35.pdf","Members, Fourth, Ministerial, Conference, WTO, WTO"
"3501",3501,"72","72.      Second, on sources of inputs for drafting the New Strategy he said that in drafting the New Strategy, the Secretariat had relied on several sources. First, it had drawn on the many comments made by Members in the CTD. Second, it had reviewed comments in the Sub-Committee on Least- Developed Countries. Third, valuable comments had been taken from the contributions by Members in the process of reviewing the IF. Fourth, the records of the General Council had proved useful with regard to comments made by Members, including in the context of implementation. Fifth, the Secretariat had taken into account the comments made in the on-going preparatory exercise for the Ministerial, both in the two rounds of consultations under bullet 6 of the Chairman's Checklist of 20 April 2001, and in the comments by delegations at the 30-31 July 2001 Reality Check. Finally, he knew that the Director of the Technical Cooperation Division had consulted extensively with individual delegations. The Secretariat had reviewed the records of statements and contributions on                                                                                     WT/COMTD/M/35                                                                                            Page 15 technical cooperation extensively. It had listened carefully, and he believed that the Secretariat had learned.

"3502",3502,"73","73.     Third, the structure of the New Strategy document was simple and divided into four Sections and eight Annexes.         Section I: set out the objectives;         Section II: referred to several of the various approaches that had been suggested by         Members;         Section III: identified ten elements that should be at the core of any optimal strategy         for WTO technical cooperation. That section was the centrepiece of the New         Strategy;         Section IV: described the new structure and the re-organization of the Technical         Cooperation Division. That section referred to the format of the new plan for the         delivery of technical assistance, which would operate on a 12-month basis. The         re-configured format was contained in document WT/COMTD/W/90/Add.1; and,         Annexes V-VIII: defined specific WTO technical assistance policy/strategy for         beneficiary regions and for the area of Information Technology/WTO Reference         Centres. The value of that section was that it related the broad strategy to region-         specific needs and priorities.","WTCOMTDM35.pdf","Members, WTO, WTO"
"3503",3503,"74","74.     Fourth, there was a new structure for the Coordinated WTO Secretariat Annual Technical Assistance Plan, as contained in WT/COMTD/W/90/Add.1.

In the period under review, some 30 activities originally planned for the year 2001 had been postponed to 2002 for a variety of reasons. In some instances, for security considerations, in others, at the request of beneficiary countries. Although that plan contained entries for the year 2002, it was not the Plan for the next year. The entries for 2002 referred to those activities that had been deferred because of overriding circumstances and activities that had been linked to follow-up from 2001. These activities would also appear in the Plan for 2002, to be finalized in the second week of December 2001.","WTCOMTDM35.pdf","WTO, Technical, Cooperation"

In light of the extensive informal consultations held on the Strategy and the comprehensive WT/COMTD/M/35 Page 16 use of inputs from the Membership, he suggested that Members commented and offered guidance on the New Strategy. He further suggested that the Chairman, after interventions by delegations, would propose the CTD to take note of the new Strategy, on the explicit understanding that the Secretariat, in implementing the new Strategy, would be guided by the comments made and guidance offered at the meeting, which should also be in the formal records. Paragraph 20 of the Strategy stated that subsequent revisions of the Strategy would be undertaken at the periodic annual reviews. In proceeding in that way, the CTD would support the efforts underway at the informal sessions of the General Council with regard to the paragraph on technical assistance in the draft Ministerial Declaration.","WTCOMTDM35.pdf","Members, Chairman, CTD, Secretariat, CTD, General, Council"

"3507",3507,"78","78.      The representative of Lesotho said that, his delegation fully shared the view expressed by the Deputy Director-General in his introductory remarks that technical assistance had emerged within the current series of consultations in preparation for the Fourth Ministerial Conference as the most central issue in all discussions. His delegation too, considered technical assistance and capacity building central to current and future work in this organization. He said he wished to make some specific comments on the Strategy, in particular its core elements. On technical assistance as a mechanism for mainstreaming, he supported the view that technical assistance could only be made effective if implemented in concert with other elements of a country's development strategy. However for the mainstreaming strategy to be effective it was imperative that the overall strategy which, in that case was the World Bank/IMF Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP) process made adequate provision for the role to be played by trade policy. From his country's experience the present guidelines on preparations of PRSPs were not clear, and as a consequence, the resulting PRSPs were weak on trade policy issues. He was aware that that issue would need to be raised again during the meeting of the Sub-Committee on Least-Developed Countries. His delegation agreed with the call for efforts to be intensified to address the issue of coherence between government ministries. Perhaps, one practical way the WTO could assist would be for the Trade Policy Review Division to undertake an assessment of the degree of coherence between ministries in developing countries, and in LDCs specifically, as part of the overall preparation for a review.","WTCOMTDM35.pdf","Lesotho, Director-General, WTO, Trade, Policy, Review, Division"
"3508",3508,"79","79.      He continued by saying that his delegation had been actively involved in the work to revamp the IF, and continued to be closely involved in its implementation. His only comment was that it was important to bear in mind that mainstreaming could not be achieved through the PRSP process alone. That was important to Members who were not PRSP countries and therefore efforts should be made to ensure that the framework was supportive of other initiatives being pursued by LDCs. His delegation was of the view that Integrated National Plans for WTO implementation were important and warranted full attention. The current discussions in the General Council on Implementation-related issues bore testimony to that point. Furthermore, while he did agree that there was a need to improve coherence between national institutions, he also believed that it was equally critical for the WTO Secretariat to improve its approach to delivery of technical assistance. By that he referred specifically to the quality of the missions undertaken by the WTO Secretariat. The experience of his Government had been that the Secretariat concentrated more on reading out the legal texts than on actually outlining the practicalities of the WTO Agreements. The main problem for his country was not to understand the legal text but to acquire the ability to relate WTO agreements to real life situations on the ground. With respect to bilateral donors, he supported the view expressed in the Strategy document that effective co-ordination was the key. To that end his delegation was actively involved in the work of the IF Steering Committee. It was important to underscore the importance his Government attached to the relationship it had with its bilateral partners. Regarding coordination, his delegation welcomed the creation of the Techncial Assistance Management Committee which had                                                                                      WT/COMTD/M/35                                                                                             Page 17 been set up in the WTO Secretariat. As far as auditing, monitoring and evaluation was concerned he considered it to be among the most critical elements of the Strategy and urged the Director-General to institutionalise its operation as early as possible. However, it was equally important that the channels for feedback from recipient countries were maintained and taken into account when conducting audits on the effectiveness of WTO technical assistance. Regarding funding, his delegation was of the view that it was critical to the successful implementation of the Strategy. It was a well-known fact that the ineffectiveness of past strategies was partly a result of the inadequate availability of predictable funding. As delegations moved towards the Fourth Ministerial Conference, they would be judging the commitment of their trading partners on the reaction to the proposal tabled requesting an increase in the regular budget of the WTO for Technical assistance. In conclusion, he pointed out that while his delegation welcomed the recent administrative restructuring of the WTO Secretariat, he hoped that the attention that had been directed at LDCs would not be eroded and that LDCs would continue to be a priority in the technical assistance activities of the WTO Secretariat. He had a question with respect to Section V of the Coordinated WTO Plan for Technical Assistance Activities, on the IF. He asked how the countries listed there had been selected and whether the selection had been made on the basis of the time frame prepared by the IF Steering Committee. The reason why he was posing that question was that his delegation had submitted a request for a national seminar a long time ago. If the Plan was the one for the year 2002, it meant that his request would only be met in 2003. If that was not the case, he sought guidance as to how it could be undertaken.","WTCOMTDM35.pdf","Members, WTO, General, Council, WTO, Secretariat, WTO, Secretariat, Secretariat, WTO, WTO, IF, Steering, Committee, Techncial, Assistance, Management, Committee, WTO, Secretariat, Director-General, WTO, WTO, WTO, Secretariat, WTO, Secretariat, Committee"
"3509",3509,"8","8.     The representative of Egypt said that there had been some developments and his delegation was hopeful that the four requests could be agreed to, on an ad-hoc basis, for the next meeting of the CTD.","WTCOMTDM35.pdf","Egypt, CTD"
"3510",3510,"80","80.      The representative of Zambia said that the new Strategy aimed at charting a new path for WTO technical assistance which would emphasize capacity building. That was a welcome change as WTO technical assistance had been mostly about conforming to the rules. While the objective was good, the proposed means still conveyed the conventional WTO approach. His delegation's comments were meant to assist the Secretariat improve the thrust of the Strategy. They were meant to be constructive and although they might be rough, they were not meant as unproductive criticism. His comments were preliminary as he intended to submit a refined paper to the Secretariat. As stated in the Preamble to the Marrakech Declaration, the over-riding goal of the Multilateral Trading System (MTS) was to promote, through trade, the sustainable development of all countries, for them to participate in, and benefit from, the global creation of wealth and its equitable distribution. Furthermore in recognition of the fact that not all the world's nations were in a position immediately to participate equally in global trading system, the preamble called for the design of positive efforts to ensure that developing countries, particularly the least-developed, secure a share in the growth of international trade commensurate with the needs of their economic development. The need for positive efforts for developing countries to address their particular needs as a necessary element in their effective participation was given expression in the principles of special and differential treatment in the Uruguay Round Agreements.","WTCOMTDM35.pdf","Zambia, WTO, WTO, WTO, Secretariat, Secretariat, Uruguay"
"3511",3511,"81","81.      He went on to say that, over the past six year's life span of the WTO, developing countries and LDCs had experienced increasing marginalization. While that was related to structural economic difficulties in those countries themselves, it was recognised that a significant factor had to do with difficulties in relation to Uruguay Round Agreements. Fundamentally, these were problems related to the imbalances in the Agreements; the undermining of their rights by the other members of the WTO who had failed to live up to their commitments; the negative implications and impacts of some agreements on their economies; and the inadequate capacity to participate in shaping the processes, agenda and rules of the WTO. It was the inability to respond to those difficulties that defined the capacity needs of developing country members of the WTO, and should provide the framework for the technical co-operation Strategy designed to enable those countries participate fully and meaningfully in the MTS.","WTCOMTDM35.pdf","WTO, LDCs, Uruguay, WTO, WTO, WTO"
"3512",3512,"82","82.      With respect to the inadequacies of the Strategy Document he said that while the New Strategy had a lot to be commended for, it suffered from a one-sided focus on the promotion of trade liberalisation and reform as the strategic aim of technical co-operation. For instance, paragraph 1 of WT/COMTD/M/35 Page 18 the Strategy Document stated that ""the core mandate of the WTO was trade liberalisation"". It continued: ""trade liberalisation and reform yield essential development dividends."" On that basis, the purpose of technical assistance was defined as providing ""enabling assistance for Members to undertake trade liberalisation"". Secretariat saw its function as support to ""Members/Observers to assist them understand WTO rules and disciplines, the obligations of Membership, and in building institutional capacity for trade policy"". Not only did that not pay sufficient attention to the vision in the Marrakech Agreement whereby the liberalisation of trade was placed in the context of, and served as one instrument of sustainable development, requiring positive efforts for developing countries to meet their particular economic developmental needs. The one-sided focus on trade liberalisation as the core mandate of the WTO within which the technical co-operation Strategy was premised was limited in a number of ways. Firstly, that the primary orientation of the Strategy Document was towards simply assisting developing countries to better understand and act within the existing agreements, with their rights and obligations. Secondly, where there was effort to place it in a wider context, the context was that of trade liberalisation and reform. Thirdly, those two concerns would seem to shape the interpretation that the Strategy Document placed on all the practical elements of technical co-operation, including such items as policy coherence, and co-operation with other institutions and stake holders and mainstreaming trade policy in national development policy. For instance footnote 5 on page 3 described a MoU between the WTO Secretariat and WIPO for assistance to LDCs on TRIPS. However, it appeared from the note that the main purpose of the memorandum was to assist ""LDC to implement their obligations under the TRIPS Agreement, which fall due in 2006"". LDCs and other developing country members had indicated that part of the problem of implementing TRIPS had to do both with the imbalances in that agreement, as well with the implications for their developmental priorities, and had been seeking a review of that Agreement. That strategic orientation of the Strategy Document was inadequate, and would not assist developing countries to effectively address, in a comprehensive manner, the obstacles they faced with full and meaningful participation in the MTS. For that, technical co-operation needed to have a more holistic orientation.","WTCOMTDM35.pdf","New, Strategy, WTO, Members, Secretariat, WTO, WTO, WTO, Secretariat, WIPO, LDCs"
"3513",3513,"83","83.      He continued by referring to what his delegation saw as strategic aims and objectives. Informed by the developmental visions stated in the Marrakech Declaration, as well as by the experiences of the developing and LDCs, an appropriate strategy of technical assistance should aim to enable those countries to make the MTS respond to their needs. While assisting the countries to activate their rights and live up to their commitments under the existing rules, it also had to enable them identify the elements of the existing agreements which acted as obstacles in meeting their specific economic developmental needs (including, but not limited to, problems of market access, the destruction of domestic production and national productive capacity, food security, etc) and assist them in formulating proposals, and actions for dealing with these difficulties. Equally importantly, it had to be recognised that for the MTS to be sensitive to the specific and often peculiar development problems of developing countries, it was necessary that the developing countries themselves had the ability, above all the political autonomy and space, to identify their developmental needs and strategy, nationally and regionally, in response to those needs. That could be expressed appropriately in the rules and agreements of the MTS. Technical assistance had to be designed to facilitate, rather than crowd out those national processes of formulating trade policy on the basis of national development needs. The objectives of technical assistance should therefore include: (a)     assisting beneficiary countries to understand WTO rules and disciplines, strengthen their         capacity to implement multilateral trade agreements so as to exercise their rights under the         agreements, identify elements of existing agreements and proposals for further agreements         which act as obstacles in meeting their economic developmental needs so as to enable them to         formulate proposals and undertake actions to address them; and exploit the benefits and         opportunities;                                                                                     WT/COMTD/M/35                                                                                            Page 19 (b)     increasing the participation and negotiating capacity in regional trade agreements in a way         that is consistent with their development priorities and options; (c)     enhancing national capacity in the private sector, civil society and research and training         institutions and other national stakeholders to enable them to participate in the formulation         and implementation of trade policies; (d)     ensuring that the WTO worked jointly with other inter-governmental institutions, and         international and regional, as well as national stakeholders in order to ensure that technical         assistance is coherent with national developmental priorities. Trade policy coherence was, in         that regard, not simply coherence among inter-governmental institutions, but based on         identified development options and priorities within a national development strategy. Those         objectives were both additional to, and sharpened the focus of, the objectives listed in the         Strategy Document; (e)     developing countries had to have access to the WTO and be able to participate adequately in         the formulation of trade rules that imposed benefits and obligations on all Members. A         number of LDCs were non-resident members of the WTO, and many of those who were         present, were inadequately represented. He asked how, for example, non-resident members         were represented in the Strategy document in terms of inputs to it and how they could claim         ownership of it.","WTCOMTDM35.pdf","MTS, MTS, MTS, WTO, WTO, WTO, Members, LDCs, WTO"
"3514",3514,"84","84.     He went on to speak about the setting of trade policy as an element of a national development strategy and plan. In terms of the content, the Strategy Document made constant reference to the need to mainstream trade within national development. The meaning of that concept was ambiguous, and the usage tended to suggest that national development had to be formulated in the light of the multilateral trade regime. While there was a virtuous cycle between trade and development, it was clear that, in the current context of most developing countries, the role of trade in economic development and poverty reduction was related to its contribution to the development of national productive capacity. To play that role, trade policy had to reflect and contribute to the realisation of national plans for development and poverty reduction. Technical co-operation had to reflect that relationship. As regarded the process, it meant that WTO technical assistance ""as a mechanism for mainstreaming trade"" needed to go beyond co-ordination among government departments. Such co- ordination had to be part of a dialogue among government, and national stakeholders, including the private sector and governments. The Strategy also had to state clearly that it was the beneficiary countries that should set the objectives and determine the mainstreaming of trade into developmental policies. Developing countries should not have to feel that the Strategy was imposed on them from outside. Therefore, the issue of ownership was primordial, and had to be recognised and stated clearly in the Strategy document. That dialogue also had to extend to co-ordination among intergovernmental agencies; in particular those key ones involved in the IF. The complementarity between the WTO and other international organisations, based on their respective comparative advantage, had to be made visible and effective not only in the execution of technical co-operation activities, but also in their design. Usually, the participation of other organisations was introduced late, when the activities or the programs had already been conceived and sometimes launched. For instance, the draft rightly mentioned the importance of achieving a ""link between appropriate trade policies and development needs"". The most natural complementarity was the one between the WTO, UNCTAD and ITC, that was already implemented in some projects in the field, but could be further enhanced and improved. He noted that there was no reference to the technical co-operation role of ITC, which was a subsidiary of the WTO. Although the competence of ITC was not directly related to policy issues, ITC had an important role to play in terms of supply capacity, hence, the need for the Strategy document to mention co-operation with that organisation. In the new drive to develop capacity building, a necessary component was collaboration with other agencies like UNCTAD and ITC to address the various interrelated dimensions of technical assistance. In that regard, the Joint Integrated Technical WT/COMTD/M/35 Page 20 Assistance Programme for Selected African and Least-Developed Countries (JITAP) was missing in the Strategy document. JITAP was an innovative example in that respect and a model that could be used. He asked how JITAP was envisaged to contribute to the Strategy and what its place in the Strategy was. Complementarity should also extend to the linkages between UNCTAD and the Convention on Biological Diversity (BCD) in the context of TRIPS as they had comparative advantages in the area of bringing out more strongly the developmental needs. The over-riding goal of complementarity had to be to ensure appropriate policies that effectively worked in the development interests of developing countries and which did not restrict the range of their development options and policies. Moving on from complementarity to flexibility he said that it was important to achieve a good conciliation between the three approaches mentioned in the draft. If not well managed, they might become contradictory. In other words, the ownership and the demand- driven approach were key. There was a need to set priorities in a multi-year plan. The evolving trade agenda also required flexibility. According to his delegation, flexibility was to take into account changes in the subjects covered by technical assistance.","WTCOMTDM35.pdf","WTO, WTO, WTO, UNCTAD, ITC, ITC, WTO, ITC, ITC, UNCTAD, ITC, Joint, Integrated, Technical, WT/COMTD/M, Assistance, Programme, UNCTAD"
"3515",3515,"85","85.      He went on to say that the regional dimension of the WTO technical assistance Strategy should be a priority. The support that the WTO could provide, particularly to the regional secretariats of integration schemes of developing countries, needed to be reviewed and expanded. Ideas such as ownership and complementarity might remain empty words if links with regional institutions were not seriously taken into account. For many developing countries, the formulation of trade policies at the regional level was as important as the participation in the MTS. Regarding the autonomous efforts of capacity building by governments, he said that given the diversity of issues and interests that had to be involved and mobilised at the national level for appropriate national development-oriented trade policy formulation for participation in the global system, the capacity building delivered should not crowd out, but endorse and encourage other capacity-building initiatives undertaken by governments, private sector and civil society. While the WTO Secretariat had a key role to play in the delivery of technical assistance and capacity building, it had to work together with other inter-governmental institutions with a tradition in trade and development. Above all, the WTO Secretariat had to play its role in consultation and association with all stakeholders at the national level, and with appropriate bodies at the regional level. To that end, the role of the WTO Secretariat could be to adopt methods and instruments, which enabled it to work in association with other bodies to deliver technical assistance, especially, at the national level. Finally, with respect to strategic targets and developmental goals, he said that the delivery of technical co-operation had to be guided by strategic targets, defined in relation to the identified development interests, goals and priorities, especially of LDCs, to be met by trade instruments and policies. His delegation would make a submission to the Secretariat which he hoped would be helpful, especially as it came from one of the main beneficiaries of WTO technical assistance.","WTCOMTDM35.pdf","WTO, WTO, WTO, Secretariat, WTO, Secretariat, WTO, Secretariat, Secretariat, WTO"
"3516",3516,"86","86.      The representative of Canada said that her delegation thought the document really was a strategic paper. It was not perfect and might require some further work along the lines suggested by the representative of Zambia. However, it had properly situated WTO activities within the context of national development plans, which was critical, and in collaboration with multilateral and bilateral donors' assistance strategies. The WTO could not undertake everything with respect to trade-related capacity building. It was a critical player, but it was one of many. The Strategy attempted to prioritise as to what would be addressed first. LDCs, African countries, non-residents, and modest and capacity-constrained missions were the focus of the Strategy. Her delegation also noted that there was a focus on effective cooperation recognizing that ad-hoc interventions did not have a lasting impact. That was something which had been raised by several delegations in previous sessions of the CTD and she noted that it had been taken into consideration. Her delegation's preference was to increase the WTO technical assistance budget rather than voluntary contributions to a centralized global trust fund. However, as that might not be immediately possible, her delegation recommended that consideration be given to a methodology to maximize the benefits of the many different trust funds. The Budget Committee could be tasked with looking at how to ensure that there was ongoing                                                                                    WT/COMTD/M/35                                                                                           Page 21 access to the financing required to deliver on the plan. In general, her delegation endorsed the Strategy.","WTCOMTDM35.pdf","Canada, Zambia, WTO, WTO, LDCs, CTD, WTO, Budget, Committee"
"3517",3517,"87","87.     The representative of Switzerland said that his delegation basically agreed with the approach presented in the paper. The paper gave a comprehensive view integrating all areas and divisions dealing with technical assistance in the WTO and all actors involved its the delivery of technical assistance. The paper outlined a process-oriented approach which could eventually replace the current approach dominated to a large extent by ad-hoc requests. Crucial elements for the working of the Strategy would be the functioning of national contact points, who first had to be committed to elaborating integrated national plans for implementing the WTO Agreements, and secondly had to be committed to take the idea of mainstreaming seriously. While the Strategy was good in theory it was not clear how it would be implemented in practice. One question related to whether there would be some kind of implementation plan on how to evolve in direction of the mainstreaming process. Another was whether there would be any kind of sequencing, for example to start the implementation with a number of pilot countries, or regions only. A third question was whether there were any concrete plans with regard to coordination with the donors. A more general question related to the next steps, after the document had been taken note of, with a view to put the Strategy into practice.","WTCOMTDM35.pdf","Switzerland, WTO, WTO"
"3518",3518,"88","88.      The representative of the United States said that the new Strategy was useful in the efforts to increase the effectiveness of technical cooperation through coordination with bilateral and multilateral development partners. While his delegation was opposed to more funding out of the regular budget, his delegation had heard the issue of predictability and had done much on technical assistance with funding to the IF Trust Fund, the WTO Global Trust Fund and Africa Initiative Funds to the WTO directly. His delegation encouraged the WTO Secretariat to focus on the Agreement by Agreement approach to technical cooperation and capacity building as it was where the WTO had a well- established comparative advantage. Regarding the Coordinated WTO Plan for Technical Assistance, he said that it could increase the effectiveness of WTO technical assistance and coordination with bilateral and multilateral development partners. He encouraged the Secretariat to see that the Plan was given as wide a distribution as possible.","WTCOMTDM35.pdf","United, States, WTO, WTO, WTO, Secretariat, WTO, WTO, WTO, Secretariat"
"3519",3519,"89","89.      The representative of European Communities said that it was easier to criticize a strategy than to draw one up. Work on the Strategy had been ongoing for a year and that his delegation had been active in the debate and fed in ideas, not only because they were major donors in the field, but because they believed that they would be even more so if there was a coherent strategy. If EC member states had to convince their Finance Ministries to contribute even more money to technical assistance to trade-related matters, within or outside WTO, a coherent strategy in the WTO was part of the evidence that had to be brought forward to convince them. Following an intensive debate internally, the EC had no opposition to take note of the Strategy and use it as a basis for further work. Members had to be practical so the work could progress. The paper was not perfect and it would never be so no matter how long it was discussed. He had a number of comments regarding where his delegation wished to see the process going. The Secretariat had to concentrate on implementation. First, the paper was called a Strategy, but it was largely also a description and other things. It was not a strategy where the objectives and means were clearly set out with time frames for implementation. His delegation recognized how difficult it was to put such a paper together, but took the paper as the document that described the objectives, pointed out the approaches and means available. His delegation was happy that mainstreaming had been recognized as a main point, that the roles Trade Policy Reviews could play had been highlighted in a more satisfactory way, that bilateral and international coordination had been taken up and that the question of monitoring and evaluation were part of the integrated concept, together with the ongoing changes in the Secretariat to improve its administrative structure. What was less clear was how the approaches matched the objectives. One question was how the Secretariat would act when there were contradictory approaches on certain issues and if there were ways to get around such situations. Agreement-by-Agreement approaches was for the rules implementation but not for all of technical assistance and capacity building. Those WT/COMTD/M/35 Page 22 types of points had to be worked out in more detail. The questions of whether there would be an implementation plan or a work-programme to follow up and how delegations would be able to see that the well intentioned and ably put down points would influence the day-to-day work.","WTCOMTDM35.pdf","European, Communities, EC, WTO, WTO, EC, Members, Secretariat, Secretariat, Secretariat"
"3520",3520,"9","9.      The representative of the European Communities gave the view, that as far as the Organization Internationale de la Francophonie (OIF) was concerned the CTD should show flexibility and allow it ad-hoc observer status. The OIF was already working together with the WTO on technical assistance matters, was represented in Geneva and could actually be present at meetings.","WTCOMTDM35.pdf","European, Communities, Organization, Internationale, de, la, Francophonie, CTD, WTO, Geneva"
"3521",3521,"90","90.     He went on to say that another observation his delegation had made was that the Strategy gave the impression that mainstreaming was a core WTO responsibility. It was mainly the countries themselves and other international organizations which dealt with that. The WTO could contribute and had to be conscious of it but could not drive the process. That was for others do to. The statement that the WTO technical assistance seeks ""to mainstream trade priority areas of action into national development plans…"" was somewhat too ambitious for what the WTO could do. It was nevertheless important that there was awareness of the concept and that work was done to make WTO action complementary in the field. Where do we go from here was the most important question and how the WTO would cooperate with international and regional organizations beyond the formalistic point of Memoranda of Understanding (MoUs) and the IF which were mentioned in the document. How the Strategy would be followed-up within the Secretariat was another important question. A Technical Assistance Management Committee (TAMC) had been established but delegations did not know how that Committee prepared the one-year plan. He wondered if everything had been cleared within that Committee and how the self-coordinated WTO Secretariat Annual Plan had been put together as it did not indicate why the various elements had been chosen and where the priorities came from. Some short justification for the individual projects in line with the Strategy and the objectives would be useful for transparency reasons. That would convince delegations that internal Secretariat coordination was functioning. Otherwise, the one-year plan only looked like a shortened version of the Strategy and that was not what it was supposed to be. He wished to hear the Secretariat representatives explain how follow-up and implementation were supposed to be handled. Paragraph 20 mentioned a review. That review should not only concern the Strategy but, above all, its implementation and the feed-back the Secretariat might wish to take from implementation back into the Strategy. Nevertheless, it was work in progress. The theory and principles should not be discussed forever. A great deal had been achieved with the Strategy and WTO technical cooperation should move forward, but delegations' comments should help to constantly improve it.","WTCOMTDM35.pdf","WTO, WTO, WTO, WTO, WTO, WTO, MoUs, Secretariat, Technical, Assistance, Management, Committee, Committee, Committee, WTO, Secretariat, Secretariat, Secretariat, Secretariat, WTO"
"3522",3522,"91","91.     The representative of Egypt said that his delegation welcomed the new Strategy and was prepared to take note of it in the Committee and move ahead with implementation while at the same time continue to upgrade an improve on it. It was important to reconfirm that the overarching objective of WTO technical assistance activities was to increase developing countries' share of world trade. When the technical assistance activities contributed to efforts aiming at achieving that goal, they would have successfully fulfilled their purpose. Everything in the new Strategy should be seen in that context: objectives and purposes referred to in the document should be tools and means to achieve that objective. One of the key fundamentals necessary to ensure effective implementation of the new Strategy was availability of resources on a stable basis. His delegation therefore supported the call in paragraph 4 for increased and predictable resources. The regular budget was the best means to ensure predictability while maintaining and regularly raising voluntary contributions, in addition to the needed regular resources, would provide sufficient increased resources. The various approaches listed in paragraph 6 were not and should not be mutually exclusive. That was stated in the following paragraph. However, the tools-box which grouped the various approaches should be given increased visibility, not only in the provision of technical assistance activities, but also in the evaluation of the distribution and effectiveness of those activities to all beneficiaries. That approach would also help the coordination discussed in Section III. With respect to Section III he said that mainstreaming of trade into the national development policies was an important concept that might play a role in yielding better results. However, it was necessary to underline that the mainstreaming exercise had primarily to be at the national level, in order to fit correctly in the context of the national policies and objectives. The first bullet under paragraph 8 emphasised the linkage between technical assistance and mainstreaming from an angle that his delegation believed should be dealt with in a different way. Referring to the fourth indent under the seventh bullet of paragraph 8, he said that the                                                                                     WT/COMTD/M/35                                                                                            Page 23 newly established Management Committee would, according to its terms of reference, invite Members, as necessary, to coordinate the delivery of technical assistance. He requested the Secretariat to provide Members with the terms of reference of the Management Committee. Based on the study of those terms of reference, it might be worthwhile to request the Secretariat to submit periodic reports on the work of the TAMC. Annex IV dealt with the Arab States and he suggested that the Economic Commission for Africa be included in its paragraph 43 which related to a MoU since many countries belonging to the North African Region would fall under the ECA and not under ESQUA, although ESQUA had a somewhat different mandate. As an editorial point he suggested that Djibouti be added to the footnote on page 17 as well as to paragraph 46 where the number of Arab States should be increased from 10 to 11. Finally, his delegation welcomed the willingness shown by the Secretariat in paragraph 47, to increase the volume and improve the quality of its technical assistance to other countries and hoped that that willingness would be transformed into practical and concrete activities.","WTCOMTDM35.pdf","Egypt, Committee, WTO, Management, Committee, Members, Secretariat, Members, Committee, Secretariat, TAMC, Arab, States, Economic, Commission, Africa, North, African, Region, ECA, ESQUA, Djibouti, Secretariat"
"3523",3523,"92","92.      The representative of Rwanda said that his delegation generally was satisfied with the Strategy and particularly with the integrated approach, with the cooperation activities with higher institutions of learning in the concerned countries as well as with the training of trainers. However, his delegation had three comments. First, the new Strategy had to be financed through the regular budget. In addition, it was necessary, at least for the LDCs, to get the technical assistance, starting with the permanent missions in Geneva. Third, the essential elements of the Strategy should be reflected in the Declaration of the Fourth Ministerial Conference.","WTCOMTDM35.pdf","Rwanda, Geneva"
"3524",3524,"93","93.      The representative of Peru said that it was important that the Strategy be financed. Even if a strategy were designed with deadlines and review mechanisms, it would not bring many benefits unless it was financed. That was of utmost importance as it was part of the concerns of developing countries in connection with a possible new round of negotiations. Section II of the document contained the right approaches. The ten core elements constituted a comprehensive strategy. The mainstreaming mechanism and its application was important in order to include technical assistance and capacity building at the national level. Efforts had been made in Peru with respect to the institutionalization of focal points and the creation of a national coordinating committee. A national commission with participation of both the public and the private sectors had been set up. Its mandate was to disseminate information, make broad policy guidelines and above all train businessmen, academics as well as government employees on WTO matters. The follow-up of the benefits of technical assistance was important as it was a means to improve and contribute to the improvement of technical assistance. Specific approaches on the basis of subjects or regions were worthwhile as they would lead to the application of technical assistance taking into account the characteristics and the special needs of each member. His delegation therefore supported the training of trainers who would become sources of information and dissemination on the rules and commitments which countries required within the WTO. These together with distance learning and appropriate links with academic institutions would have a positive multiplier effect. He therefore hoped that these elements would be included in the Annex relating to the Latin American and Caribbean countries. His delegation generally supported the Strategy and would continue improve on it.","WTCOMTDM35.pdf","Peru, Peru, WTO, WTO, Caribbean"
"3525",3525,"94","94.      The representative of Turkey said that he first had a comment regarding the allocation of priorities regarding the available technical assistance resources of the Secretariat. It was not surprising that the new Strategy gave high priority to the LDCs. His delegation had always been in favour of giving high priority for LDCs in technical assistance. However, that should be without prejudice to the rights of other developing countries. At least the current level of technical assistance provided to developing countries should not be reduced, and when possible, should be increased. The language of paragraph 15 did not fully address the specific concern of his delegation. Second, with respect to Annex V, he said that his delegation wished to see an explicit reference to two important regional organizations operating in his country's region: the Organization of the Black Sea Economic Cooperation and the Economic Cooperation Organization. The Secretariat had been working closely WT/COMTD/M/35 Page 24 with those two organizations and his delegation had been happy to see the fruitful results of that cooperation and was confident that the cooperation would continue in the future. It was therefore appropriate to make a clear reference to them in Annex V.","WTCOMTDM35.pdf","Turkey, Secretariat, LDCs, Organization, of, the, Black, Sea, Economic, Cooperation, Economic, Cooperation, Organization, Secretariat"
"3526",3526,"95","95.     The representative of Japan said that the Strategy covered and responded to many of the concerns raised in previous meetings. His delegation endorsed the Strategy. The first of his delegation's three concerns related to the fact that the WTO could not undertake everything. There were several dimensions to the development of a developing country, but the WTO was not the main executing agency for technical assistance and only covered a limited part of the whole picture of development. His delegation wished to see the WTO play an active part in mainstreaming trade into the development strategies of each country. In order to do that the WTO had to strengthen its coordination with other international organizations and bilateral donors. Second, his delegation was happy to note the new WTO unit for technical cooperation audit and wished to see the positive feedback from the outcome of auditing and monitoring. Third, there seemed to be some concern regarding the predictability of technical assistance funding. Several Members had raised the possibility to increase the regular budget. His Government wished to study that option, but as had been mentioned earlier, the WTO was not an executing agency for technical assistance. There were a certain amount of contributions on a voluntary basis to several trust funds. His delegation wished to see predictable funding by also utilising other resources.","WTCOMTDM35.pdf","Japan, WTO, WTO, WTO, WTO, WTO, Members, WTO"
"3527",3527,"96","96.     The representative of India said that his delegation welcomed the new Strategy, endorsed the thrust of it, and hoped that it would enable the Secretariat to follow a more coherent approach for the effective implementation of technical assistance.","WTCOMTDM35.pdf","India, Secretariat"
"3528",3528,"97","97.      The representative of Jamaica said that her delegation could support the new Strategy and believed that the methodology and approach were correct. However, it was noted that the new Strategy provided for technical assistance to regions. However, the new Strategy should also recognize the need of individual countries within regions as each country had its own needs and requirements for technical assistance. The WTO technical assistance had to respond to supply-side constraints through inter-agency collaboration. The current financing through the regular budget was inadequate. Her delegation supported a multi-year funding programme to give predictability and stability to the process. The new Strategy should accord prominence to paragraph 9 which referred to technical assistance delivered in Geneva. The Secretariat should endeavour to quantify the assistance with a view to identifying how it could be expanded. Lastly, Trade Policy Reviews were critical aspects of technical assistance and capacity building. The intervals between reviews were too long. For example, for countries such as Jamaica, Trade-Policy Reviews occurred every six years. That issue had to be addressed to see how the integration of the Trade-Policy Reviews could be carried out in a constructive manner.","WTCOMTDM35.pdf","Jamaica, WTO, Geneva, Secretariat, Jamaica, Trade-Policy, Reviews"
"3529",3529,"98","98.      The representative of Indonesia said that the Strategy provided a clear approach of the WTO Secretariat to technical assistance. Although his delegation agreed with much in the Strategy, a couple of aspects had to be kept in mind in the implementation for it to achieve its objectives. The problems and challenges faced by developing countries differed from one country to another and had become deeper and broader in nature. No ""one-size-fits-all"" approach to technical assistance for developing countries was applicable. It was therefore imperative that, before embarking on any technical assistance programme, both the WTO and the beneficiary countries, conducted problem identification. That would ensure that the technical assistance provided by the WTO would be tailored to the specific problems and needs of the developing countries or regions. The essence of any technical assistance was to help developing countries, not only to implement the WTO Agreements, but also to derive benefits from them. Only by adopting such a problem-oriented approach could developing countries reap the full benefits of the liberalized trading system. Although his delegation supported increased funding for technical assistance, it should not burden the share of the developing countries' contribution.

"3530",3530,"99","99.      The representative of Guinea said that her delegation had a procedural question. The subject was important and the documents provided to delegations were essentially in English which made it difficult for French- and Spanish-speaking delegations to work on and understand the document. Nevertheless, her delegation had made an attempt to study it. She informed Members that her Government had integrated trade into its Poverty Reduction Strategy. That was why Guinea was suited for the second phase of the pilot scheme of the IF. WTO technical assistance was directed towards making Members understand the rules and principles of the organization. That was why particular importance should be attached to the question of financing of technical assistance and why the financing had to be predictable and included in the regular budget of the WTO. Her delegation was pleased to see that some of the questions her delegation had raised with the Secretariat had been taken up in the Strategy such as cooperation with universities in developing countries on questions related to the WTO and the training of trainers in developing countries. Those were vital issues for people in developing countries to understand the WTO. However, her delegation was concerned with what was stated regarding modern information technologies. She asked how the WTO intended to hold on-line courses for participants in countries where information technology was scarce. For example there was only one reference centre in her ministry. Her delegation also wondered how the countries listed in the table on the IF in Section V of the Coordinated WTO Plan for Technical Assistance Activities had been selected. All LDCs had more or less the same needs. Apart from that, her delegation was satisfied with the new Strategy and hoped that it would be applied with the participation of all Members and that appropriate funding would be forthcoming in order for the objectives to be reached.","WTCOMTDM35.pdf","Guinea, Members, Guinea, WTO, Members, WTO, Secretariat, WTO, WTO, WTO, Members"

These companies are involved in a wide range of activities relating to electronic commerce, such as development of applications or software, call centres and web hosting, with the clear advantage of the telecommunications infrastructure and fibre optics capacity that Panama has to offer owing to its strategic geographical position. Panama currently has access to five fibre optic submarine cables (Global Crossing, Arcos, Maya, Cable Panamericana and the Cable and Wireless ring), a fact which considerably boosts its potential as a centre for electronic commerce and makes the Panamanian Isthmus an ideal location for setting up data centres.","WTCOMTDM36.pdf","Panama, Panama, Arcos, Maya"

In the area of support to SMEs and their real access to new technologies, the National Authority for Small and Medium Enterprises (ANPYME) created, this year, a credit guarantee programme for computer-related activities.

While this credit guarantee programme is not specifically aimed at stimulating electronic commerce among SMEs, nothing prevents the companies from taking advantage of the progamme to introduce or improve their technological capacity. Since ANPYME is currently in the process of selecting the financial institutions that will be admitted to the programme, it is too early to comment on any specific results that might give an idea of the programme's utility.","WTCOMTDM36.pdf","National, Authority, for, Small, and, Medium, Enterprises, ANPYME"

For example, medium-income users have rapid and efficient access (average connection speed of 56K) through digital exchanges set up at certain locations in the country.

Concerning the different modes of on-line commerce, business to business (B2B) has not undergone much growth in Panama, except in the financial sector, where it has been in use for some time.

Various State entities offer a number of online services and facilitate their work through electronic media, the most significant of which are the Panama Canal Authority, whose website offers detailed information on procurement of goods and services for the Panama Canal, and the Ministry of the Economy and Finance, whose website not only provides information, but also enables taxpayers to send their tax returns by magnetic media (although physical payment is still required). It is also worth mentioning that March of this year, saw the introduction of an Internet-based system called SICE (Integrated Foreign Trade System), which replaced SIDUNEA. SICE connects institutions involved in foreign trade, offering the possibility of preparing customs declarations and obtaining, online, most of the documentation relating to import customs transactions (including licences) which previously had to be obtained from different institutions. This system was created only recently, so that it is still not possible to complete the entire process online.

However, he first informed the Committee, that since its last meeting in October, the PrepCom had held a meeting in New York at which the WTO had been represented by the Deputy Director-General, Mr. Ablassé Ouedraogo and Mr. Alain Frank, Director, External Relations. The Secretariat was invited to inform the Committee of the latest developments in the UN process from a WTO perspective, and to introduce the new background note by the Secretariat contained in document WT/COMTD/W/94 of 21 November 2001. The Chairman further proposed that following the Secretariat's presentation, the meeting would be moved into informal mode, to allow a free exchange of views with Ambassador Jacoby, and subsequently the meeting would revert to formal mode.","WTCOMTDM36.pdf","Chairman, CTD, WTO, Committee, Ambassador, Ruth, Jacoby, Ambassador, Permanent, Mission, of, Sweden, UN, Bureau, Preparatory, Committee, CTD, Committee, New, York, WTO, Director-General, Ablassé, Ouedraogo, Alain, Frank, Director, Secretariat, Committee, UN, WTO, Secretariat, Chairman, Secretariat, Ambassador, Jacoby"

The Director of the Development Division stated that the WTO had been involved through the Membership and at Secretariat-level in the various stages of the preparatory process for the FFD Conference. The WTO was recognised as a major institutional stakeholder in the preparatory process for the Conference, which was to be held in Monterrey, Mexico in March 2002. He reiterated that Deputy Director-General Mr. Ablassé Ouedraogo and Mr. Alain Frank had attended the most recent PrepCom held in mid-October 2001. He went on to note that the October 2001 PrepCom meeting had been held before the Doha Ministerial. Doha was a watershed that made a difference in the WTO's approach to the FFD Conference, since WTO Members had now agreed to a Ministerial Declaration. At the October 2001 PrepCom meeting, the main item on the agenda had been the draft Outcome of the Facilitator, which had been distributed at the last CTD session. According to reports he had received, there had been substantive and lively discussion on the draft Outcome, which was to be revised and reissued at the end of November 2001.

"3571",3571,"16","16.      The Director then drew the meeting's attention to the Secretariat background note WT/COMTD/W/94. He apologised for the paper not being translated into the three languages but indicated that translation would soon be available. The paper aimed to give an accurate description of the process, the PrepCom and WTO's involvement in the process. The key issues raised in the note were contained in paragraph 30 on Page 5, and governed the interrelationship between what would happen in Geneva following Doha, and the ongoing process in New York in the lead up to the Monterrey Conference. Four questions were raised in this regard: (1) How can the FFD process contribute to the furthering of the results of the Doha declaration? (2) How can elements of the Doha declaration be incorporated into the discussions on FFD? (3) How should the two institutions of the WTO and UN best cooperate in the future, especially in this regard? and (4) How can individual members ensure that trade and development issues are treated in a consistent manner within the two processes? The Secretariat thought that it was important to maintain consistency in the flow of information between New York and Geneva in the process leading to the Conference in Monterrey in 2002. He hoped that some of the questions would be used as a background to the informal discussions to be held with Ambassador Jacoby later on.

"3572",3572,"17","17.      H. E. Ms. Ruth Jacoby, Ambassador, Permanent Mission of Sweden to the UN, congratulated the WTO membership on the results of Doha and indicated that she was impressed and encouraged by the results that had been achieved. Members of the WTO should have been proud. The last PrepCom had been held in October 2001 and had brought about many discussions and negotiations. She felt encouraged by a number of things that had happened since that PrepCom meeting. One was the Ministerial Conference in Doha, and another was the meetings of the Development Committee and the International Monetary and Financial Committee (IMFC) recently held in Ottawa (17-18 November 2001), where Ministers of Finance and Ministers of Development Cooperation had agreed on two Communiqués, one of which she felt was particularly forward looking and represented the latest, most authoritative view on the trends of world development and the direction to be taken. Those two important Ministerial meetings had set the parameters and framework for substantially moving forward the common agenda of development and improvements in standards of living in the developing countries, in the coming months. That was encouraging.","WTCOMTDM36.pdf","Ruth, Jacoby, Ambassador, Permanent, Mission, of, Sweden, UN, WTO, Doha, Members, WTO, Doha, Development, Committee, International, Monetary, and, Financial, Committee, Ottawa, Communiqués"
"3573",3573,"18","18.      Ambassador Jacoby went on to indicate that the next meeting of the PrepCom of the FFD process would take place in mid-January 2002 for two weeks, and it was presumed to be the last PrepCom meeting, before the actual Conference. It would definitely be the last formal PrepCom, but it was possible that there would be some intersessional last minute drafting exercises before March 2002, and a lot of work was on-going. The Facilitator, who had prepared a first draft of an Outcome document which was circulated to the CTD at its last meeting, was working on a revised draft after having received comments from members during the last PrepCom meeting. This revised document would be discussed again at the January 2002 meeting.","WTCOMTDM36.pdf","Ambassador, Jacoby, CTD"
"3574",3574,"19","19.     The representative of the European Communities agreed that the Conference was an important event which should be seen in the perspective of the important work that the WTO was trying to commence after Doha. He said he wished to ensure that the WTO had some messages for the Ambassador to take to New York in order to achieve an optimum result of the Conference. He acknowledged that the Members had channels in New York to do so, but was of the view that it was appropriate to have discussions at the WTO, given the past involvement of the WTO and also the future approach which the CTD had been informed about. The WTO had played an important role in the process. The questions outlined in the background note were pertinent, and outlined how his delegation saw the follow-up to Doha developing. The most important point was that the Conference was a platform to consolidate, reinvigorate and make known to a broader constituency outside the trade world, the results – namely, the development dimension of the Doha Declaration - which was innovative, new, and much more development-oriented than before.

"3575",3575,"2","2.       The Chairman introduced the draft Agenda for the meeting, contained in airgram WTO/AIR/1661/Rev.1 of 23 November 2001. He said that it was his intention to only have one discussion on special and differential treatment under agenda item D. He therefore suggested that the two sub-items under agenda item D be merged and that the Secretariat document be used as a starting-point for the discussions on the work programme on special and differential treatment contained in the decision on implementation related issues and concerns adopted by Ministers in Doha. He recalled that Ministers had instructed the CTD to take fully into consideration previous work undertaken as noted in WT/COMTD/W/77/Rev.1.","WTCOMTDM36.pdf","Chairman, Secretariat, Doha, CTD"
"3576",3576,"20","20.     The Conference would also be expected to be complementary in areas where the WTO could not deliver all the promises in the Doha Declaration on its own. This was especially with respect to technical assistance and capacity-building, where many of the commitments in the Doha declaration could only be delivered with the help of Members development agencies or Ministries and Ministries of Foreign Affairs. Policy consistency and follow-up were necessary, in addition to strong political commitment, to ensure that what had been agreed to at Doha came into effect. This was not only true for technical assistance and capacity building, but for the substantive contributions which were mentioned in the Facilitator's first draft outcome document and other reports from the preparatory process.","WTCOMTDM36.pdf","WTO, Doha, Members, Doha"
"3577",3577,"21","21.      He drew attention to the trade part - and to a lesser extent to the development, debt and other issues parts - of the existing facilitator's draft outcome document and indicated that there were many points that were already made and could be reinforced and made more concrete after Doha. For example, the draft outcome document started with the general message that trade liberalisation was a useful tool. This however, needed to be re-modelled, as it was not just any type of trade liberalisation but was very specific. The draft outcome document went on to consider anti-dumping, and the strengthening of rules and disciplines – things that the WTO had decided to do in the Ministerial declaration. The document also mentioned further liberalisation of trade in agricultural products – the WTO had a firm, new mandate for the agricultural negotiations. The reduction of tariff peaks which affect developing countries exports was also mentioned in the document – the WTO had concrete non-agricultural market access negotiations coming up, including some analytical work on exactly what it meant for developing countries. In addition, the draft outcome document referred to textiles and trade and health – again, the WTO had a declaration on these issues coming out of Doha. The document also discussed regional trade integration, on which there was a negotiating mandate within the WTO for better rules. The document also addressed market access (the Everything But Arms initiative) and the issue of coherence, among many others. In the area of investment, the draft outcome document looked at how to ensure that developing countries have a capacity, and that the international system should be responsive to the fostering private investment flows. The Fourth Ministerial Declaration again gave the WTO a mandate to look at rules in this area.","WTCOMTDM36.pdf","Doha, WTO, WTO, WTO, WTO, Doha, WTO, WTO"
"3578",3578,"22","22.     His delegation was of the view that developments emerging from Doha should be reflected and followed-up in the FFD Ministerial Declaration with concrete pointers saying, ""we note and take note again of these commitments, and we will do our part these commitments are followed-up, that the money is there, that the political commitment is shared by our governments in this Conference, as well as those who went to Doha."" In the area of technical assistance, which was an important area with respect to the financing question, the delegate went on to state that the facilitator's draft outcome document called for multilateral and bilateral donors to work on the issue. The WTO Ministerial declaration also called for coherence in this field.","WTCOMTDM36.pdf","Doha, Doha, WTO"
"3579",3579,"23","23.      The representative of the European Communities proposed that, to get the ""good news of Doha"" into the UN process, in addition to meetings held in Geneva and New York, the WTO Secretariat could be asked to briefly look in a factual way, at what had been decided that was relevant to the themes of the International Conference. Such a factual paper would indicate for each item in the FFD, how it was concretely addressed in the Doha Declaration, what the commitment was, and what the WTO Membership had agreed to do. This would ensure that the decisions and ideas from Doha were included in the process and that the WTO had something to say on the elements of the FFD process, be it reinforcing or complementary to the political objectives which all WTO members shared. His delegation would therefore propose going beyond the recommendation in the WTO Secretariat's background note provided in paragraph 29, and not only make an intervention on the results of Doha, but provide a factual analysis, aimed at putting together the elements which were already in the Facilitator's draft outcome document and other papers which had come out from the FFD process, and point out how the developments that have come out of Doha were relevant. The idea was to give the persons who had to decide on concrete action and concrete commitments in the WT/COMTD/M/36 Page 6 FFD process a solid basis to do so, without having to read the whole WTO Declaration in order to find the all the sections/paragraphs on one issue. The WTO Secretariat, possibly under its own responsibility, could be tasked to sum up and provide such a paper to the Conference.

"3580",3580,"24","24.    The Chairman recalled that earlier in 2001, the CTD had sent a contribution to the Preparatory Committee, contained in document WT/COMTD/30, and that at that time, the WTO had been working towards the Doha Ministerial Conference. The WTO was currently in a new situation: the Ministerial Declaration and Decisions had been adopted; the decision on the extension of transition periods for subsidies had been taken; and the waiver of GATT 1994 for the EU/ACP Cotonou Convention had been adopted.. The WTO had a clear work programme of negotiations and other work which would take it through to 2005. In addition, the WTO had admitted China and Chinese Taipei as Members.","WTCOMTDM36.pdf","Chairman, CTD, Preparatory, Committee, WTO, WTO, GATT, WTO, WTO, China, Taipei, Members"
"3581",3581,"25","25.     He therefore proposed that, as a first step, the CTD as the official point of contact for the FFD process, should send copies of the Ministerial Declaration, the Decision on Implementation-Related Issues and Concerns, the Declaration on TRIPS and Public Health, the Decision on extensions under Article 27.4 of the Subsidies Agreement, and the Decision on the EU/ACP Waiver, to the Co-Chairs of the FFD Preparatory Committee for the information of the Preparatory Committee at its next meeting in January 2002. He further proposed that at the January 2002 meeting of the PrepCom, the WTO Secretariat and himself could update the PrepCom on developments in Geneva since 26 November 2001, in particular on steps towards the creation of a Trade Negotiations Committee (TNC). At the January 2002 Preparatory Committee meeting, it would be open to any Member to state their views concerning the Work Programme of the WTO and the contribution that it might make towards FFD. He reminded the Members of the EU's proposal, which had been endorsed by Switzerland, for the Secretariat to undertake work on areas in which cooperation should continue, and enquired whether Members would be agreeable to that process.","WTCOMTDM36.pdf","CTD, Public, Health, FFD, Preparatory, Committee, Preparatory, Committee, WTO, Secretariat, Geneva, Trade, Negotiations, Committee, TNC, Preparatory, Committee, Member, Work, Programme, WTO, Members, EU, Switzerland, Secretariat, Members"
"3582",3582,"26","26.       The representative from the United States asked exactly what the representative of the EC had suggested. References had been made to anti-dumping and other elements, when the development of the trade section of the paper on FFD was being described. The proposal needed to be discussed more, informally, for all to get a better idea what they would be agreeing to with respect to the illustrative list proposed.","WTCOMTDM36.pdf","United, States, EC"
"3583",3583,"27","27.     The representative of the European Communities indicated that the idea was to ask the WTO Secretariat to draw up a more succinct report of what had happened in Doha, rather than just sending the Fourth Ministerial Declaration. The proposed report would make clear where the elements that had been identified so far in the FFD discussion were addressed in the Declaration. The major part would be on technical assistance and capacity building because there were so many firm commitments to be followed-up. It was also worth noting that many of the other substantive points which the Facilitator and others had raised which would be the elements which would really be conclusive to financing development by using trade means, such as better market access. For example, it could be stated that the question of market access had been addressed and that the WTO had a commitment to negotiate further. What the specific commitments were in the Least-Developed Countries (LDC) section of the Declaration, could also be pointed out. That would enable a reader to have a succinct and comprehensive overview of what the relevant commitments undertaken in the Declaration were and that would assist the New York based FFD process. The aim would not be to push anyone into a negotiating position. It was a fact that the WTO had agreed to strengthen the rules for example, and the language that was in the WTO Ministerial declaration paragraph on rules, did make reference to certain disciplines.

"3584",3584,"28","28.      The representative of Canada indicated that the proposal did not cause them any problem. It was a good proposal, although some concerns might need to be worked out. It was a good idea to indicate succinctly what could be done within the confines of the WTO and what went beyond that. It should be indicated, where linkages were necessary, and where the coherence agenda would have to come into play, to make it clear that the World Bank, IMF and other organisations would be drawn into certain of the supply-side considerations in particular.","WTCOMTDM36.pdf","Canada, WTO, World, Bank, IMF"
"3585",3585,"29","29.      The representative of Argentina, indicated that there might be certain costs for developing countries from the Doha Declaration, and the proposed factual report should not lose sight of them it was to give a balanced picture of the situation. That had to be further considered, so they were not in a position to come up with an analysis at that time.","WTCOMTDM36.pdf","Argentina"

"3587",3587,"30","30.     The respresentative of the United States said that her delegation would welcome an informal discussion on what the list may entail, since her delegation might not necessarily share the views of certain other delegations, although it would probably share some of the indications coming from the representative of Canada, especially with respect to the supply-side requirements and the linkages that would be found in the International Conference. She also found some of the comments by the representative of Argentina interesting. She did not wish to re-draft the WTO Declaration and Decisions, which had been negotiated intensively in Doha.","WTCOMTDM36.pdf","United, States, Canada, Argentina, WTO, Doha"
"3588",3588,"31","31.      The representative of Japan indicated there seemed to be a lot of capacity building and similar supporting activities included in the Declaration, and the WTO had to work with the other international, regional and bilateral donors to implement those activities. He therefore wished to see the proposed paper, if such a paper was prepared, include the good collaboration and cooperation in a coherent manner to work toward the common target of development. He supported the advantage expressed by previous speakers that supply-side capacity constraints, including infrastructure hardware with regard to trade, had to be tackled in a coordinated manner. The WTO was not accustomed to doing that all alone. Wording with respect to further cooperation and collaboration therefore had to be included.","WTCOMTDM36.pdf","Japan, WTO, WTO"
"3589",3589,"32","32.     The representative of Paraguay found that the proposal risked interpreting the Doha Declaration. That was why such a proposal had to be taken with caution and judiciousness. He agreed with the representative of Canada that it should be much more a question of looking at ways to supplement the Doha Declaration, but the Committee should not look for ways of interpreting what had actually been stated in the Doha Declaration, as that would be dangerous.","WTCOMTDM36.pdf","Paraguay, Canada, Committee"
"3590",3590,"33","33.     At this point in the discussion, the Chairman reminded the meeting that there were two proposals: the proposal of the representative of the European Communities and a proposal to send the factual documents which were previously indicated - the Ministerial Declaration, the Decision on Implementation-Related Issues and Concerns, the Declaration on TRIPS and Public Health, the Decision on Extensions under Article 27.4 of the Subsidies Agreement, and the Decision on the EU/ACP Waiver - without any comment, duly notifying them of the decisions taken. The latter proposal did not seem to raise any problems. There was also a proposal to update the PrepCom on progress in the preparation of the setting up of the WTO TNC. He hoped that that this could be agreed. With respect to the proposal made by the representative of the EC, he noted that although there had not been opposition, it has been agreed that further discussion was necessary. The Committee could consult later on how to proceed on that issue. No decision could be taken at that moment.","WTCOMTDM36.pdf","Chairman, European, Communities, Public, Health, WTO, TNC, EC, Committee"
"3591",3591,"34","34.     The representative of the European Communities said that with respect to what the representative of Paraguay had said, it was not a question of an interpretation of the WTO declaration. The idea was to give persons who prepare for FFD, a tool, showing them what had been done at Doha on the issues in the FFD process. For example, the Facilitator and others had raised the issue of WT/COMTD/M/36 Page 8 Market access. The market access sections of the Doha Declaration could then be quoted. He understood that some delegations were uneasy about what the proposal actually meant and how it could be done, so he agreed to the Chair's suggestion to continue the discussion informally. However, the Committee should not wait too long since the PrepCom meeting was in January 2002.","WTCOMTDM36.pdf","European, Communities, Paraguay, WTO, Doha, Committee"
"3592",3592,"35","35.    The representative of the United States stated that even if a factual document was prepared, it could be of concern, as a factual presentation could contain an indication of an interpretation by the mere fact of what was placed in it. More time was needed to get a better sense of what the exercise was about. The CTD should consider what the next steps were as far as a WTO contribution was concerned. Even if it was to be a factual listing, Members would need to say what that factual listing would be.","WTCOMTDM36.pdf","United, States, CTD, WTO, Members"

"3602",3602,"44","44.      The Chairman said that the issue of Special and Differential Treatment (S&D) had been given a new departure in the Doha Ministerial Declaration, to which the CTD had to respond urgently. As reflected in paragraph 44 of the Ministerial Declaration (WT/MIN(01)DEC/1), Ministers had agreed that that all S&D provisions should be reviewed with a view to strengthening them and making them more precise, effective and operational. In that connection, they had endorsed the work programme contained in Paragraph 12 of the Decision on Implementation-Related Issues and                                                                                   WT/COMTD/M/36                                                                                           Page 9 Concerns (WT/MIN(01)/17), also adopted at Doha. Copies of the text of the work programme on S&D were available at the back of the room. As delegations would have noted, two aspects of the work programme had firm deadlines instructing the CTD to report to the General Council with clear recommendations for a decision by July 2002. It was therefore critically important to commence the work immediately and that Members considered how they wished to organize the work. Only three formal Committee meetings had been scheduled before the end of July 2002. It would therefore be necessary to schedule a number of informal meetings, in addition to the formal meetings, if the CTD wished to make good progress. In principle, he proposed to call one informal meeting a month in order to ensure progress on S&D. However, that programme might have to be varied according to the progress made.","WTCOMTDM36.pdf","Chairman, CTD, Doha, CTD, General, Council, Members, Committee, CTD"
"3603",3603,"45","45.      He went on to recall that the work the CTD carried out was without prejudice to that carried out in respect of implementation by other WTO bodies. In that connection he drew delegations' attention to the fact that other WTO bodies would be carrying out work on specific S&D provisions, either under the mandate handed to them by the Decision on Implementation-Related Issues and Concerns, or as part of their treatment of outstanding implementation issues under paragraph 12 of the Ministerial Declaration. He would be seeking the guidance of Members, as the work progressed, on how to coordinate the work done in the CTD with that done elsewhere, in order to meet the CTD mandate, and to avoid duplication of efforts. Regarding how the CTD approached the substance of its work, he suggested that the meeting focussed in particular on that part of the mandate contained in paragraph (i), of the work programme, which instructed the CTD to do the following three things, and then to report to the General Council with clear recommendations for a decision by July 2002. Those three things were:         •       to identify those special and differential treatment provisions that were already                 mandatory in nature and those that were non-binding in character;         •       to consider the legal and practical implications for developed and developing                 Members of converting special and differential treatment measures into mandatory                 provisions; and         •       to identify those that Members consider should be made mandatory.","WTCOMTDM36.pdf","WTO, WTO, Members, CTD, CTD, CTD, CTD, General, Council, Members, Members"
"3604",3604,"46","46.      As a starting-point for the discussions, he suggested that the Committee used the information provided in Document WT/COMTD/W//77/Rev.1. That document contained, amongst other things, a discussion of the operation of S&D, an illustrative list of questions, and also the nucleus of a distinction between provisions that were mandatory and those that were not. He also recalled that Ministers had instructed the CTD to take fully into consideration previous work undertaken as noted in WT/COMTD/W/77/Rev.1. Members had had that document in their possession for some time, and he was convinced that it had prompted many thoughts. He therefore urged Members to direct their comments towards taking forward the work the Committee had been mandated by Ministers to carry out. Document WT/COMTD/W/77/Rev.1 was not an exclusive basis for work. For a start, he believed that it would be useful to ask the Secretariat to assist the Committee by identifying in more depth the mandatory S&D provisions. Of course, Members were free to make their own proposals, and he recalled that Ministers had taken note of a proposal for a Framework Agreement on S&D made by a group of Members. He suggested that the Committee proceeded by holding its first discussion in informal mode. However, if any delegation wished to make a statement for the record, an opportunity to do so would be provided after the informal discussion.","WTCOMTDM36.pdf","Committee, CTD, Members, Members, Committee, Secretariat, Committee, Members, S&D, Members, Committee"

The Chairman said that at the last meeting of the Committee, Members had had before them a Note by the Secretariat entitled ""The Generalised System of Preferences: A preliminary analysis of the GSP schemes in the Quad"" contained in document WT/COMTD/W/93. That study had been prepared in response to requests from delegations for further information on the benefits of the Generalized System of Preferences. However, as the document had only been issued shortly before the last meeting, it had been decided to give Members more time to study it and another chance to revert to it.","WTCOMTDM36.pdf","Chairman, Committee, Members, Secretariat, GSP, Members"
"3607",3607,"49","49.      The representative of Sri Lanka said that her delegation found the document a useful source of reference, particularly for developing country users of the GSP schemes. It described the schemes of the Quad countries, reviled shortcomings and suggested solutions as to how those shortcomings could be overcome. Delegations should be given more time to elaborate on the text. Her delegation therefore suggested that the item be retained on the agenda for the next formal meeting of the Committee. One conclusion that could be drawn was that the share of trade covered by the GSP compared to the share of trade covered by MFN was fairly small. Another was that few beneficiaries were using the GSP scheme effectively. One reason for that was the supply-constraints of developing countries which had led to the question of graduation and counter-graduation. In addition, when comparing the agricultural and the non-agricultural sectors, the report reviled that the utilization was higher in the industrial, non-agricultural product sector. In order to enhance the utilization of the GSP there was a need to focus on those product sectors. From the statistical part of the part of the paper showing the utilization rates, it was clear that the situation had not changed during the last couple of years. Sri Lanka's utilization rate of the United States GSP scheme was fairly high as most of the items entered duty-free. However, the actual coverage of the United States' GSP scheme had to be analyzed as certain important sectors had been excluded. Whereas the European Communities' scheme had a broader coverage, the utilization rate was lower. The reason for that was known. It was the rigid rules of origin requirements and quota restrictions. The report could be a guide of how to improve the GSP schemes. She had cited the reasons for her country's low utilization rate, however, other Members would have other explanations for their low utilization rates.","WTCOMTDM36.pdf","Sri, Lanka, GSP, Committee, GSP, MFN, GSP, Sri, Lanka, United, States, United, States, GSP, Members"

The last sentence of paragraph 23 on page 7 of the English version stated, with respect to the Canadian GPS scheme that ""Agricultural products included in the scheme are covered by a positive list, while excluded industrial goods are given in a negative list.""

"3610",3610,"51","51.     The representative of the United States said that the Note, in the future, could include more information on how beneficiary countries were taking advantage of the GSP.

"3611",3611,"52","52.     The representative of the European Communities praised the study for its analytical qualities. The points made in part V were the most important ones. The questions of utilization and utility addressed in the tables were interesting. The two should not be confused and utility is what really counts in the end. His delegation concurred with the questions put forward in part V. One of the conclusions was that preferences could be useful but that they were not always used and that one of the reasons for that was the supply-side constraints. Another reason was the one the European         1             See WT/COMTD/W/93/Corr.1.

His delegation was willing to work on the issues put forward as his delegation believed that these schemes still were useful. The Note and the conclusions that could be drawn from it were useful for the negotiations which were to begin in agriculture, industrial tariffs and regional trading agreements. All of them could benefit from a background showing how certain preferences work. In addition, the Note was also relevant for the identification of technical assistance needs and constraints of developing countries. The Note was a reminder to his delegation, as a granter of preferences, that it could still do better. The instrument which constituted the GSP would not be abandoned in the near future, it would be improved. Long discussions on preferences had also been held in other parts of the WTO and they demonstrated that preferences, if applied correctly, did work. The discussions should be led by those who used the preferences to get access to developed country markets. More comments from beneficiaries would therefore be welcome. It would be useful, if the resources of the Secretariat permitted, not only to look at the Quad countries, but also the ambitious schemes of some other countries which could be a source of future innovation and future reflection on how the GSP instrument could be used and improved.","WTCOMTDM36.pdf","GSP, WTO, Secretariat, GSP"

It was available on the UNCTAD Website for free download2 and delegations should have received copies through the official UN distribution system to the Geneva-based missions. If delegates still required hard copies, the UNCTAD Secretariat would be happy to provide extra copies. The overview of the report was available outside the meeting room in the three WTO languages while the main report was in English only. It was the first time that UNCTAD had considered the issue of e-commerce and development in such a comprehensive way even though UNCTAD had worked on e-commerce and Information and Communication Technologies (ICT)-related issues, particularly in the area of trade facilitation for a long time. It was a new publication which UNCTAD planned to release on an annual basis in the future. The goal with UNCTAD's work in this area, and with the report, was to assist developing countries benefit from the new technologies and that way contribute to the narrowing of the digital divide. The report should also be considered as an input into the UN Secretary General's new task force on ICTs which had held its first meeting the previous week in New York, US.","WTCOMTDM36.pdf","Teltscher, UNCTAD, UN, UNCTAD, Secretariat, WTO, UNCTAD, UNCTAD, Information, and, Communication, Technologies, UNCTAD, UNCTAD, UN, New, York, US"

The introduction discussed the lessons learned from the previous year's ""dot com""-crisis. The first chapter treated the subject of measuring electronic commerce. The second related to e-commerce and economic growth. The following chapters were about e-tourism, e-marketplaces, e-government, legal and regulatory issues, electronic payments and logistics in the e-commerce age. Finally, there were two empirical chapters; one on e-commerce in ten LDCs and one on China.","WTCOMTDM36.pdf","LDCs, China"
"3624",3624,"64","64.      She said that she wished to share a few of the results of the UNCTAD ""E-commerce and Development Report 2001"" in various areas. There was a discussion on what had happened in the past year as far as the Internet market was concerned and the rise and fall of the ""dot com"" companies. One of the lessons drawn from those developments were that the economic and business implications of ICT and the Internet had to be properly understood by all players: companies, investors and consumers. The same business rules applied to the ""new economy""-companies as applied to the ""old economy""-companies. Developing countries had largely remained unaffected by those events, mainly because they had not had access to the same amount of venture capital as companies in the developed countries, especially companies in the U.S. It was an opportunity for companies in developing countries to learn from the mistakes and misconceptions that had prevailed in the past years on the Internet market. One of the conclusions drawn in the introductory chapter was that the changes brought about by ICT and e-commerce would be fundamental and lasting and that the actual benefits and the potential that the new technologies would bring were only beginning to become obvious. A main challenge ahead was related to the business culture. That was true for both developed and developing countries. Many other challenges were also discussed in the report but unless businesses changed as far as their flexibility and openness was concerned towards adopting e-commerce strategies it would be difficult to participate in the new developments.         2             http://www.unctad.org/ecommerce/docs/edr01_en.htm                                                                                   WT/COMTD/M/36                                                                                          Page 13","WTCOMTDM36.pdf","UNCTAD, ICT, U.S., ICT"
"3625",3625,"65","65.      The second chapter of the UNCTAD ""E-commerce and Development Report 2001"" looked at measuring electronic commerce. Even if many were interested in how much e-commerce there really was, most data provided by the private sector companies only provided rough estimates. Those estimates of the value of e-commerce in a given future year varied substantially depending on which source it came from. The lack of information about the value of e-commerce was a real problem. The fact that the numbers varied and the data was incomparable as they were based on different definitions and methodologies had been giving rise to an international effort towards providing guidelines which could be used for measuring e-commerce. As a result of that effort a working definition of e-commerce was available as were statistical indicators which could be used by national statistical offices. Some national offices had begun to collect e-commerce statistics. That had proven to be useful for policy makers as well as for businesses when taking decisions on investment and other policies. There was an urgent need for coordination and cooperation in the area of e-commerce statistics, in particular between those statistical offices which already had experience in measuring e-commerce with statistical offices in developing countries who wished to begin but who did not yet have experience.","WTCOMTDM36.pdf","UNCTAD"
"3626",3626,"66","66.     The macro-economic impact of e-commerce was dealt with in a separate chapter of the UNCTAD ""E-commerce and Development Report 2001"". An economic model had been used to calculate some of the implications of ICT. It was assumed that ICT would raise the productivity in the services sector. Based on that assumption, the UNCTAD Secretariat had worked with two scenarios: one in which developing countries fell behind the developed countries as far as their productivity growth in the services sector was concerned, and a second in which the developing countries caught up with the developed countries. In the second case, a productivity growth had been simulated in selected developing countries only. A number of results for different variables had been achieved. In the first scenario in which a 1 per cent productivity growth had been simulated in developed countries only, the result was that there would be negative changes in economic welfare in all developing country regions apart from Asia. Whereas in the second scenario where a 1 per cent productivity increase were simulated in selected developing countries only, positive welfare gains were noted in those regions. The 1 per cent productivity change was an arbitrary number and the figures should not be taken as absolute numbers, but rather underline the importance that new technologies can play for countries' productivity growth and its possible implications for their macro-economic indicators.","WTCOMTDM36.pdf","ICT, ICT, UNCTAD, Secretariat, Asia"
"3627",3627,"67","67.      The UNCTAD ""E-commerce and Development Report 2001"" also included a chapter on legal and regulatory issues. She would only mention two issues: taxation and customs duties. As far as taxation was concerned, there had been a large discussion on sales taxes and which jurisdiction should be applied for e-commerce, the one for the consumer or the one of the supplier. The current tendency seemed to be to apply the jurisdiction of the consumer, although it was not yet clear how the sales taxes would be collected from foreign suppliers in those cases. For example, there had been a debate in the European Communities regarding taxation and foreign suppliers supplying European Community consumers with goods delivered electronically were currently exempted from sales tax. With respect income tax collection from businesses, there had been discussions about how the concept of permanent establishment would apply in cyberspace with respect to e-commerce. The OECD countries had agreed that a web-server could constitute a fix place of business or permanent establishment of a company, if that company owned the server, and if the company carried on its main business activities through the server. The company would then have to pay taxes in the country of location of the server. As far as customs duties were concerned, WTO Members had extended the Moratorium on customs duties on electronically transmissions for two more years. There had been questions about the potential fiscal implications of that decision. The UNCTAD Secretariat had carried out extensive calculations at the country level. Import revenues had been calculated on digitised products (software, music, printed matters, video-products) based on 1999 imports. The value of the tariff revenue that potentially could be foregone was about 1 billion US dollars. The developing countries would have the larger share of that. If other duties were added, surcharges and WT/COMTD/M/36 Page 14 import duties such as consumption taxes on imports the value added up to a potential loss of 8 billion US dollars. In that case, developed countries would take the larger share of the loss, given their large trade volumes and high consumption taxes on the products concerned.","WTCOMTDM36.pdf","UNCTAD, European, Community, OECD, WTO, Members, UNCTAD, Secretariat"
"3628",3628,"68","68.      E-tourism was the topic of Chapter Three. It was an area that was important in e-commerce and it mainly referred to on-line bookings and reservations of flights and hotels. It was a leading sector in business-to-consumer e-commerce, because at the point of sale, the tourism product was largely an information product and was therefore ideally suited for marketing and selling over the Internet. It had been an important sector for developing countries. The UNCTAD Secretariat estimated that currently about 50 per cent of all e-commerce took place in the area of tourism and that there was good potential for increases in that sector. Developing countries only had about a 3 per cent market share in e-tourism but it was estimated that it could be increased to about 30 per cent. The chapter discussed the type of action that could be taken to increase the share of developing countries in the sector.","WTCOMTDM36.pdf","UNCTAD, Secretariat"
"3629",3629,"69","69.     In the chapter on LDCs there were some interesting examples of servicing the Diaspora market. Family members who lived abroad would order goods and services from home through the Internet. Teleservices such as remote processing (data processing, software development) and on-line call centers. A number of interesting examples of call centers were spelt out in the report. In Togo, Internet telephony had been used to get around some of the Internet access costs. A number of sectors where developing countries companies made successful use of the Internet were discussed. Some of the solutions had been to use secure servers and on-line payment facilities in other countries to allow customers to buy and make electronic payments through the Internet. That would progressively create consumer trust which was a key goal for a company to become successful on the Internet.","WTCOMTDM36.pdf","Togo"

"3631",3631,"70","70.       The UNCTAD ""E-commerce and Development Report 2001"" contained a chapter on developments in China. China had impressive growth-rates of the number of Internet users: the rate had doubled every six months between 1997 and 2000. The mobile-phone market was also increasing rapidly. Almost 100 per cent in 2000 and China currently had the largest market in the world of mobile phone subscriptions. It had even surpassed the U.S. with 120 million subscribers. The UNCTAD report estimated that the current figure of 27 million Internet users would increase to 68 million by 2005 which was still only 5 per cent of the population. However, the growth curve would begin to flatten, while still showing growth, as had already happened in the US and in some EU countries. The IT industry already contributed 12 per cent to China's GDP growth but it was still in its infancy and there were a number of barriers that had to be tackled such as trust, business culture, Internet access costs. The lack of credit card use made on-line payment almost impossible. Language and content restrictions added additional burdens for Internet service providers in China. The gradual opening of the telecommunications and the financial sector, which both were important for the development o e-commerce, could be expected to improve the environment for e-commerce in China. It was therefore likely that further development and improvement of e-commerce in China would take place within the short to medium term.","WTCOMTDM36.pdf","UNCTAD, China, China, China, U.S., UNCTAD, US, EU, China, China, China, China"
"3632",3632,"71","71.      The representative of the United States said that her delegation had taken note of the effects and impacts on developed and developing countries. She had found the calculations of the fiscal losses, as mentioned in the executive summary distributed, to be particularly interesting. In that connection, she noted that the draft work programme for the CTD included a seminar on the issue of fiscal implications. The CTD work programme had been initiated in 1998 and an overall WTO work programme on e-commerce had been launched under the supervision of the General Council. The mandate for the overall work had recently been renewed. Her delegation asked whether the UNCTAD calculations regarding fiscal losses were similar to the World Bank analysis on the same issue carried out two or three years back. It would be particularly interesting to see what kind of product coverage UNCTAD had used as far as including certain digital products in the calculations were concerned. She asked if any comparison had been made as to the scope of the analysis. It was                                                                                      WT/COMTD/M/36                                                                                             Page 15 interesting to note that developed countries took the larger burden due to consumption taxes and their volume of trade, as was the concern that absolute losses of tariff revenues and potential tariff revenues foregone in developing countries owed to higher tariffs applied to the digital products traded. It would be interesting to consider the possible effects of imports of digitised products over time. Developed countries were willing to recognize the gains in comparison to the losses even though there might be a concern of the level of the revenue loss.","WTCOMTDM36.pdf","United, States, CTD, CTD, WTO, General, Council, World, Bank, UNCTAD"
"3633",3633,"72","72.      The representative of Brazil said that the issue of fiscal implications and forgone revenue was one of the issues of the report which was of interest to his delegation as well. On page 125 of the report, the study seemed to indicate that there was a consensus in the WTO regarding the Moratorium on customs duties and on any implications of that Moratorium on internal taxes. The consensus was that the Moratorium only covered tariffs, not internal taxes. Both the Geneva and the Doha Ministerial Declarations reflected that understanding. In light of that, he asked why, in the calculations of foregone revenue, the UNCTAD Secretariat had taken foregone tax revenue, in particular consumer taxes such as VAT and sales taxes into account. The Study made reference to a group of products used as the basis for the calculation of the tariff losses. It was said on page 126 that ""…a number of commodities have been selected, which traditionally have been shipped physically and been subject to border tariffs, but which today can be transformed into a digitized format and sent through the Internet"". The study made reference to a footnote, but the footnote in turn referred the reader to another study. Although some examples of the type of products were given, such as (i) printed matter; (ii) software; (iii) music and other media products; (iv) film; and (v) video games, he sought clarification as to which the products included were, with specific examples. He suggested that it would be more accurate to say that that revenue might be foregone in a context where tariffs were being levied on electronic deliveries as opposed to saying that that revenue was actually being lost.","WTCOMTDM36.pdf","Brazil, WTO, Geneva, Doha, Ministerial, Declarations, UNCTAD, Secretariat"
"3634",3634,"73","73.      The representative of UNCTAD said, in response to the question posed by the representative of the United States, that there were some similarities and some differences between the World Bank and the UNCTAD studies. More of less the same limited number of product categories had been used in both. However, the UNCTAD Secretariat had used a slightly different classification code for its calculations which had allowed it to separate software products from other products. The UNCTAD Secretariat calculations also included a larger number of countries, in particular more developing countries, than had been included in the World Bank study. Furthermore, apart from the tariff calculations, the UNCTAD Secretariat had added another database to calculate other customs surcharges and import taxes on those products. The UNCTAD Secretariat had not only calculated the potential tariff revenue losses but also those that could occur if additional surcharges levied on imports were taken into account as well. Regarding the question from the delegation of Brazil, she said that the UNCTAD Secretariat had wished to include not only the tariffs, but also the other duties. That was why the Study included both an analysis of information on tariffs only and an extended analysis including other duties that could be foregone, as those other duties would not be collected either if the products were imported digitally. It had been unclear what kind of duties the WTO Moratorium included; if it was limited to tariffs or if it had a broader reach. That would probably have to be looked into in the future. As far as the products were concerned, the UNCTAD Secretariat was happy to provide delegations with the other, more detailed study and would provide further information on the different calculations and more country and commodity details. The representative of Brazil was correct in that the calculations represented upper-level potential losses and did not claim to represent actual losses today. In addition, the figures were based on 1999 actual imports.","WTCOMTDM36.pdf","UNCTAD, United, States, World, Bank, UNCTAD, UNCTAD, Secretariat, Secretariat, World, Bank, UNCTAD, Secretariat, UNCTAD, Secretariat, Brazil, UNCTAD, Secretariat, WTO, UNCTAD, Secretariat, Brazil"

A revised version, contained in document WT/COMTD/W/92, had been before the Committee at its last meeting. While there had not been any objections to the content, some delegations had believed that the CTD should wait for the 4th Ministerial Conference before moving ahead with the work programme. He therefore hoped that delegations were in a position to consider the draft work programme in the CTD. The work programme was of course without prejudice to any decision the General Council might take with respect to the overall WTO Work Programme on Electronic Commerce. The draft work programme for the CTD outlined work the Committee could pursue in respect of the development implications of e-commerce and it also suggested the format such work could take. As he had said before, he believed that the work programme should be flexible enough to take account of requests from the General Council and individual Members as well as opportunities to invite speakers who happened to be in Geneva.","WTCOMTDM36.pdf","Chairman, CTD, Committee, CTD, General, Council, WTO, Work, Programme, CTD, Committee, General, Council, Members, Geneva"

She suggested that there also be a reference to the CTD continuing its work consistent with the mandate approved by the Ministers. Her delegation recognized that the issues presented in the draft CTD Work Programme were issues raised by different Members in the interest of seeing them taken up in the course of seminars.

He reminded Members that, at that occasion, his delegation's understanding had been that the list of issues to be considered under the Work Programme at the regular meetings of the CTD would be open-ended and that any delegation therefore could bring up any issue of interest to them. He noted, with respect to seminars, that revenue implications was one of the horizontal issues taken up in the General Council. He reiterated that Members should participate in the drawing up of the agenda for the seminars so that the process be as Member-driven as possible. He had some concerns with the wording of paragraph 4 of the Work Programme which stated that the results of the seminars be ""fed back into the regular work of the WTO. It would therefore be natural to report to the CTD from the various seminars held under its auspices."" His delegation's understanding was that that did not mean that any conclusions drawn at the seminars would be formally incorporated into the minutes or a formal discussion of the CTD regarding e-commerce.","WTCOMTDM36.pdf","Brazil, Work, Programme, Members, Work, Programme, CTD, General, Council, Members, Work, Programme, WTO, CTD, CTD"

Although she recalled that the delegation of Brazil had made similar comments earlier, Members had also said that if a particular delegation wished to make reference to something that had been learned from an expert at a seminar, that delegation could bring up that topic for discussion at its own responsibility into the regular discussions of the CTD. Delegations would not be barred from taking advantage of export information provided during seminars. There would otherwise not be any use of holding seminars.

That draft Work Programme was based on the existing work of the Committee. At the same time, it was clear that as a result of the 4th Ministerial Conference the WTO had a great deal of additional development-related work to do. Not all that work would be carried out in the Committee on Trade and Development. Some areas were mentioned as falling under the aegis of other WTO bodies such as work on small economies, trade, debt and finance and trade and transfer of technology which would be carried out under the General Council. Paragraph 51 of the Ministerial Declaration dealt with developmental aspects of the negotiations. It was clear that the Committee on Trade and Development was named as the forum where development-related aspects of the negotiations should be identified and debated. In addition, he recalled that both the CTD and the Committee on Trade and Environment had been asked to do work in relation to sustainable development. It was clear that that work covered elements of sustainability and development and that the CTD next year would have to look at what those concerns were. That work might require cooperative efforts among Members and the Secretariat on both development and environment issues. In addition to the identified areas, the CTD might be involved in reviewing and assessing the overall WTO Work Programme and a particular role might be envisaged for the CTD in relation to the expanded programme for technical assistance and capacity building. The Work Progamme therefore necessarily had to be flexible.","WTCOMTDM36.pdf","Chairman, Work, Programme, Committee, WTO, Committee, on, Trade, and, Development, WTO, General, Council, Committee, on, Trade, and, Development, CTD, Committee, on, Trade, and, Environment, CTD, Members, Secretariat, CTD, WTO, Work, Programme, CTD"

The representative of the European Communities said that it might be useful for delegations to pay attention to the footnote of the Work Programme which stated that the Work Programme was ""without prejudice to any additional work that may result from the work programme established by the Fourth Ministerial Conference"". A structure for the negotiations was being developed and it was unclear how it all would fit together and where individual pieces of work would be undertaken. Examples of that were issues such as small economies and special and differential treatment. A disclaimer was therefore necessary and issues such as the two examples given might have to be looked at when it was clear how the CTD should address those issues. In addition, the CTD might wish to make some input into the Rio Plus Ten Conference which so far only had been discussed under the Committee on Trade and Environment. It should be kept in mind that that conference treated the issue of development as well and might entail some future work for the CTD for coherence and policy consistency reasons. There was a footnote with respect to seminars in the Work Programme and it should be clear that the Committee could come back to that if necessary.

The remaining costs, for example maintenance, staff, electricity, water and waste disposal, are covered by the Infoplaza administrative partner. By the end of this period, each centre must be self-sufficient, and no longer receives support from the Infoplazas Foundation. This self-sufficiency must be achieved through the income earned from the services provided to the communities.

"3673",3673,"10","10.     Deputy Director-General Mr. Paul-Henri Ravier introduced the Secretariat-wide Plan for Technical Assistance in 2002. He requested Members' comments and guidance as the implementation of the Plan proceeded with the delivery of the activities. The activities contained in the Plan were operational activities based on mandates already established by Ministers, Decisions taken by the Membership in various Committees and Councils, and demands by the Membership. The Doha Ministerial Declaration confirmed that technical cooperation and capacity-building were core elements of the development dimension of the multilateral trading system. Ministers had established                                                                                   WT/COMTD/M/37                                                                                           Page 3 an extensive mandate and had undertaken a firm set of commitments on technical cooperation and capacity building to enable beneficiary countries to implement WTO rules and obligations, and prepare them for effective participation in the work of the WTO, including for future negotiations and an extensive Work Programme, as well as enable them to draw on the benefits of the multilateral trading system. Document WT/COMTD/W/95 outlined the Coordinated WTO Secretariat Annual Technical Assistance Plan for 2002 and contained the activities the WTO Secretariat could deliver within its area of competence, resources, and what was possible within an 11-month period. The Plan had been subjected to the fullest possible internal coordination by the WTO Secretariat Technical Assistance Management Committee (TAMC) which had been established last year. It was also based on information available to the Secretariat, under the time constraints post-Doha given the fact that implementation was to begin that month. The activities in the Plan were based on inputs from five sources, namely: (i) mandates on technical cooperation and capacity building in the Doha Ministerial Declaration as contained in paragraphs 16, 21, 24, 26, 27, 33, 38-40, 42 and 43; (ii) the New Strategy for WTO Technical Cooperation for Capacity-building, Growth and Integration – which was noted by the October 2002 CTD Meeting and endorsed by Ministers in paragraph 38 of the Doha Declaration; (iii) requests from the Membership and countries in accession to the WTO Secretariat. Such inputs into the Plan took into account the fact that WTO Technical Assistance remained demand driven; (iv) the stand-alone decisions on technical cooperation taken by Members such as in paragraph 14 of the Negotiating Guidelines for the Services Negotiations, the Decision on Technical Assistance by the Customs Valuation Committee, and others; and (v) coordinated inputs from operational divisions and the Technical Cooperation Division, which emerged from meetings of the TAMC.","WTCOMTDM37.pdf","Director-General, Paul-Henri, Ravier, Members, WTO, WTO, WTO, Secretariat, WTO, Secretariat, WTO, Secretariat, Technical, Assistance, Management, Committee, Secretariat, WTO, WTO, Secretariat, WTO, Members, Customs, Valuation, Committee, Technical, Cooperation, Division, TAMC"
"3674",3674,"11","11.      He went on to emphasise that with respect to the budgetary and financial aspects of the Plan, the cost had not yet been fully assessed. In principle however, the cost should not exceed the 15 million CHF which had been agreed to in the Committee on Budget and Finance. That figure depended on parameters such as the sensitive issue of cost-sharing with other organisations with which the WTO Secretariat cooperated and the number of participants to be invited from each Ministry. Once the financing of the programme had finally been determined, a statement would be made by the Secretariat. He drew the CTD's attention to the fact that the Plan was only one of four levels of action that the WTO Secretariat would pursue in the implementation of the technical cooperation and capacity building objectives in 2002. The other levels of action, which would be pursued interdependently were: (i) effective coordinated delivery of technical assistance with well-defined inter-agency groups/multilateral agencies. That would focus on areas such as the Singapore Issues, and areas where synergies would be required with other multilateral institutions; (ii) the Integrated Framework (IF) for Trade-Related Technical Assistance to the Least-Developed Countries (LDCs). Action at that level would be based on the re-vamped Integrated Framework as a mechanism for mainstreaming trade priority areas of action into the development plans and strategies for poverty reduction of the LDCs; and (iii) effective coordinated delivery of technical assistance by the WTO and bilateral donors through interaction with the Development Assistance Committee (DAC) of the OECD.","WTCOMTDM37.pdf","Committee, on, Budget, and, Finance, WTO, Secretariat, Ministry, Secretariat, CTD, WTO, Secretariat, Singapore, Integrated, Framework, LDCs, WTO, Development, Assistance, Committee, OECD"
"3675",3675,"12","12.      He then indicated that the Plan was divided into six sections, as they appeared in document WT/COMTD/W/90/Add.1. In view of the importance attached in the Ministerial Declaration to the Singapore issues, Annex I was dedicated to these issues. That Annex explained the overarching strategy underpinning the Singapore issues, and showed how technical assistance would be delivered in those areas, including in coordination with other competent agencies. Annex II was dedicated to trade and environment, in light of the negotiations agreed by Members. Paragraph 5 of the Introduction highlighted the areas of action covered in light of the Doha mandates, namely: (i) mainstreaming and Integrated Framework;            (ii) implementation issues and concerns; (iii) enhancing negotiating capacity;      (iv) trade-policy capacity-building;      (v) accessions; (vi) non-residents; (vii) WTO reference centres and information technology support; and (viii) modernization and expansion of technical assistance tools. He appealed to Members to limit ad hoc requests throughout the year. He noted that some planned activities would be cancelled or postponed, WT/COMTD/M/37 Page 4 while others would be ad hoc. He said that the CTD would recall the difficulties involved in ensuring an appropriate balance in the management of technical assistance, when the ratio between the planned activities and the ad hoc activities was unbalanced. In the 1980s and 1990s the ad hoc activities had represented a higher proportion than the planned activities, with the result that they had become difficult to organise. Since the number of planned activities in 2002 (422 in total) significantly exceeded the levels for previous years, the Secretariat would attach priority to planned activities, and would seek the cooperation and understanding of Members to ensure adherence to the Annual Plan. He clarified that ad hoc requests and activities that arose or were requested by Members throughout the year 2002 would be considered for the 2003 Plan, except when the most exceptional of circumstances would justify financing and integrating them into the 2002 activities. In concluding he urged the Members to be foresighted, and think of the next 3-4 years. In order to get the maximum benefit from the scarce financial and human resources, it was important to follow the plan agreed to at the beginning of the year. A flood of ad hoc activities would take up too much time and resources and would upset the balance of activities planned.","WTCOMTDM37.pdf","Singapore, Singapore, Members, Doha, WTO, Members, CTD, Secretariat, Members, Members, Members"
"3676",3676,"13","13.      The representative of Canada thanked the Secretariat for the immense amount of work devoted to the preparation of the documents that the CTD had before it and indicated that her delegation understood how complex the process was when five separate sets of activities had to be brought together to create the Plan. Her delegation recommended that the Plan be more closely identified with the activities linked to the Doha commitments. That linkage could be made, although it might not be easy since activities related to several different commitments. However, that was important from a strategic perspective, and would allow the Committees to relate to the Plan, analyse the Plan and understand the Plan as it related to their areas of expertise.","WTCOMTDM37.pdf","Canada, Secretariat, CTD, Doha"
"3677",3677,"14","14.      The representative of Switzerland indicated that his delegation would do its best to assist the Technical Cooperation Division in its difficult task. The WTO was not meant to be a development organisation, but there was a need for the WTO to provide technical assistance and build capacity in developing countries. He further reported that in a joint meeting of the OECD (DAC) and the Inter-Agency Working Group of the IF the previous week, the Chairman of the OECD Trade Committee had emphasised that capacity-building efforts in the WTO were of paramount importance for the further development of the multilateral trading system. Trade-related technical assistance had to take place in the WTO. The OECD Trade Committee, chaired by Switzerland, wished to convey to the CTD that it would follow those activities with interest and would be as supportive as possible. To be effective and efficient, the fullest possible transparency regarding the delivery of technical assistance was necessary. The report on capacity building that the Director-General would prepare for the General Council at the end of the year and for the next Ministerial Conference should not only present the activities at the multilateral level, but also those at the bilateral level. A compendium should also be prepared in collaboration with the relevant international organisations and donor countries on all trade-related technical assistance. With respect to Annex I of the 2002 Plan, he indicated that a focussed and enhanced technical assistance plan in the field of trade and investment, was to be discussed, and UNCTAD should be invited to participate in that process. He indicated that he had been informed that UNCTAD had already made a first draft of a post-Doha technical assistance proposal in the area of investment. He asked whether the WTO investment activities proposed in the 2002 Plan were coordinated with UNCTAD as his delegation would not wish to see similar activities conducted in parallel in both organisations. On the issue of transparency, he enquired whether there were country-specific lists which summarised the trade-related technical assistance activities delivered in the past. Such detailed lists by activity would be useful and he asked the Secretariat to prepare such lists in the future, in collaboration with other organisations. His delegation agreed with the Deputy Director-General's comment that ad hoc requests should only be met in exceptional circumstances. For full transparency with respect to ad hoc requests, he proposed that the Secretariat list the countries making such requests together with the subject area of their requests. He did not believe that the point had been reached where stand-alone technical activities were being turned into long-term sustainable and effective capacity-building. What was needed was                                                                                      WT/COMTD/M/37                                                                                              Page 5 to put in place a process for comprehensive trade-related capacity-building and move away from individual activities. He noted that the technical assistance strategy contained some elements that might assist, such as the coordinating committees at the country-level, or interlocking trade policy reviews with the design of country-specific capacity building. Those were future pursuits. The evaluation of the activities should also be part of transparency and effectiveness.","WTCOMTDM37.pdf","Switzerland, Technical, Cooperation, Division, WTO, WTO, OECD, Inter-Agency, Working, Group, Chairman, OECD, Trade, Committee, WTO, WTO, OECD, Trade, Committee, Switzerland, CTD, Director-General, General, Council, UNCTAD, UNCTAD, WTO, UNCTAD, Secretariat, Director-General, Secretariat"
"3678",3678,"15","15.     The representative of the Uruguay said that he had appreciated the initiative by the Secretariat to meet with regional groups to present the Plan for 2002. GRULAC was one of the groups that had benefitted from direct contact with the Secretariat. That contact had allowed them to get advance knowledge of the document and send it to their capitals in a timely manner. He hoped that that practice would continue in the future. His delegation thanked the Secretariat for including a national seminar on services in Uruguay, in the list of activities for the current year. He noted the position of the Secretariat to avoid ad hoc technical assistance requests. The 422 activities already planned for 2002 clearly showed that there was a significant planning for 2002. However, he reserved his delegation's right to make new technical assistance requests as necessary, bearing in mind the large agenda which arose from the fourth Ministerial Conference. There would be a national seminar on competition policy in Uruguay in the first half of the year 2002, in conjunction with other organisations. Bearing in mind what was stated in Annex I of the Plan with respect to capacity building and technical assistance in relation to the Singapore issues, he requested the support of the WTO Secretariat in planning that seminar.","WTCOMTDM37.pdf","Uruguay, Secretariat, Secretariat, Secretariat, Uruguay, Secretariat, Uruguay, Singapore, WTO, Secretariat"
"3679",3679,"16","16.     The representative of Malaysia understood the work on the Plan to be a complex exercise involving the coordination and cooperation between multilateral agencies considering requests from Members as well as giving the appropriate focus to LDCs. There was a broad mix in the delivery of technical assistance between the regions and he welcomed the fact that there were a number of regional workshops which would include the participation of Members which may otherwise not be included because of a lack of priority or because of a lack of funds. In this context, he noted that there were a number of venues that were used more frequently than others, possibly because the coordinating agencies were based in those countries. However, whenever possible, regional seminars and workshops should be hosted in other locations. A better spread of venues should be encouraged, so as to provide opportunities to additional Members to enhance their participation in the seminars. He further noted that the funding of the programmes was still pending, and would welcome pledges from donors to the Global Trust Fund so that those activities would be fully funded.","WTCOMTDM37.pdf","Malaysia, Members, Members, Members, Global, Trust, Fund"
"3680",3680,"17","17.       The representative of India agreed with the statement of the Chairman with respect to Mr. Tulloch who had been the ""Development Pillar"" of the Institution. It was unfortunate that he had left just after Doha. He stated his deep appreciation for Mr. Tulloch's valuable contribution. He went on to say that after Doha, many delegations had announced that the ""Doha Development Agenda"" had been launched. However, soon after returning from Doha delegations had discovered that the WTO Secretariat's Development Division had been liquidated, although its work had not gone away. It had been distributed between three WTO Secretariat Divisions. Despite that reorganisation, the Plan had been put together in a short time. His delegation had argued strongly in favour of two Geneva Weeks in the Budget Committee, and that had been included in the Plan. However, to the best of his knowledge, only one Geneva Week had been approved in the Budget Committee. He therefore wished to know if only one of the Weeks would be funded by the regular budget and how the other would be financed. Irrespective of the number of Geneva Weeks actually held, a way had to be found to keep the non-resident delegations constantly informed of progress in the various negotiations launched in Doha. His second point had to do with the meaning of capacity-building. He was of the view that capacity-building went beyond the holding of seminars. He acknowledged that seminars and regional workshops were valuable inputs into capacity-building, but noted that capacity-building extended far beyond those. The capacities of developing countries varied vastly and the programmes designed should cater to the specific needs of each beneficiary country. Developing countries did not have infinite capacity to absorb technical assistance. Their capacity had to be built up slowly, and WT/COMTD/M/37 Page 6 would involve the building up of capacities from scratch on certain issues. The pace of expansion of WTO activities, on specific subjects on which developing countries did not have adequate experience, should be so planned to allow all developing countries to effectively participate in the negotiations. He recommended the consideration of the delivery of technical assistance through institutions in other countries, particularly developed countries which had knowledge and expertise in development-related issues and had specialised in topics such as international trade and economic relations, as that might be a cost-effective way of delivering technical assistance. The training of trainers would have a multiplier effect since the trainers trained from developing countries would go back and train a significant number of persons in their own countries.","WTCOMTDM37.pdf","India, Chairman, Tulloch, Doha, Tulloch, Doha, Doha, WTO, Secretariat, 's, Development, Division, WTO, Secretariat, Geneva, Weeks, Budget, Committee, Geneva, Week, Budget, Committee, Geneva, Weeks, Doha, WTO"
"3681",3681,"18","18.      He went on to note that the Plan referred specifically to, and seemed to focus on the ""Singapore issues"". He was surprised to find reference to those in paragraph 5(iii) and the second sentence in Annex I of the document, as his delegation was not aware that negotiations on ""Singapore Issues"" had been agreed. He was of the view that that was to be discussed at the Fifth Ministerial Conference and to be decided on by explicit concensus. Similarly, with respect to mainstreaming and the IF in paragraph 5(i), there was a reference to paragraph 38 of the Doha Ministerial Declaration and his delegation preferred that the language used in the Plan be the same as that in the Declaration. It would otherwise give a misleading impression that something had been agreed to in Doha which had not been agreed to. The Doha Ministerial Declaration implied technical assistance in other areas, such as rules. He specifically referred to paragraphs 34, 35, 28 and 29. There was also an implied reference in paragraph 6 of the Declaration on Public Health which had to be taken into account, so that activities in those areas would be organised. In the final section of the Plan there was a provision for video-conferencing, which was useful. However, since the video-conferencing facilities were used by many Divisions, they should not be financed through the technical assistance budget, but be part of the regular budget. In Annex V of the Plan which summarised the number of activities planned for the year 2002, there was a column containing the number of activities planned for LDCs, which made impressive reading until the footnote was read. The footnote specified that LDC activities were ""Activities held in an LDC or, in the case of regional activities, those activities to which at least an LDC is invited."" If in a group of 30 participants, one participant represented an LDC, it could not be classified as an event for LDCs. He proposed that for group activities, only those where at least 50 per cent of the participants represented LDCs, should be identified as LDC activities, and that the figures be adjusted accordingly. He went on to say that it still was unclear where the required 15 million CHF was to come from. He hoped for an early decision on a Pledging Conference to held in early 2002. He said that he did not understand the Deputy Director-General's comment about cost-sharing with other organisations, since the activities being planned were within the WTO, and the cost should therefore be borne within the WTO. One of the previous speakers had mentioned that the WTO was not a development organisation, but it was not clear what that statement meant. If what was meant, was that the WTO could not assist in establishing infrastructure facilities, such as ports and roads, he could agree, but if the technical cooperation listed in the Plan was classified in that other context, he could not agree. In the pre-Doha phase, all delegations would recollect that when developing countries had made the point that they lacked expertise in the areas of investment and competition policy, they had been told not to worry as technical assistance and capacity building would be provided. If, after that, developing countries were told that the WTO was not a development organisation, it made his delegation wonder what the meaning of the earlier statement was. The technical cooperation and capacity-building activities listed in the Plan were relevant to the WTO's core-business and that assistance had to continue to be provided to developing countries and LDCs.","WTCOMTDM37.pdf","Singapore, Doha, Public, Health, Director-General, WTO, WTO, WTO, WTO, WTO, WTO"
"3682",3682,"19","19.     The representative of Djibouti noted that there was something new in the Plan, not previously seen in WTO documentation, specifically the names of the Secretariat staff who would be dealing with each activity. However, no telephone number were given. That information would assist delegations when they wished contact the officer responsible for a particular seminar. The aim of the technical assistance paragraphs of the Ministerial Declaration was to provide a means to developing                                                                                      WT/COMTD/M/37                                                                                              Page 7 countries and LDCs to prepare themselves to enter fully into the multilateral trading system. The 15 million CHF was therefore needed to ensure the implementation of the technical cooperation activities and to train people to comply with the obligations. The IF had developed well. However, he was not aware of the results of the three pilot countries. His government was willing to host a round table and to have an expert to prepare the round table.","WTCOMTDM37.pdf","Djibouti, WTO, Secretariat, LDCs"

He stated that, the CTD normally elected its Chairperson at the end of the first meeting of the year; however, the Chairman of the General Council was still in the process of holding consultations on the slate of officers for the different WTO bodies and he would report on the situation at an appropriate time at a meeting of the General Council. The Chairman of the CTD therefore suggested that the Committee elect its chairperson for 2002 at its next regular session scheduled for 14 February 2002, as the Chairmanship of the CTD could not be decided independently of the overall election of officers. He further proposed to place the election of a new chairperson as the first substantial item on the Agenda of that meeting in order to allow the incoming chairperson to chair the main part of the second meeting of the year as was the practice.","WTCOMTDM37.pdf","Chairman, CTD, Chairperson, Chairman, General, Council, WTO, General, Council, Chairman, CTD, Committee, CTD"
"3684",3684,"20","20.      The representative of the European Communities said that his delegations' remarks, while suggesting improvements, should not to be taken as if his delegation did not fully appreciate the difficulties involved in the work completed. It was in his delegation's self interest to get the Plan right, as the Doha Agreement was so focused on technical assistance and capacity building, that the success or failure of the whole exercise to a large extent would be measured by what was reflected in, for example, paragraph 41 of the Doha Ministerial Declaration, from which it was clear that there had to be a stocktaking of the adequacy of the measures undertaken. The main improvement his delegation suggested was to make it clear how the Plan fitted into the new framework under which the WTO was working. The Doha Ministerial Declaration and the Technical Cooperation Strategy had been mentioned in the introduction to the Plan. The Strategy Document was also reflected, in some elements, in certain relevant paragraphs, especially paragraphs 38-41 of the Doha Ministerial Declaration. Unfortunately, the Plan still looked somewhat like the lists which had been circulated in 2001 although the imperative was to respond to paragraphs 38-41, and be able to show how the development and technical assistance challenges would be responded to by the work of the WTO Secretariat and by bilateral and multilateral donors. It might therefore not be enough to report that a regional seminar had been conducted as outlined in the first part of the Plan if it could not be tied into specific obligations to provide technical assistance. Before a seminar was decided upon, it had to be considered whether it fitted into the development strategy of the recipient, as was clearly indicated in paragraph 38 of the Declaration, how it fitted into the Doha obligations and how it fitted with the main focus of the Technical Cooperation Strategy. Those considerations should have been the point of departure for the Plan, with more information as to how those objectives were to be met by the particular measures put forward. His delegation was aware that that was not an easy task as everything could not be classified from the start. However, the political value and visibility of the responsiveness of the Organisation lay in further working out those points. Some efforts had been made in that respect and he would be more positive and concrete with respect to these points. The Annexes on Investment and Environment of the Plan were based on subjects and the type of commitments taken in the Doha Ministerial Declaration. His delegation shared the view of the representative of Switzerland, that it was not clear what was WTO's work would be and questioned whether the WTO could organise the type of seminars outlined in the Plan. It was also not clear what UNCTAD's role would be. He asked if UNCTAD would organize seminars in which the WTO would participate, or whether the WTO would organise seminars in which UNCTAD would participate. His delegation also focussed on another main theme – cooperation and coordination with other multilateral organisations. The Deputy Director-General had pointed out that that was another level of the discussion, but the document discussed some of those issues as for example in the Annexes mentioned earlier and with respect to the IF. The more complementarity there could be, the better off everyone would be. He urged the Secretariat to try to expand the Plan a little in the direction of theme-oriented programmes, such as in the areas of investment and environment, for which the proposals were embryonic. In the area of the environment, for instance, a lot more had to be done to remove some of the concerns in the area and he urged the Secretariat to take up those themes.","WTCOMTDM37.pdf","European, Communities, WTO, Technical, Cooperation, Strategy, WTO, Secretariat, Doha, Organisation, Switzerland, WTO, WTO, UNCTAD, UNCTAD, WTO, WTO, UNCTAD, Director-General, Secretariat, Secretariat"
"3685",3685,"21","21.      He continued by saying that it was unclear how the costing process would operate. His delegation was not of the view that the Plan would cost more that 15 million CHF. He asked how priorities would be set if more costs were incurred through cooperation, since co-financing would not always be easy. Some programmes would hopefully be allocated to other international organisations who had more expertise, and more resources for the ""Singapore Issues"", for example. More clarity was needed in that area. In addition, delegations had to be informed about how much the WTO Secretariat could really deliver with its own resources. That would make the Plan a more credible WT/COMTD/M/37 Page 8 document and would help it respond to the challenges which the CTD faced. His delegation was looking forward to receiving an interim report to the General Council in December 2002. He was certain that the Organisation and the donors would be put to the test and asked what had been done. He therefore asked how it could be ensured that the words in the Ministerial Declaration had been turned into something tangible for developing countries. In order to be in the best possible position to give such a response, the Plan should be revised and rearranged along the lines suggested.","WTCOMTDM37.pdf","WTO, Secretariat, CTD, General, Council, Organisation"
"3686",3686,"22","22.      The representative of Paraguay agreed with the Plan and was grateful for the inclusion of three technical cooperation programmes which had been requested by his Government. He believed that the technical assistance provided by the WTO was a complement to the national training effort to meet the needs of multilateral trade at this time of globalisation. WTO technical cooperation was not a substitute for national efforts, but complemented them. Even if the Plan was not perfect, it contained aspects of the Doha decisions and requests from delegations. There had been progress in formulating the Plan and doors had been opened with other international institutions which dealt with similar matters. His delegation therefore supported the Plan.","WTCOMTDM37.pdf","Paraguay, WTO, WTO, Doha"
"3687",3687,"23","23.      The representative of the United States said that her delegation strongly supported the WTO's technical assistance agenda, and took a realistic approach to what Members agreed to at the Doha Ministerial Conference and the sentiments they all shared going into Doha concerning technical assistance and the integration of developing country Members into the multilateral trading system. Her Government had recently announced that it would submit 1 million US dollars to the new Global Trust Fund in an effort to begin the process to meet the objective that had been agreed to. With respect to the Secretariat Note she said that she had understood the Deputy Director-General to say that the CTD was being asked to adopt the ""Note by the Secretariat"". She therefore sought a procedural clarification as to what was to be done. She asked whether the intention was for the CTD to adopt the Secretariat Note or whether something more specific was to be adopted. She also stressed the need for coordination with other national and international organisations that provided technical assistance, as well as with other WTO bodies and Committees engaged in technical assistance activities. She was of the view that a number of the programmes and initiatives outlined did target specific agreement areas. Coordination was a priority in order to streamline and expedite the delivery of technical assistance. In the area of standards for example, as indicated in the Note, there were a number of international organisations that participated in seminars, and the same international organisations were working closely with the various standard-related Committees of the WTO. It was therefore important that there be tight coordination with the work of the other Committees. In order for the strategy to be effective, there had to be a focus on monitoring, auditing and evaluating the implementation of the technical assistance provided. She hoped that all of the projects that had been identified, including the specific seminars, focused on specific needs requested by the beneficiary countries. That comment also referred to the Work Plan for the ""Singapore Issues"" and she took note of the comments made by the representative of India with respect to the first paragraph on page 41. For any technical assistance issues linked to the Doha Declaration it had to be clear how the technical assistance was articulated in the Declaration. Her delegation expected that the projects in the Plan were linked to the various initiatives in the Doha Declaration. Her delegation sought more time to go through the Plan, which was one of four levels of technical assistance action. It would be kept in mind that the Plan described an evolving process and that as needs were identified and issues arose, it would be possible to accommodate those. She urged that there be coordination with other organisations that provided technical assistance and that bilateral donors would be actively involved.","WTCOMTDM37.pdf","United, States, WTO, Members, Doha, Ministerial, Conference, Doha, Members, Global, Trust, Fund, Secretariat, Note, Director-General, CTD, Secretariat, CTD, Secretariat, WTO, WTO, India"

"3689",3689,"25","25.     The representative of Japan said that the Introduction of the Plan stated that the Secretariat intended to link the capacity-building activities to the Doha commitments. However it was not clear                                                                                    WT/COMTD/M/37                                                                                            Page 9 to his delegation whether the activities proposed effectively reflected the intentions expressed in the Introduction. That was probably due to the complex nature of the comprehensive list of activities. His delegation hoped that the Secretariat was to make activities designed to create conducive environments to the implementation of Doha commitments by responding to the specific needs of specific countries. His second point referred to the Annex I of the Plan, which indicated that the Secretariat was going to plan activities in the sectors of investment and competition policy, based on the input of meetings to be held by the WTO. He hoped that, through this process, the WTO would coordinate closely with other donors and organisations, such as UNCTAD, in order to avoid unnecessary duplication, since the limited resources available had to respond to all the requested activities. He said that his final point was similar to that expressed by the representative of the European Communities with respect to the costing and priority issues.","WTCOMTDM37.pdf","Japan, Secretariat, Doha, Secretariat, Doha, Secretariat, WTO, WTO, UNCTAD"
"3690",3690,"26","26.      The representative of Australia welcomed the Secretariat efforts to implement the technical assistance mandate of the Doha Development Agenda as quickly as possible. She noted that the recent agreement to establish the Global Trust Fund put extra emphasis on the CTD's coordination of technical assistance and capacity building activities and looked forward to that proceeding. She said that her delegation appreciated the clarity of the Plan, in particular the eight policy frameworks under which the Plan was divided, and further elaborated in paragraph 5. With respect to paragraphs 6-10 of the Introduction, on the five additional points which were underlined by the Secretariat, she agreed with the determination to limit ad hoc technical assistance activities to the greatest extent possible. However, if some legitimate and urgent requests for technical assistance did arise unexpectedly, then some flexibility in implementing the Plan would be required. Nevertheless, previous experience had shown that meeting ad hoc requests diminished the Secretariat's ability to provide long-term targeted technical assistance. With a new mandate and heavy focus on developmental issues, the achievement of long-tem goals were a vital aspect of the Organisation's work and her delegation endorsed the comments made under paragraph 6.","WTCOMTDM37.pdf","Australia, Secretariat, Doha, Development, Agenda, Global, Trust, Fund, CTD, Secretariat, Secretariat, Organisation"
"3691",3691,"27","27.      The representative of Senegal noted that many activities concerning his country were retained in the Plan, based on the requests made, which in turn had been based on a needs-assessment. However, that there were perhaps some adjustments to be made concerning the priority given to the activities. Some of the requests would be retained and others would not, in terms of their priority. Those might be handed into the Secretariat. He sought clarification from the Secretariat as to whether the Joint Integrated Technical Assistance Programme for Selected Least-Developed and other African Countries (JITAP) was to be completed at the end of 2002. Many developing countries had insisted that it be maintained and extended. There were currently eight countries involved, and he wished to know what would happen since there had been many references to Senegal under the JITAP Programmes, and to other countries as well. He enquired whether the Programme would be maintained, since initially there had been references of a ""second generation JITAP"". He therefore wished to know the exact future content of the Programme. His second point related to Information Technologies and the WTO Reference Centres. WTO technical assistance had to assist Geneva-based delegations maintain contact with their capitals. He did not know whether that could be done under the SITA as indicated on page 36 of the Plan. It was clear that it was important to install reference centers in capitals, but it would always be difficult for developing country delegations to carry out their tasks as long as a functioning link was not established between the Geneva missions and their capitals. The missions obviously used classical means of communication. However, it would be useful if they could use modern information technology tools to become more effective. He therefore requested more information on the SITA. He further recalled that a presentation of how a small Geneva-based developing country mission could use modern information technology tools had been made by the Ambassador of Panama. The Ambassador had demonstrated extremely interesting methods of work. That type of sharing of experiences should be increased as it enabled developing countries to learn from other delegation's experiences with coordination and contacts with capitals. There was currently a limit of 15 million CHF for WTO technical assistance and the Director-General had said that the financial programme would be further elaborated. His delegation hoped that the WT/COMTD/M/37 Page 10 WTO would be able to get the necessary resources to finance its activities, especially so as some delegations were of the view that the 15 million CHF was not sufficient.","WTCOMTDM37.pdf","Senegal, Secretariat, Secretariat, Joint, Integrated, Technical, Assistance, Programme, Senegal, Information, Technologies, WTO, WTO, SITA, Geneva, SITA, Ambassador, Panama, Ambassador, WTO, Director-General, WTO"

The representative of Madagascar asked the Secretariat to make a greater effort to get translations out more rapidly, since her delegation only had received the French translation that morning. However, her delegation hoped that that would not be a problem for much longer since the Director-General had indicated that additional funds of 850,000 CHF had been earmarked for the translation services, in addition to the 1.5 million CHF allocated last year, as had been requested for a long time by non-English speaking delegations. She expressed the hope that the programmes which had been established would not prevent her delegation from making further requests for technical assistance in the course of the year, as needs arose.","WTCOMTDM37.pdf","Madagascar, Secretariat, Director-General"

She hoped that the Secretariat would consider holding at least one of those activities in Bolivia.

"3695",3695,"30","30.      The representative of Norway said that his Government attached importance to the developmental aspects of the WTO agenda post-Doha. Firstly, there was a need to avoid ad hoc requests, as they were not the best way to accommodate the needs of Members. Secondly, the Plan lacked an elaboration of how coordination with other organisations would be carried out, and requested the Secretariat to briefly comment on that aspect. Thirdly, the Secretariat had indicated an interest in presenting an IF-process for non-LDCs, similar to the current IF programme. Such a process had to be demand-driven and there had to be a close dialogue between donors and recipients. He noted that in Section I of the Plan, 158 regional seminars and multilateral conferences were planned. Given the high number of activities, he wished to know whether they were based on evaluations of previous seminars and conferences. He noted that there was a wide geographical spread and indicated that if there was a need to trim the number of activities, LDCs should be given priority. There were less activities planned with respect to trade-related capacity building in Section II. As to Section III of the Plan, on technical assistance related to the WTO Agreements, which normally would be the core business of the WTO, he recognised that there was a wide geographical spread in terms of beneficiary countries and queried the inclusion of some of the more well-off developing countries. He further asked whether self-payment for those countries had been considered and whether visits by Committee Chairs to countries seeking accession would be covered by the Fund. His final question was whether the activities related to the thirteen countries, which were also included in the IF Programme, would be funded by the IF fund or the Global Trust Fund.","WTCOMTDM37.pdf","Norway, WTO, Members, Secretariat, Secretariat, LDCs, WTO, WTO, Committee, Chairs, Global, Trust, Fund"
"3696",3696,"31","31.      The representative of Lesotho said that his delegation found the Plan adequate for what it considered as a priority. He supported the view that there was a need to highlight the assistance or work being undertaken at the bilateral level to avoid overlaps. Cooperation between the donors and the recipient states was therefore important. With respect to ad hoc requests, his delegation noted the comments of previous speakers on the need to limit them. However, for most countries, in particular developing countries and LDCs, the process of analysing the outcome and the implications of the Doha Work Programme was ongoing, and there was therefore a need to provide alternate allowances for countries to supplement the requests that they had originally submitted to the Secretariat to reflect their improved understanding of the implications of the Doha Conference. The Secretariat should be given the flexibility to assist countries when they submitted such requests, while recognising that this should not be the regular route. With respect to the need for improved coordination with other organisations such as UNCTAD, he indicated that his delegation had been in contact with UNCTAD                                                                                    WT/COMTD/M/37                                                                                           Page 11 to discuss how to implement the Doha Work Programme. The UNCTAD Secretariat had made suggestions on how to address some of the issues. The work that had already been started had to be taken into account when considering the Programmes that were now being embarked on in the WTO. His final point related to the coordination with regional economic bodies. When regional seminars were undertaken there should be maximum coordination with those bodies to ensure that coverage and priorities identified by the region were reflected in the Work Programme. He proposed that, at the end of the meeting, the CTD take note of the report to enable its implementation.","WTCOMTDM37.pdf","Lesotho, Doha, Work, Programme, Secretariat, Secretariat, UNCTAD, UNCTAD, Doha, Work, Programme, Secretariat, WTO, Work, Programme, CTD"
"3697",3697,"32","32.      The representative of the Philippines said that the activities in the Plan were part of the process of development, and the WTO technical assistance experience was not longer than that of other Geneva-based institutions. Nevertheless, the tables gave a good view of the broad scope of the activities, objectives and coverage of WTO technical assistance, without indicating the quality of the outcome. That was something that had to be developed. He hoped that those who had serious interests in technical assistance would focus and pay more attention to the capacity, and later to the consolidation and quality-control of the 442 activities. He said that he had a side comment regarding the statement that the WTO was not a development organisation. He would no longer object to that type of statement, because, as he had understood from the respresentative of India, the development perceptions of most of the delegations were for ""hard"" infrastructure including roads, bridges and irrigation. The technical assistance the WTO could provide was in terms of ""soft"" infrastructure such as the human capital and the institutions that would allow developing countries to achieve the objectives of their development. That was the objective of the CTD. With respect to the tables, his delegation believed that the Secretariat had done a good job as far as the balance of activities, objectives and regional distribution were concerned. His delegation was satisfied with the planned activities by regions, as indicated on page 47. However, in the individual presentations there were indications of various activities for which dates were to be confirmed, which he knew meant that the activities were either not funded, or not definite. He therefore still had a problem with respect to the prioritising being made on the basis of the budgetary resources available. He hoped that the case of the LDCs, as stated by the representative of India, would be taken into consideration, and indicated that a number of consultations also had to be undertaken with the prospective recipients, to allow the WTO to respond to their legitimate objectives with the technical assistance provided. For example, his delegation did not see SMC–issues as concrete activities since there were to be consultations on the kind of technical assistance that would be needed during the first month of 2002. He enquired whether it was being undertaken by the WTO or whether it was being done within the context of UNCTAD's work. He noted that there had been regional discussions with UNCTAD, and that UNCTAD had plans for a broad approach to the requirements of the Doha Development Agenda in the areas of investment, competition policy, and trade facilitation. The objectives of UNCTAD were broad, as was its membership. UNCTAD therefore had to conform to the desires and objectives of its membership. With respect to the fourth sentence of the first paragraph on page 41, it was implied that the ""Singapore Issues"" had already been agreed to in negotiations, and that the focus of the work therefore was on addressing the negotiating elements. In his view it was far broader than that. The issue had been addressed by some delegations in the Informal Group of Developing Countries, and the Secretariat had responded that it would look at it. He stressed that since it was an evolving process, each activity should be analysed in terms of its outcome, and be incorporated into a cross- sectoral analysis from the perspective of the Membership with a view to seeing if there was need for more training tools, more outreaches to regions and institutions and more training and capacity building. If the analysis was done in the regions, by the Members, rather than from the perspective of persons based in Geneva, the training courses could be improved. A new set of programmes would be developed in 2003, and there should then be close consultations with the prospective beneficiaries of the training courses, in order to ensure that it would be useful to them with respect to their WTO obligations. The matrix should also be viewed in the context of technical assistance from other Geneva-based institutions, banking and international financial institutions, which hoped to achieve similar objectives, so that the IF principle, which was a good one, could be achieved as far as the type and quality of the WTO's technical assistance programmes was concerned.

The representative of Guinea said that the number of activities planned for 2002 was an indication of the extent to which technical assistance was important to developing countries, especially LDCs, including Guinea. Her delegation had already forwarded its comments, with amendments, to the Technical Cooperation Division. She indicated that her Government wished to participate in the detailed technical assistance programme during 2002. As stated by the representative of Malaysia, her delegation also wished the countries selected to host the seminars to be more varied, to allow for more diversified participation in the seminars. Given the burden of work post-Doha, her delegation wished to approach the Secretariat about the seminar to be organised in Guinea, in coordination with the Technical Cooperation Division. With respect to cooperation with other organisations such as FAO and UNCTAD, her delegation had contacted them with a view to establishing a work-programme on post-Doha affairs in connection with their mandates. Her delegation invited the CTD to endorse the Plan, and invited all partners to finance the 15 million CHF needed for technical cooperation, in order to make progress in the short time available.","WTCOMTDM37.pdf","Guinea, Guinea, Technical, Cooperation, Division, Malaysia, Secretariat, Guinea, Technical, Cooperation, Division, UNCTAD"
"3699",3699,"34","34.      The representative of China said that he wished to take this first official opportunity, as a new Member, to express his delegation's thanks to the Secretariat for the technical assistance provided to China during the whole process of China's negotiations on its resumption of Contracting Party status, as well as in the few years of negotiations with the WTO on accession. His delegation believed that that technical assistance had been useful, not only for the projects offered to China over the years, but also the training courses which had been offered by the Secretariat to Chinese officials. For instance, many Chinese officials in charge of WTO affairs, except the speaker, had been trained by the Secretariat, particularly through the Trade Policy Courses. That was the case for the Director-General for the Department of International Relations, who had taken care of China's accessions negotiations over the past 15 years; the Director-General for the current Department of WTO Affairs of the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation (MOFTEC); and the Director-General for the newly established Fair Trade Bureau, which also dealt with WTO Affairs in MOFTEC. The seminars, workshops and advisory studies provided by the Technical Cooperation Division, which was currently headed by Mr. Osakwe, had also offered help to his delegation in its familiarisation with the rules of the WTO, and the strengthening of the negotiating capacity of his Government, mainly in its accession process. His delegation therefore believed that technical cooperation was important, not only to other developing countries, but also to China as a new developing Member.","WTCOMTDM37.pdf","China, Member, Secretariat, China, China, Contracting, Party, WTO, China, Secretariat, WTO, Secretariat, Director-General, Department, of, International, Relations, China, Director-General, Department, of, WTO, Ministry, of, Foreign, Trade, and, Economic, Cooperation, MOFTEC, Director-General, Fair, Trade, Bureau, WTO, MOFTEC, Technical, Cooperation, Division, Osakwe, WTO, China, Member"
"3700",3700,"35","35.      He went on to say that in paragraph 6 of the Plan, the Secretariat refered to a number of elements which his delegation considered important. The first point related to coordination. Coordination related to at least three levels. The first level of coordination, was coordination within the requesting members, for both national and regional projects. Requestors needed to have good internal coordination for their requests for technical cooperation from the Secretariat. His Government had coordinated internally in making requests to the Secretariat. Since China was such a large country with a population of 1.3 billion people, and more than 30 provinces and independent cities under the direct leadership of the central government, it would be difficult if everyone made individual requests to the Secretariat for technical assistance. It would be difficult not only for the Secretariat, but also for the Chinese Government. His delegation therefore believed that the coordination within the requesting parties was important to make full use of available human and financial resources, both of the Secretariat and of the requesting Members. The second area of coordination was the internal coordination of the Secretariat. He noticed that in Annex III of the Plan, the Secretariat had given a list of contact persons in different Divisions. He found that useful, but it did not mean that every Member should be encouraged to directly contact those officers for their technical cooperation projects, since, whenever an individual request was made directly to a particular person, that person responsible for a specific area of business in that Division, would sometimes respond directly to the requestor. That would confuse the situation and sabotage the coordination efforts of the Secretariat and the requesting Member. The final area of coordination related to the coordination between the WTO Secretariat and other international agencies. His delegation had found some references to the importance of coordination of that type in the Plan. It was stated that the WTO                                                                                     WT/COMTD/M/37                                                                                            Page 13 Secretariat was ready to strengthen that sort of coordination, not only to avoid duplication but also to promote mutual complementarity, and he encouraged the Secretariat to continue those efforts. In paragraph 6, the Secretariat also referred to the flexibility of the Plan and flexibility with respect to implementation. Flexibility was also important, given inter alia, the emergence of new Members, the applications for accessions, and the launch of the new Round. Rapid implementation of the Plan was therefore important. Finally, the Secretariat had rightly drawn the attention of Members to the fact that they should request as few ad hoc technical cooperation projects as possible, as that would sabotage the whole Plan if not properly managed. Ad hoc requests could not be avoided, but they should be kept to a minimum. He indicated that China wished to keep ad hoc requests to a minimum, although he could not guarantee that his country would never make such a request.","WTCOMTDM37.pdf","Secretariat, Secretariat, Secretariat, China, Secretariat, Secretariat, Secretariat, Members, Secretariat, Secretariat, Member, Secretariat, Member, WTO, Secretariat, WTO, Page, 13, Secretariat, Secretariat, Secretariat, Members, Secretariat, Members, China"

"3702",3702,"37","37.      The representative of Zambia said that the Plan, for his country as an LDC, lacked visibility of the wishes expressed by Ministers at Doha. Document WT/COMTD/W/90 stated that ""Although all developing countries are entitled to WTO technical assistance, Members however, have asked for priority to be accorded to the Least-Developed Countries, African countries, non-residents, and modest and capacity-constrained Missions."" That wish did not seem to have been reflected in the Plan, and he therefore asked for a section be included in the Plan, focusing on the special needs of LDCs, as had been identified in the Uruguay Round, at the Fourth Ministerial Conference, and in the document referred to. He thanked the representative of Norway for highlighting that point. He then sought clarification with respect to paragraph 2(iii), which dealt with the IF. What was referred to as the re-vamped IF was actually the pilot-IF which currently only concerned three countries. He enquired whether that meant that only those three countries would be considered as priority-countries. If that was not the case, he enquired how the Secretariat intended to operate in order for all other LDCs to be included. In the same paragraph, he was also concerned by what appeared to be a condition of mainstreaming trade, as an imposition of a conditionality for technical assistance. His delegation had always argued that the IF should address other trade-related technical assistance needs and should not highlight mainstreaming, as the condition to be met. Finally, the lack of focus and visibility on LDCs was also evident in the distribution of programmes. For instance, the LDCs had not received a sufficient number of programmes in Section III on national technical assistance programmes.","WTCOMTDM37.pdf","Zambia, Doha, WTO, Members, Uruguay, Round, Norway, Secretariat, LDCs"

He also thanked the donors that had announced contributions, and urged others to do so rapidly, since the success of the Plan and LDCs depended on their assistance. He also noted the apprehensions of the Secretariat, with respect to being overwhelmed by ad hoc activities, and therefore suggested that regional programmes should be complemented by national programmes. With respect to the multiplicity of activities foreseen, he agreed with the need to coordinate with other organisations such as UNCTAD. Despite the multiplicity of activities, the needs of LDCs were still not met. He enquired whether the confirmation of certain activities would be made by the Secretariat, the beneficiary countries, or during consultations.","WTCOMTDM37.pdf","Burundi, LDCs, Secretariat, UNCTAD, Secretariat"
"3704",3704,"39","39.      The representative of Belize said that with respect to enhancing negotiating capacity, paragraph 5(iii) of the document spoke to the ""Singapore Issues"", and trade and the environment. His delegation was of the view that that reference seemed to suggest that that Plan treated those issues at a higher level than the other issues. That was true when taken within the context of paragraph 38 of the Doha Ministerial Declaration, which called for ""technical assistance and capacity-building to support efforts for national plans for economic development and strategies for poverty reduction"". That should not be the case, since the reality was that many developing countries still suffered from negotiating capacity-deficits in other areas of trade of particular export-interest to them. With respect WT/COMTD/M/37 Page 14 to the nomenclature of the different activities within the Plan, he asked what the difference was between symposiums, seminars and workshops. He enquired whether they had different levels of importance and/or programme-content. If that was the case, he further enquired what the differences were in the benefits that would be derived to participants in the respective programmes. Paragraph 10 of the Plan called for the Secretariat and the Members to work together to ensure that technical assistance is delivered within a coherent policy framework. However, it made no suggestions with respect to how assessments of the benefits of the technical assistance and capacity-building efforts would be made. His delegation was of the view that this was critical for measuring the effectiveness of the programmes and determine what the future work plans should be. In closing, he joined the representative of India in expressing concern with respect to the comment that the WTO was not a development institution. His delegation did not suggest that it was a developing institution, but for many developing countries development assumed a trade-led approach. Given the resource and capacity-constraints of those countries, the importance of trade as a vehicle for development imbued the WTO with a certain dimension, if not personality, of development, and that could not be denied. To do so would undermine the so called ""Development Round"".","WTCOMTDM37.pdf","Belize, Secretariat, Members, India, WTO, WTO"

He therefore asked for LDC issues to be given more visibility and not be mixed with those of other developing countries. That should not be done at the expense of other developing countries, but given their position as LDCs and their well known capacity constraints, LDCs should be given more visibility. He indicated that the LDCs were willing to work with the Secretariat in the preparation of the final document, to ensure greater visibility and more LDC-focussed programmes.","WTCOMTDM37.pdf","Uganda, LDCs, LDCs, LDCs, Secretariat"

The representative of Ghana said that he sought a clarification with respect to the national technical assistance programmes listed for Ghana on page 23 - in the Topics column, ""WTO Agreements"". He recalled that his delegation had made some requests for technical assistance in the past, which might have included WTO Agreements. He asked if what was contained in the Plan was based on that request. He further noted that the Plan was targeted toward effectiveness in the upcoming negotiations, and his delegation did not need knowledge of WTO Agreements in general for that purpose. What was needed was specific technical assistance based on his Government's specific needs. He therefore enquired whether the Plan was finalised or whether it could be modified, as his delegation needed to identify the type of assistance it needed.","WTCOMTDM37.pdf","Ghana, Ghana, WTO, WTO"
"3708",3708,"42","42.      The representative of Morocco said that his delegation was of the view that the implementation of the Programme of Action in the area of technical assistance and capacity building augured well, given the greatly improved financial conditions and the different activities programmed. He believed that ad hoc requests should be permitted to allow some flexibility for developing countries, although they should be limited in number. With respect to Annex II, which dealt with the ""Singapore Issues"", Morocco had already, at a regional level, organised activities in those areas; specifically, the Euro-Mediterranean Conference on Competition Law, and a regional seminar on government procurement. Those had allowed for a better understanding of these complex issues. He indicated that his government would be willing to host a regional workshop on any of these issues, in which African countries and developing countries generally, still had a lot of work to do. His Government also renewed its offer to host a third study-cycle for Moroccan and African students on WTO-issues. One of the benefits from that type of activity was that it assisted the WTO in its overall training in the public and private sectors. With respect to the activities for 2002, his government was happy to host the two regional seminars which were being organised in Morocco on dispute settlement and trade policy in order to better understand the WTO Agreements, and assured the Secretariat that everything would be done by the organisers to have successful events.","WTCOMTDM37.pdf","Morocco, Morocco, WTO, Morocco, WTO, Secretariat"

The representative of Kenya said that technical assistance and capacity building were core elements of WTO's work, and indicated that it would be a mistake if the efforts already undertaken                                                                                     WT/COMTD/M/37                                                                                            Page 15 were not recognized. Success would depend on the level and quality of technical assistance provided to developing countries. He welcomed the planned activities, but wished to see some of the activities address the specific request to enhance his Government's negotiating capacity and skills on subjects, especially those specified in the Doha Declaration. His delegation was of the view that room should be made for counties to identify some of its more pressing needs. His delegation had already submitted its specific requirements to the Secretariat, and was willing to discuss it, to see where it would fit in the current planned activities. He requested a similar clarification with respect to JITAP as the representative of Ghana had requested.","WTCOMTDM37.pdf","Kenya, WTO, Secretariat, Ghana"

The representative of Indonesia said that his delegation supported the view of the delegation of Madagascar, that the WTO should permit Members to submit requests on issues and sectors which were not yet included in the Plan. With respect to Section III of the Plan on national technical assistance programmes, he requested the inclusion of his country in the 2002 Plan. His Government required technical missions under the WTO technical assistance programmes which aimed at a better understanding of the implications of the services negotiations, as well as issues initiated at Singapore, which were particular to the economic development of the country.","WTCOMTDM37.pdf","Indonesia, Madagascar, WTO, Members, WTO, Singapore"
"3713",3713,"47","47.      The representative of Jamaica recalled that at the Doha Ministerial Conference, Ministers had emphasised the critical importance of technical assistance and capacity building in facilitating the participation of developing and LDCs in the WTO Work Programme, including the broad based negotiations launched at Doha. To that end, eleven operative paragraphs of the Doha Declaration reflected the commitment to the provision of technical assistance. She drew attention to paragraph 38 of the Declaration, which stated that in the provision of technical assistance ""priority shall also be accorded to small, vulnerable, and transition economies, as well as to Members and Observers without representation in Geneva."" While her delegation recognised and applauded the efforts of the Secretariat in attempting to respond to the overwhelming demand for technical assistance from Members, her delegation was concerned with the way in which small economies were dealt with in the Plan. It was not clear how far the needs and concerns of those countries were being addressed, and an examination of the Plan suggested that work needed to be done to fulfill the mandate as identified in paragraph 38. For example, the Caribbean region included many small island developing countries, most of whom were non-resident members of the WTO. Those countries in particular, needed a range of technical assistance activities to be kept abreast of the work conducted in the WTO; to facilitate their participation in the WTO negotiations and to enhance their supply-side capabilities. However, most of the technical assistance activities, in which Jamaica would be involved, would be in the form of regional seminars and workshops, with minimum attention being paid to technical assistance at the national level. While the regional dimension of the WTO strategy was an important component, she indicated that the new strategy should recognise, as far as possible, the technical assistance requirements of individual countries within regions. While her government was fully committed to regional cooperation, and recognised the place of regional activities in the delivery of technical assistance, she drew attention to the fact that there were certain limitations to regional WT/COMTD/M/37 Page 16 seminars. For example, participation was usually limited to one or two officials from each country, which therefore placed a limit on the participation of the public sector and, in particular, the private sector. It was not easy to obtain the required level of private sector participation, since it was usually difficult for private sector participants to fund their own participation.","WTCOMTDM37.pdf","Jamaica, LDCs, WTO, Work, Programme, Doha, Members, Geneva, Secretariat, Members, Caribbean, WTO, WTO, WTO, Jamaica, WTO"
"3714",3714,"48","48.      She went on to say that her delegation also wished to know how far the three-year plans which had previously been submitted by Members, had been taken into account in the preparation of the 2002 Plan. She noted that the TAMC had been established to ensure the coordination and coherence of technical assistance activities within the Secretariat and between the WTO and other organisations. However, it was unclear how the TAMC prepared the Plan and the factors that had determined which activities were chosen. She suggested that, for the sake of transparency, the Secretariat give its rationale for the choice of activities in the Plan. She further indicated that it would be useful if the Secretariat indicated how the activities would be audited, to ensure that quality technical assistance was delivered and that the objectives of the technical cooperation strategy were being met. With respect to the coordinated delivery of technical assistance, she pointed out that in the new Plan, the Secretariat had underscored the need to improve its approach in the delivery of technical assistance by ensuring the effective, coordinated delivery of technical assistance in conjunction with inter-agency groups, bilateral donors and international organisations. That was a positive step, as technical cooperation with those bodies, particularly international organisations such as the World Bank, and the infra structural type technical assistance offered by those organisations would assist in addressing issues related to supply-side constraints faced by a number of LDCs and developing countries, including her own. With respect to the ""Singapore Issues"", she noted that Annex I did not clearly indicate how technical assistance in those areas would be approached. The Doha Declaration, with respect to the ""Singapore Issues"", had pointed out that a decision to launch negotiations on the modalities of the negotiations would be taken by explicit consensus by Members, at the Fifth Ministerial Conference. The emphasis placed on those issues within the Plan, should not be done in a manner that would appear to pre-judge the launching of the negotiations in those areas. She emphasised the need for secure and stable funding for the range of technical assistance activities planned for 2002 and beyond. The Work Programme launched at Doha was a challenging one, and as the Programme evolved and Members became more aware of their technical assistance needs either in relation to the negotiations or the programmes in the standing Councils and Committees, the demand for technical assistance and capacity building would increase. It was therefore imperative that adequate and stable funding be secured. Finally, she said that the Secretariat had indicated that it intended to adhere to the 2002 Plan, but that there would be some flexibility in its implementation, as Members would still be able to submit requests for additional technical assistance throughout the year. In response to the Secretariat's request that Members kept ad hoc requests to a minimum, her delegation still hoped that the Secretariat would look favourably upon such requests from Members.","WTCOMTDM37.pdf","Members, TAMC, Secretariat, WTO, Secretariat, Secretariat, Secretariat, World, Bank, Members, Work, Programme, Doha, Members, Secretariat, Members, Secretariat, Members, Secretariat, Members"
"3715",3715,"49","49.      The representative of St. Lucia indicated that her intervention would be from the perspective of non-residents. Thirty per cent of the WTO Membership were non-resident Members. The circumstances of the non-residents therefore required some sensitivity by the other Members for the challenges they faced. She thanked the delegation of India for indicating that the WTO needed to keep non-residents informed. She was under the impression that the WTO had approved two Geneva Weeks in the General Council and in the Committee on Budget and Administration, but that had to be clarified. With respect to capacity building, many of the previous interventions had focused on the need for targeted technical assistance in line with Members' development strategies. Part of the problem, as stated in many of the interventions, was to focus on the specific requests from Members, which almost locked them into a vicious circle of ignorance. A certain level of understanding of the WTO Agreements was required to make a specific request for technical assistance. For instance, St. Lucia was the only member of the Organisation of Eastern Caribbean States (OECS) featured in the Plan for any technical missions. She noted that the assistance was to be delivered through regional seminars, workshops, conferences and briefings, and her delegation sought a clarification similar to that of the representative of Belize on the differences between those. In addition, the assistance was at                                                                                    WT/COMTD/M/37                                                                                           Page 17 the Caribbean Community (CARICOM) or broader hemispheric level. She thanked the Secretariat for holding two of the CARICOM seminars in St. Lucia, as it gave her Government the opportunity to have more persons present. However, the absence of more targeted technical assistance was disappointing. It might be said that the Governments also bore responsibility for the absence of any activity specifically targeted towards the sub-region as they had not been proactive enough. She was in the process of finding out what requests had been made by the OECS countries, and at what level – whether regional, sub-regional or national. There were reasons why all six OECS Members, and other CARICOM Members, were non-resident. As small-island states with populations between 40,000 and 150,000 persons, the OECS countries had over-burdened administrations and often an insufficient understanding of the Uruguay Round obligations to appreciate their deficiencies, in order to make timely technical assistance requests. She therefore hoped that, as stated by the delegations of Madagascar, Lesotho and Jamaica, among others, the door remained opened for ad hoc technical assistance requests, and asked the Secretariat to be creative in the design and delivery of programmed assistance, and to use every occasion to reach out to non-residents. Her delegation's experience with respect to meeting the subsidy notification had shown the absence of knowledge and the lack of understanding of what had been undertaken during the Uruguay Round. It would be even more so for the new round of negotiations, as many small delegations would not be present to participate.","WTCOMTDM37.pdf","St., Lucia, WTO, Members, Members, India, WTO, WTO, Geneva, Weeks, General, Council, Committee, on, Budget, and, Administration, Members, Members, WTO, St., Lucia, Organisation, of, Eastern, Caribbean, States, OECS, Belize, Caribbean, Community, CARICOM, Secretariat, CARICOM, St., Lucia, OECS, OECS, Members, CARICOM, Members, OECS, Uruguay, Madagascar, Lesotho, Jamaica, Secretariat, Uruguay, Round"

The representative of Bulgaria said that with respect to the organisation of the seminars, he proposed that all basic documents and presentations from each seminar, symposium and round-table, whether at the regional or national level, for Geneva-based Missions or non-resident Members, be made available to all Members. An additional link on the WTO web page could be developed, where all those documents could be posted. That would allow all countries to have access to the documents, and it would facilitate him advising experts from his capital to source those materials. It was pointed out that UNCTAD was doing something similar with respect to the outcome of its Expert Meetings, and they might be able to explain how that was organised. That would also reduce rivalry within the WTO with respect to technical assistance, as it would not matter whether a session was held for LDCs or a specific region, as all Members would have access to the basic documents and presentations in written format.","WTCOMTDM37.pdf","Bulgaria, Members, Members, WTO, UNCTAD, WTO, Members"
"3718",3718,"51","51.     The representative of Mexico said that the issue of technical assistance was important to his delegation. He believed that technical assistance should be linked to the Doha Development Agenda, which in turn should be linked to all the activities of the WTO and its different Agreements. Technical assistance within the WTO should take into consideration the greater creation of supply in developing countries. He said that he was happy to see that his country was included in the 2002 Plan with the workshop on safeguards. He had also taken note of the comments made, that the Plan would be applied throughout the year, although it might be adjusted in the future, as the Programme evolved and as changes were introduced according to the needs of the WTO Members.","WTCOMTDM37.pdf","Mexico, Doha, Development, Agenda, WTO, WTO, WTO, Members"

"3720",3720,"53","53.      Deputy Director-General Mr. Ravier said that three categories of issues merited attention. The first category was the procedural issues, and it was up to delegations to decide whether they wished to simply take note of the Plan or to do something more formal. He personally thought that the idea of the document, which could be improved, was that it be taken note of. The second category of issues meriting attention was the link between the Plan and the Doha Ministerial Declaration. Many delegations had mentioned that it was necessary to clarify the link between the capacity building efforts mentioned in the Plan and the Doha Development Agenda. That proposal merited consideration and it would be possible to make that link without any major change to the Plan in its current form. The Plan would have to be structured somewhat differently in order to show what related directly to the Doha Development Agenda and what came from the regular WTO work on technical assistance. Even if the Doha Ministerial Declaration was the politically most visible WT/COMTD/M/37 Page 18 document, WTO technical assistance activities also covered sectors which were not mentioned in the Declaration. The third category related to specific comments on different aspects of the Plan and he would give the floor to the Director of the Technical Cooperation Division to respond to those.","WTCOMTDM37.pdf","Director-General, Ravier, Doha, Development, Agenda, Doha, Development, Agenda, WTO, WTO, Director, Technical, Cooperation, Division"
"3721",3721,"54","54.      Mr. Osakwe said that he had found all comments encouraging as they showed that the Membership supported what the Secretariat did in attempting to reconcile many divergent elements. He expressed particular appreciation to the delegations of Uruguay, Switzerland and others who had mentioned that they had appreciated the private consultations held by the Secretariat with respect to the Plan. At those consultations the Secretariat had attempted to explain to each group how their priorities had been taken into account and where they had differences of view with other stakeholders with particular interests. He was pleased to hear that several delegations had appreciated such consultations and encouraged the Secretariat to continue with them. The Plan contained operational activities. However, the discussion had focussed both on a technical cooperation strategy and on the operational activities in the Plan. It was a good occasion to comment on the broader Strategy which had to be revisited in light of the Doha Ministerial Declaration. Nevertheless, it had to be clear that, in spite of the interlinkages, there was a distinction between the Strategy and the Plan, which contained the operational activities based on mandates and decisions already taken by Members. Four types of comments had been made. First, Members had made general comments and given advice. Those would be taken into account. Second, Members had made comments regarding the presentational format of the Plan. Some of those comments had been contradictory and the Secretariat would have to seek more guidance from Members regarding the format. Nevertheless, he was confident that it could be improved. A third category was comments made at the macro-level such as those regarding coordination, regional groups, and a database. He would mention the intentions of the Secretariat in those respects. Last, there had been a number of comments on the micro level which the Secretariat should take into account.","WTCOMTDM37.pdf","Osakwe, Secretariat, Uruguay, Switzerland, Secretariat, Secretariat, Secretariat, Members, Members, Members, Secretariat, Members, Secretariat, Secretariat"
"3722",3722,"55","55.      He said he wished to begin with the first category relating to general comments and advice. Members would recall that the CTD had established a consensus in 1996 that WTO technical assistance would be demand-driven. That had been stated in the guidelines which had gone to the Ministerial Conference in Singapore and which had been forwarded from the CTD by the then Chairperson Ambassador Benjelloun-Touimi. It was currently realized that the Secretariat could do better. The demand-driven approach had led to a long list of needs often exceeding the capacity of the Secretariat to deliver. It was therefore evident that that consensus had to be modified. The number of ad-hoc demands were growing, but they had to be reduced. Even though it was stated in the Plan, and some Members seemed to agree, that ad-hoc requests should be limited, there had still been many other Members reserving their right to come back with ad-hoc requests. That was an unsustainable situation. The Secretariat had aimed to strike the right balance, but it was for the Members to re-establish the indispensable new consensus to reconcile the growing number of individual country requests with the thematic and mandate-based orientation of technical cooperation that Members had said that they wanted. With respect to the presentational format he said that the current Plan contained a table of contents on the front page and an Annex at the end which gave the number of planned activities per region. It seemed that Members wished the Secretariat to include a new category which would present the technical cooperation mandates from the Doha Ministerial Declaration. It was possible to present the information in that way and the Secretariat would do so in the form of an Annex in a subsequent revision of the document. There were eleven paragraphs in the Doha Ministerial Declaration which contained operative technical cooperation mandates. Those paragraphs would be described and the 428 activities would then be classified accordingly. One delegation had expressed concern that the activities in the Plan seemed to be a simple listing. However, the Plan was based on the Strategy and activities had to be categorized somehow: they could be listed by region, areas of agreed negotiations, areas of work programmes or areas of mandates.                                                                                    WT/COMTD/M/37                                                                                           Page 19","WTCOMTDM37.pdf","Members, CTD, WTO, Singapore, CTD, Chairperson, Ambassador, Benjelloun-Touimi, Secretariat, Secretariat, Members, Members, Secretariat, Members, Members, Members, Secretariat, Secretariat"
"3723",3723,"56","56.      He further said that several delegations had asked for clarification on the issue of coordination. All parties involved in technical cooperation had to improve coordination. The Plan was not a Technical Cooperation Division document.                       The Director-General and Deputy Director-General had ensured that the Plan was composed of activities jointly designed with all operational divisions within the Secretariat. Cooperation within the WTO Secretariat had been ensured through the Technical Cooperation Management Committee (TAMC). Coordination with other agencies was approached at two levels. One level was through the Integrated Framework which focussed specifically on the LDCs. There had been voices for the Integrated Framework concept to be extended to non-LDCs. That did not mean extending the Integrated Framework proper to other countries, but to apply the same coordinated approach to other developing countries that so wished. The WTO Secretariat was decided on that course of action, but WTO Members would have to press for the same change in the other agencies involved. This could encourage the agencies to establish another form of coordination mechanism. The WTO Secretariat aimed to improve coordination with donors, as one part of the coordination problem lay with the donors. There had been the first ever joint meeting of the six core agencies of the Integrated Framework and the OECD Development Assistance Committee in Paris the previous week. Coordination had been paramount. The point had then been made that trade and development ministers had to work more closely together and had to send out clear, consistent and coherent messages. At another level, coordination also had to be improved with the beneficiaries. The WTO Secretariat did not only receive requests for technical cooperation from the permanent missions in Geneva, a flurry of requests was also received from capitals. He had urged developing country missions, in bilateral discussions, to coordinate at their level as well so that the WTO Secretariat did not receive contradictory lists of requests from the same developing country Member. A specific question related to how the WTO Secretariat coordinated with UNCTAD with regard to the mandate of the trade and investment work programme. Mr. Richard Eglin, Director of the WTO Trade and Finance Division, had been in touch with the UNCTAD Secretariat. The WTO Secretariat would hardly organize any regional seminar on trade and investment under the Doha Mandate on investment. Rather, it would work within the framework of the regional seminars to be organized by UNCTAD. Annex I showed that the WTO Secretariat would convene a meeting of agencies on each of the Singapore issues to decide how to coordinate. Another example was that the WTO Secretariat would organize a meeting on trade and competition with the other agencies to discuss coordination already the coming Friday.","WTCOMTDM37.pdf","Director-General, Director-General, Secretariat, WTO, Secretariat, Technical, Cooperation, Management, Committee, Integrated, Framework, WTO, Secretariat, WTO, Members, WTO, Secretariat, Integrated, Framework, OECD, Development, Assistance, Committee, Paris, WTO, Secretariat, Geneva, WTO, Secretariat, Member, WTO, Secretariat, UNCTAD, Richard, Eglin, Director, WTO, Trade, and, Finance, Division, Secretariat, WTO, Secretariat, UNCTAD, WTO, Secretariat, Singapore, WTO, Secretariat"
"3724",3724,"57","57.     He went on to say that evaluation and monitoring was an area of priority where the WTO Secretariat had to improve although some improvements had already been made. The Technical Cooperation Division had originally been monitoring itself. A separate audit within the Secretariat had subsequently been established under Mr. Paul Rolian who worked together with a consultant. The Technical Cooperation Division believed that an external audit should, periodically, be used. Currently, there were two forms for evaluation for every technical cooperation activity. One form was given to the beneficiary host country authority which it had to send back directly to the WTO Secretariat (to the technical cooperation audit) without the person delivering the technical cooperation seeing it. Mr. Rolian's reports then went to senior management as well as to the Technical Cooperation Management Committee. A report on monitoring and evaluation would also go to the CTD in order for Members to better appreciate the evolution of the quality of the technical cooperation delivered.","WTCOMTDM37.pdf","WTO, Secretariat, Technical, Cooperation, Division, Secretariat, Paul, Rolian, WTO, Secretariat, Rolian, Technical, Cooperation, Management, Committee, CTD, Members"
"3725",3725,"58","58.      With respect to costing he said that the formula applied by the WTO Secretariat (Administration and General Services Division) was the standard cost formula which required criteria such as the venue, the number of participants, a comparison of grey-market tickets with regular costs of passengers. This formula could not be applied too far in advance as all the parameters would then not be fixed. That was one of the reasons why the WTO Secretariat could not give a fixed costing of each activity to be carried out in the year 2002 already in January. Nevertheless, every activity would be individually costed. There had also been a question as to whether there had been any contributions to the Doha Development Agenda Global Trust Fund. The Trust Fund had been established and the WT/COMTD/M/37 Page 20 delegation of the United States had pledged a contribution of USD 1 million the previous day. He believed that contributions would grow, based on indications he had received at the meeting with the OECD-DAC. He said that there seemed to be unanimity with respect to the establishment of a database on trade-related technical assistance which would show the assistance delivered, not only by the WTO Secretariat, but by major providers of trade-related technical assistance. The Technical Cooperation Division had established the position of a Web-site manager but needed more assistance. The delegation of the United States had indicated that they would assist the WTO Secretariat in that regard. The delegation of the United States to the OECD-DAC had, at the Paris meeting, presented a recently established database by USAID and USTR on trade-related technical assistance provided by the United States. That database could provide an operating model for a larger database. The WTO Secretariat had therefore asked the United States delegation if it could send its consultant to the WTO Technical Cooperation Management Committee and if the WTO Secretariat could then build on that model. It was important to quickly put up that database as it would provide valuable information for beneficiary countries on what was available as well as what was being done. The database would also help show what technical assistance could be provided in the short term (the coming year) and what could be done later, as well as provide a picture of what the WTO Secretariat was doing and what was done by other agencies and bilateral donors.","WTCOMTDM37.pdf","WTO, Secretariat, -LRB-, Administration, General, Services, Division, WTO, Secretariat, Doha, Development, Agenda, Global, Trust, Fund, Trust, Fund, United, States, WTO, Secretariat, Technical, Cooperation, Division, United, States, WTO, Secretariat, United, States, Paris, USAID, USTR, United, States, WTO, Secretariat, United, States, WTO, Technical, Cooperation, Management, Committee, WTO, Secretariat, WTO, Secretariat"
"3726",3726,"59","59.      He continued by addressing the micro issues. There was an omission in the Plan of an NGO symposium. On page 15 there was an activity related to a symposium involving NGOs on trade and environment. However, there would be another NGO symposium on a broader topic which would be included in the revision of the Plan. A couple of questions had been raised with respect to the ""Geneva Week"" activity. Two ""Geneva Weeks"" were planned for April and October 2002 and they could be found on page 14. The Secretariat was guided by the wish of Members that meetings of the Sub-Committee and the Committee of Trade and Development should be scheduled during those weeks in order to allow representatives from headquarters to participate. Several questions with respect to the JITAP had been raised. The JITAP was designed to terminate in June 2002. The terminal evaluation would begin in February 2002. Approximately 30 applications had been received from individual African countries to have the benefits of the JITAP extended to them. The major providers of the JITAP funds had insisted that the JITAP be reconciled with the Integrated Framework in order not to have too many trust-funds operating indiscriminately and to build synergies. It was therefore necessary to wait for the terminal evaluation before any decision on an extension could be taken. The review of the Integrated Framework, initially scheduled for February 2002, would be held in the form of a seminar in April, after the meeting of trade and development ministers. He said he wished to draw these facts to the attention of delegations as he, at this stage, could not give any more precise answers to the questions. A concrete proposal should be before the CTD before the end of June 2002. Several delegations had mentioned that they wished the WTO Secretariat to distribute the venues for its regional seminars to more countries. It was a question that the Secretariat was looking into. Decisions on the venue was made jointly by the WTO and the regional economic commissions, the regional development banks or the headquarters of the regional institution that the WTO Secretariat was dealing with. There were frequently political and social factors which had to be taken into account in choosing the location. The language with respect to ""agreed negotiations"" in Annex 1 would be clarified as requested by the representative of India. Regarding mainstreaming he said that the language of paragraph 38 of the Doha Ministerial Declaration was clear. However, Members had differing views on how it should be done, through the multilateral intervention of the agencies or through the multilateral agencies providing assistance to countries. There could be a compromise in unanimity in the CTD in that WTO technical assistance should be delivered within a coherent policy framework, not as a conditionality. That policy framework could either be the country Plan or their sovereign determined Poverty Reduction Strategy Papers. For every region there would be a regional seminar on mainstreaming. There had been a question on the distinction between seminars, conferences and capacity building. The WTO Secretariat was using the literal English language usage. The Secretariat would produce a revision which would seek to accommodate the views and priorities expressed by Members.

"3728",3728,"60","60.      Deputy Director-General Mr. Ouedraogo said that in his capacity as Deputy Director-General in charge of the CTD he wished to make one comment and the observations. The Plan represented a large effort to rationalize the WTO technical cooperation activities and contribute rigour and discipline to their implementation. That should assure the donors and give a new boost to technical assistance. He said that the first observation he wished to make related to the fact that he had recently returned from New York where he had participated in the proceedings of the Preparatory Committee for the International Conference on Financing for Development. At the opening of those proceedings, the Secretary-General of the United Nations had said that ""what was essential in every programming exercise was to make decisions that could be implemented"". WTO technical cooperation was important for developing countries, and it was therefore important that the financing of it was assured. Donors present in the CTD had proposed changes to the Plan and he hoped that, with those changes incorporated, financing would be forthcoming. The second observation related to the development dimension of the WTO. It was clear that the WTO contributed to development. That was, in fact, the reason why the outcome of the Doha Ministerial Meeting was called the Doha Development Agenda. That was also one of the reasons why the Secretary-General of the Untied Nations had called on the WTO to be one of the major institutional stakeholders of the International Conference on Financing for Development to be held in Monterrey, Mexico in March. The WTO did not finance development in the sense that it did not finance such things as infrastructure in developing countries. It was through its technical assistance programme that the WTO contributed.","WTCOMTDM37.pdf","Director-General, Ouedraogo, Director-General, CTD, WTO, New, York, Preparatory, Committee, United, Nations, WTO, CTD, WTO, WTO, Doha, Development, Agenda, WTO, Monterrey, Mexico, WTO, WTO"
"3729",3729,"61","61.      His third comment related to the JITAP. The JITAP would be evaluated. There had been 27 demands from LDCs and other African countries to benefit from the JITAP programme as it had led to concrete results. He said that he hoped that donors would keep that in mind. There was a complementarity between the JITAP and the Integrated Framework. He said that one example was a sub-regional workshop that he himself had attended in west Africa. The participating countries of that workshop had positive impressions of JITAP. There was no contradiction. Both the JITAP and the Integrated Framework aimed at building capacity in developing countries. Developing countries represented over 80 per cent of the WTO Membership and capacity building was one means of assisting those countries to participate more actively in world trade.","WTCOMTDM37.pdf","Integrated, Framework, Africa, JITAP, Integrated, Framework, WTO"
"3730",3730,"62","62.      The representative of the United States said that her delegation had understood that the Committee would ""take note"" of the Plan. Her delegation supported the overall initiative of the Plan and was actively engaged on a number of levels, including through a contribution to the new Global Trust Fund as had been announced by her the Minister of Trade. She would have made a number of statements with respect to possible improvements to the Plan that her delegation wished other delegations to be aware of. However, as the Plan would be revised, her delegation would shortly circulate a non-paper containing suggestions for improvements. One such change would be the reference in Section VI concerning tools for development. Her government was a supporter of the increased use of information technology, especially in technical assistance. However, her delegation had concerns regarding the information technology element and wished to review it further. She said that she hoped that the Secretariat would take her delegations comments into account in the revised draft Plan. There was a need to gear particular programmes towards a particular result. Her delegation had noted the comments made by a number of delegations including St Lucia and Zambia regarding the necessity to balance the attention given to different regions in particular need of technical assistance.","WTCOMTDM37.pdf","United, States, Committee, Secretariat, St, Lucia, Zambia"
"3731",3731,"63","63.     The representative of Zambia said that his delegation would also be submitting a paper containing specific comments on the Plan and he said that he hoped that the Secretariat would take those into account in the revised Plan. The Doha Ministerial Declaration had made specific reference to the LDCs. He wondered why some non-LDCs would receive as many as eight missions compared to only one mission to many LDCs when the WTO Technical Cooperation Strategy stated that although technical cooperation was for all developing countries, Members had asked that LDCs be given priority. There was thus no consistency between the Strategy and the Plan. In addition, the WT/COMTD/M/37 Page 22 Integrated Framework Pilot Scheme focussed on three countries. He asked what would happen to the LDCs which were not included in the Pilot Scheme as it was stated in the Plan that the Pilot countries would be used as a basis. On the macro-level it was important that there was a specific section or unit in the WTO Secretariat which dealt with LDCs. A unit had been established after the Seattle Ministerial Conference but it had recently disappeared. There should be a particular focus on LDCs both in the Plan and in the WTO Secretariat.","WTCOMTDM37.pdf","Zambia, Secretariat, LDCs, WTO, Technical, Cooperation, Strategy, Members, WTO, Secretariat, Seattle, Ministerial, Conference, WTO, Secretariat"
"3732",3732,"64","64.      The representative of the European Communities said that his delegation was satisfied with the explanations given regarding the next steps. However, the revision had to be made before the holding of the Pledging Conference, as the basis for that Conference would be the Plan. He indicated that there would be some additional funding forthcoming. Regarding the suggestion to use the model of one donor country in the presentation of technical assistance, a clear definition of activities had to be found in order for different things not to be mixed. Only one model had been quoted but other models were available. The OECD for example was working on one. The forthcoming meeting of the Committee in February should contain a discussion on what happened to the WTO Technical Assistance Strategy and the concepts of demand-drivenness and ownership. A certain demand was defined through the Doha Ministerial Declaration which could help reconcile the idea of a strategy and operational activities. They were not completely separate and there was already a link. His delegation had noted the point that the delegation of India had a different view of what had been done in paragraph 20 of the Doha Ministerial Declaration regarding agreed negotiations in the Annex on Investment and Singapore issues. However, his delegation did not want the issue to go the other way in the sense that other delegations would ask for the insertion of the language ""to be"" agreed negotiations. The best way out was to leave that discussion to the General Council and the Trade Negotiations Committee and only to refer to the paragraphs where there was full agreement that technical assistance should take place, such as paragraph 21 with respect to investment. There was no need for that issue to hold up the work on technical assistance in the CTD.","WTCOMTDM37.pdf","European, Communities, OECD, Committee, WTO, Technical, Assistance, Strategy, India, Singapore, General, Council, Trade, Negotiations, Committee, CTD"

"3734",3734,"66","66.     The representative of Djibouti said that, as mentioned by Deputy Director-General Mr. Ouedraogo, it was impossible to implement any technical assistance project without adequate financing. It was therefore key to the integration of developing countries into the multilateral trading system that the technical cooperation activities of the WTO Secretariat were fully funded. There was no use in planning activities which could not be financed. His delegation was of the view that it was important that an LDC unit be established within the Secretariat. He asked why the WTO did not use the example of WIPO and UNCTAD, which had centralized all issues relating to the LDCs in one place.","WTCOMTDM37.pdf","Djibouti, Director-General, Ouedraogo, WTO, Secretariat, Secretariat, WTO, WIPO, UNCTAD, LDCs"

"3736",3736,"68","68.      The Chairman said that technical assistance to some extent was demand-driven.

He recalled that, pending the outcome of the General Council process, such observer status would be on an ad hoc basis.

"3739",3739,"70","70.      Deputy Director-General Mr. Ravier said that the relevant document had been issued under document symbol WT/COMTD/W/89/Rev.1. Members would recall that they had already been informed at the meeting of the Committee in October last year of the activities the Training Institute envisaged for the year 2002. The work programme of the Training Institute had been revised in order to take the decisions taken at the Doha Ministerial Conference and in Geneva, with the adoption of the 2002 budget, into account. Document WT/COMTD/W/89/Rev.1 complemented and specified the information provided to delegations last year. The activities of the Training Institute complemented those contained in the Technical Assistance Plan. That was also the reason why the documents were examined in parallel. He said that he was of the view that future discussions on WTO technical assistance should always be linked to a discussion on training as the two were inter-related. Members had, in the course of the discussion of the WTO budget, approved a doubling of the activities of the Training Institute. The doubling concerned essentially the three-month Trade Policy Courses. That increase would substantially increase the courses available to Members and especially to developing country Members. Even if it had not been foreseen that the doubling of the three-month courses would be fully operational before 2003 (for practical reasons), the training activities would increase during 2002 with visible results already during the second semester of 2002. Members had also decided, in the course of the December 2001 budget discussion, to regularly finance training activities which previously depended exclusively on extra-budgetary resources. That was particularly the case for the Short Trade-Policy Courses for LDCs which, during the last few years, had become a more or less regular training feature. Two of the new mandates given to the Training Institute at its creation in June 2001 were to be concretised during the first part of 2002, i.e. training of trainers and distance learning. First, training of trainers would be undertaken to increase the quality of the training given by Secretariat experts when they were asked to participate in training or technical cooperation activities. The second phase of the programme, which would start in the second half of the year 2002, was intended for developing country trainers. The first part would be financed through already existing voluntary extra-budgetary resources. The financing of the second part had still not been ensured but was currently being costed. He hoped that this responded to one of the questions raised in the earlier discussion on technical cooperation. The Training Institute was also supervising the preparatory work for the launching of a pilot project on distance learning through a training course on line for about 65 participants in developing countries. The pilot project, which was scheduled for mid 2002, would permit modifications to be made before the launching of a more ambitious distance-learning programme on which the Training Institute was currently working. A third sphere of activities concerned the relations with universities, in particular those in developing countries. That activity had recently not received much attention as it had not yet received the necessary financing to give it the desired content. However, he hoped that that situation would improve.","WTCOMTDM37.pdf","Director-General, Ravier, Members, Committee, Training, Institute, Training, Institute, Doha, Ministerial, Conference, Geneva, Training, Institute, WTO, Members, WTO, Training, Institute, Members, Members, Members, Training, Institute, Secretariat, Training, Institute, Training, Institute"
"3740",3740,"71","71.      He went on to say that coherence and complementarity between the activities of the Training Institute and the technical cooperation programmes were one of the priorities of the Secretariat. The role of the Technical Assistance Management Committee, which he chaired, was to ensure the implementation of that priority. He also mentioned the future role of the Joint Consultative Board on WTO-related Training which encompassed representatives of UNCTAD, ITC, World Bank, universities and WTO Members through the Chairpersons of the WTO Committees directly concerned by development matters. One of the objectives of that Board was to ameliorate the cooperation between the organizations in the area of training. The Board had held its first meeting in November 2001. The Training Institute was already cooperating closely with a number of agencies which were active in the area of training.","WTCOMTDM37.pdf","Training, Institute, Secretariat, Technical, Assistance, Management, Committee, Joint, Consultative, Board, UNCTAD, ITC, World, Bank, WTO, Members, WTO, Committees, Board, Training, Institute"

The representative of India said that he was pleased to note that the activities of the Training Institute were being diversified with the introduction of a pilot project to offer distance-learning on line. In fact, in one of his delegation's earlier interactions with the Training Institute, such a course had been suggested. His delegation was therefore grateful to the WTO Secretariat for the introduction WT/COMTD/M/37 Page 24 of that new activity. He hoped that this would assist interested people in developing countries to benefit from an increased understanding of the WTO Agreements without having to come to Geneva. On the last page of the document, there seemed to be a mistake as the twenty-first and twenty-second Trade Policy Courses had both been given the same dates.","WTCOMTDM37.pdf","India, Training, Institute, Training, Institute, WTO, Secretariat, WTO, Geneva"

The representative of the European Communities said that it was his delegation's belief that the training activities were important to spread the knowledge of the WTO into wider circles. His delegation wished to make two points in that respect. First, the planned on-line activities were important and his delegation encouraged the Training Institute to consider what other Geneva-based agencies had done in that respect. He knew that WIPO and other agencies had done some good work which the WTO might learn from. The second was that his delegation encouraged the Training Institute to seek as much cooperation as possible with institutions which did already train people. From the experience of the European Communities he knew that there were numerous such institutions within the Communities which would be ready to cooperate. There were also more and more possible counterparts in developing countries which would be effective partners in delivering joint training activities.","WTCOMTDM37.pdf","European, Communities, WTO, Training, Institute, WIPO, WTO, Training, Institute"

Budget estimates were given jointly with funding in the document, which he assumed referred to the actual resources available, in relation to the budget. He asked whether the figures stated the real anticipated costs and available funds, and whether the current resources would meet the expected costs.","WTCOMTDM37.pdf","Zambia"
"3747",3747,"78","78.      The Director of the Training Institute said that he would begin by the last question. The Training Institute currently had enough resources to carry out its activities with the exception, which was mentioned in the table of the document, of the second phase of the training-of-trainers programme. Otherwise, the financial resources seemed to be sufficient to cover the activities mentioned in the document. However, in order to increase the activities of the Training Institute in the future, increased resources would have to be made available. The mandate received in June 2001 had begun to be implemented. Most of the second part of last year had been devoted to preparation for the activities which were new to the Training Institute as well and to prepare the ground for pilot projects and other activities which could be implemented. There was therefore always a need for additional funding, but for projects yet to be defined. There was another activity which lacked funding relating to contacts with academia in developing countries. The Training Institute would, in the weeks to come, work on defining certain projects and contact donors. With respect to courses in French he said that he wished to draw the delegations' attention to footnote 11 on page 8. The Training Institute found itself in a difficult situation as it could not begin to double the courses straight away. First, there was a need for an additional training room for a new set of students. He hoped that                                                                                      WT/COMTD/M/37                                                                                             Page 25 this room would be ready by the end of August 2002 and it would then be possible to give two courses in parallel which would begin the cycle of double courses. The doubling would only be finalized in 2003 when the first 6 courses would have been held and it was in the beginning of 2003 that the course in French would be held. For every cycle, there would be four courses in English, one each in French and Spanish, which corresponded quite closely to the demand for fellowships in each language. The dates were not wrong, as the plan was to hold two parallel courses. The aim was to carry out joint activities of the two groups as often as possible since the new room would allow for that. In the initial phase of preparations for the pilot schemes, the Training Institute had contacted all possible other agencies with experience in the field and had benefitted from extensive advice and collaboration. The same had applied to the phase of bidding for the providers of such services where the Training Institute had benefitted from several demonstrations of different programmes which had enabled them to better select the service provider.","WTCOMTDM37.pdf","Director, Training, Institute, Training, Institute, Training, Institute, Training, Institute, Training, Institute, Training, Institute, Training, Institute, Training, Institute"
"3748",3748,"79","79.      He further said that concerning the selection process for the courses, all the beneficiary countries were aware of the criteria as they were published each time an invitation was sent. Those criteria were public and concerned age, education, language skills in the language of the course, work experience in the area of trade policy and, a criterion on which the Training Institute insisted strongly, whether the candidates would, upon completion of the course, return to their respective Ministries and actually work with WTO-related issues. The selection was carried out at two levels; at the level of the Training Institute and at the Senior Management level of the WTO Secretariat. There were also a number of other criteria. For example, the aim was to have some regional distribution in order for the participants in each group to benefit from each others' experiences. Female representation was another consideration. There were no specific percentages but when there were many applicants, women were well represented. Since 1997 there was a mandate to give LDCs special attention. That priority was always taken into account, although it was difficult to achieve in the Spanish-speaking courses as there were not many Spanish-speaking LDC applicants. However, there was a tendency for a greater and greater regional representation in all courses. Countries which previously only made requests to attend French-speaking courses had made requests for courses held in English and Spanish, and vice-versa, so there seemed to be a certain mobility.","WTCOMTDM37.pdf","Training, Institute, Training, Institute, WTO, Secretariat"

"3750",3750,"80","80.      He contributed by saying that there was a system of evaluation that had been described in the document WT/COMTD/W/86/Add.1 which had been provided to the CTD in the year 2001. A system for evaluation existed since many years, but it had been updated for the longer Trade Policy Courses. The evaluation method had lately been adapted to other activities of the Institute. For each activity there was thus a quite elaborated evaluation mechanism regarding aspects such as the degree of knowledge transferred, as experienced by the participants, and the efficiency of the experts making the presentations. All aspects were included in the evaluation. The Training Institute was also in the process of studying how the evaluation method could be adapted to suit some of the new activities as they would be different, such as the distance learning courses or the training of trainers. Another area of monitoring that the Training Institute would be interested in, but which it could not undertake for reasons of sovereignty of WTO Members over their internal affairs, was to look at what happened to the students trained once they returned to their countries. However, there were indirect methods to verify what had happened. For example, a fact that was readily verifiable was that an increasing number of Geneva-based delegates from developing countries were former participants of the Trade Policy Course. More than eighty former Trade Policy Course participants were currently in Geneva and among those a number of ambassadors. Through contacts with capitals it was also known that a number of former Trade Policy Course participants worked as trade-policy experts in capitals. That was an indirect way of measuring the impact of the courses. However, he hoped for future methods of analysis and evaluation in capitals with the help of the governments, which would permit to measure the exact impact of the courses.","WTCOMTDM37.pdf","CTD, Institute, Training, Institute, Training, Institute, WTO, Members, Geneva, Trade, Policy, Course"

The Trade Negotiating Committee had agreed, on 1 February 2002, that the work on special and differential treatment stemming from the Doha Ministerial Meeting should be carried out in Special Sessions of the Committee on Trade and Development (CTD). The issue of special and differential treatment had therefore been taken off the agenda of the regular session of the CTD. An invitation to a Special Session following the Regular Session of the Committee had been sent out after that decision on the assumption that a Chairman for the Special Session would have been selected in the General Council. In the absence of a General Council decision on chairs the Chairman had consulted informally. The Special Session would therefore be postponed until a chairperson had been elected. An invitation to a Special Session of the CTD would be issued as soon as practicable.","WTCOMTDM38.pdf","Chairman, Trade, Negotiating, Committee, Committee, on, Trade, and, Development, CTD, Committee, Chairman, General, Council, General, Council, Chairman, CTD"

It was to be noted, that planned activities in            several cases had to be postponed, some at the request of the beneficiary country            concerned and others, in order to be able to respond to emergency ad hoc missions            related to notifications to be executed within a mandatory time-frame. Officials in            the Technical Cooperation Division were in contact with delegations in the regions of            their responsibility in order to identify definite dates and venues for execution of the            planned activities. The rate of implementation was and equally dependent on the            beneficiary countries as the Secretariat and providers of assistance.      (c)   Third, the Revision of the Plan contained in document WT/COMTD/W/95/Rev.1. had            been issued to respond to Members' comments and observations during the last            meeting. The Secretariat would issue revisions to the Plan when even necessary.            These were transitional years for WTO Technical Cooperation and the Secretariat            continued to explore optimal strategies for how to best respond to the new and            unprecedented development agenda established at Doha Ministerial Conference. The            Secretariat's approach was stated in paragraph 2 of the Plan and the Secretariat would            continue to be guided by superior advice, which commanded consensus.      (d)   Fourth, Members would certainly agree with the dynamic and evolving nature of the            Plan. He insisted that both the Plan and its implementation were work in progress.            That would ensure that it met the needs of both providers of resources and of            beneficiaries. Since the last meeting, the Secretariat had consulted with several            regional and subregional groupings, such as CARICOM in order to fine tune and            focus the Plan more precisely around the needs of the beneficiaries. The Secretariat            expressed its appreciation to the CARICOM Group for their positive and constructive            suggestions on the fine tuning of the Plan to better respond to the needs of the Latin            American and Caribbean region.      (e)   Fifth, consultations had been held or were in progress with multilateral agencies to            identify the complementary contributions that they could make. On 25 January 2002            the Secretariat had held interagency consultations with the World Bank, OECD and            UNCTAD. The purpose of those had been to develop enhanced interagency            co-operation on technical cooperation and capacity-building in the field of            competition policy, to explain the Doha mandate to other agencies in that regard, and            to seek their support and cooperation in its fulfilment. The Secretariat had exchanged            experiences on the best way of meeting the needs of developing countries.            Discussions on each organization's specific technical cooperation plans had led to the            identification of specific opportunities for cooperation and coordination among the            organizations. The inter-agency meeting was considered successful by the            participating agencies. The invited agencies had underlined their support for            enhanced cooperation to meet the requirements of the Doha Ministerial Declaration.            The Secretariat had been able to identify complementarities between the types of            technical assistance provided by the different organizations, and advantage would be            taken of that complementarity. A significant number of specific possibilities for            cooperation in the form of joint activities, mutual support for each others activities,            and coordinated activities had been identified, especially with UNCTAD. It had also            been agreed that interagency cooperation had to be viewed as an ongoing process and            that representatives of the various organizations would remain in contact with each            other on a regular basis to exchange information on coming events. The Secretariat            was in the process of following-up with each of the organizations to work out the            practical details. Further information on capacity-building for trade and competition            policy in accordance with the objectives set out in Annex 1 of the Plan would be                                                                                   WT/COMTD/M/38                                                                                           Page 5                 provided at the informal meeting of the Working Group on the Interaction Between                 Trade and Competition Policy on 26 February 2002. The second example was of the                 Working Group on Trade and Investment which had already held an informal                 meeting to examine the issue of technical assistance and capacity-building in its                 specific area with the substantive participation of the UNCTAD Secretariat. More                 information would be provided as soon as possible on consultations with UNCTAD                 in that regard. The third example was that the Secretariat had convened a meeting                 with several agencies and the key providers of technical assistance on                 19 February 2002 to define the structure, parameters and categories for the WTO                 Technical Assistance Database that would be used to provide information to                 Members on trade-related technical assistance activities by beneficiary countries and                 by donor countries in accordance with the Doha Ministerial mandate. More                 information would be provided by the Secretariat at a subsequent meeting of the                 CTD. Finally, the Director-General had convened a meeting of Integrated                 Framework Heads of Agencies in Washington on 26 February 2002, which would be                 hosted by Mr. Wolfensohn, the President of the World Bank. The WTO Director-                 General would host a joint meeting of the WTO African Group and the Least-                 Developed Countries Consultative Group on 19 February 2002 to seek their advice in                 advance of the IF heads of Agencies meeting. The Heads of Agency meeting would                 focus inter alia on the implementation of the IF pilot scheme and its extension to                 other countries. A report would be made to the Sub-Committee on Least-Developed                 Countries after that meeting.         (f)     The Pledging Conference for the Doha Developmental Agenda Trust Fund had been                 scheduled for 11 March 2002. He hoped to have Ministerial participation at that                 event and mentioned that invitations had been circulated to all Members. He said that                 the Secretariat appealed to donors and invited agencies to ensure that the Pledging                 Conference would be a success. Success would maintain the post-Doha momentum                 on the central issue of Technical Cooperation and Capacity-Building.         (g)     He emphasized that the Annual Plan could not respond to all the needs of the                 beneficiary countries. The Plan was only one out of five basic elements in the overall                 architecture for responding to the Doha Mandate on Technical Cooperation and                 Capacity-Building.","WTCOMTDM38.pdf","CTD, Secretariat, Members, Secretariat, Members, Technical, Cooperation, Division, Secretariat, Members, Secretariat, WTO, Technical, Cooperation, Secretariat, Doha, Ministerial, Conference, Secretariat, Secretariat, Members, Secretariat, CARICOM, Secretariat, CARICOM, Group, Caribbean, Secretariat, World, Bank, OECD, UNCTAD, Doha, Secretariat, Secretariat, UNCTAD, Secretariat, Working, Group, Working, Group, on, Trade, and, Investment, Secretariat, UNCTAD, Secretariat, WTO, Technical, Assistance, Database, Members, Doha, Secretariat, CTD, Director-General, Integrated, Framework, Heads, of, Agencies, Washington, Wolfensohn, World, Bank, WTO, Director, WTO, African, Group, Least, -, Developed, Countries, Consultative, Group, Doha, Developmental, Agenda, Trust, Fund, Members, Secretariat"

He began with the costing of the activities that were covered by the 2002 Plan. Nearly all of the activities were known to the Secretariat when they prepared the estimates that were used to arrive at the CHF 15 million figure WT/COMTD/M/38 Page 6 which had subsequently been agreed by Members as the target for the 2002 Doha Development Agenda Global Trust Fund. The costing that had been arrived at for those activities in 2002 based on the 456 activities in the Plan and came to approximately CHF 14.9 million. The costing was arrived at by taking the following elements into account. First the estimated costs of the activities themselves was about CHF 16.1 million. That amount had then been reduced on account of cost sharing arrangements with other intergovernmental organizations that the WTO Secretariat anticipated arriving at, in particular, with respect to the regional activities. The reduction in the cost because of this to the WTO came to about CHF 2.9 million. In addition, the programme support fund cost of CHF 1.7 million had to be added. The consolidated total cost then came to CHF 14,886,376. In arriving at those figures the Secretariat had applied standard costing methodologies assigning different standard costs for a one day of activity for one person, depending upon whether the activity was classed as a regional activity, a national activity or a miscellaneous activity taking place in Geneva with the last one actually being the most expensive because it usually implied bringing in speakers and participants from outside of Geneva.","WTCOMTDM38.pdf","Director-General, Andrew, Stoler, Members, Members, Doha, Development, Agenda, Global, Trust, Fund, Secretariat, Members, Doha, Development, Agenda, Global, Trust, Fund, WTO, Secretariat, WTO, Secretariat, Geneva, Geneva"

However, since the General Council had agreed on the CHF 15 million level for the Doha Development Agenda Global Trust Fund, a number of additional activities had been identified and costed. Most of those activities were described in Annex 1 to WT/COMTD/W/95/Rev.1. The additional activities and their estimated costs were the following. First, there were future activities of the WTO Training Institute which had not been covered by the regular budget in 2002 and those activities would require around CHF 300,000. Secondly, there was technical assistance relating to trade and investment where there was an additional amount contributed to the project of CHF 1.8 million expected from UNCTAD. The share due to the WTO was based on what was in Annex 1 and was about 2 million Swiss francs in 2002. The third category of additional expenses related to technical assistance with regard to trade and competition policy and amounted to CHF 250,000 for the year 2002. Finally there were CHF 331,500 of programme support funds associated with that extra Annex 1 activity so that the consolidated total that would be reached with the Annex 1 activities would be an additional CHF 2,881,5000. It was estimated that all the projects taken together would involve a cost to the WTO, over and above the regular budget available for technical cooperation, of about CHF 16.3 million. About 19 per cent of that amount would be devoted to national activities, about 76 per cent to regional activities and the remainder to expenses on the tools which were identified in Section 6 of WT/COMTD/W/95/Rev.1. The Secretariat wished to see pledges to the Doha Development Agenda Global Trust Fund in 2002 for about CHF 16.3 million and reminded delegations that the Secretariat would be covering a considerable amount of WTO staff technical-assistance related travel through CHF 1.5 million provided for the regular budget for that purpose.","WTCOMTDM38.pdf","General, Council, Doha, Development, Agenda, Global, Trust, Fund, WTO, Training, Institute, UNCTAD, WTO, WTO, Secretariat, Secretariat, WTO"

"3813",3813,"17","17.      The representative of Venezuela said that the document corresponded to the variety of topics for negotiation mentioned in the Doha Ministerial Declaration for negotiations and future work. However, it concentrated more on traditional items of the commercial agenda and relatively few activities were devoted to the Singapore issues. The document enumerated many organizations that were going to cooperate in the activities, some of which were subregional. She said that complementarity with UNCTAD had not been mentioned in any of the activities being planned for Latin America. It was her understanding that the Technical Assistance Plan presented by UNCTAD’s Secretary-General, Mr. Ricupero, referred to cooperation with other bodies, in particular with the WTO. Delegations wished to see more cooperation between agencies and it would therefore have been timely if the WTO assistance plan had foreseen joint activities with UNCTAD. Her delegation was convinced that the two institutions' somewhat different mandates would not give rise to                                                                                    WT/COMTD/M/38                                                                                            Page 7 duplication of efforts and would benefit Members. On several occasions the WTO technical assistance activities in the Andean countries and in Venezuela had been prepared jointly with UNCTAD and had given rise to excellent results. It was important that that positive experience of cooperation, which her delegation understood to be also true for Africa, be repeated in the Latin American region. There should be more cooperation between UNCTAD and the WTO in the activities foreseen at the regional level in the areas of services, agriculture, environment and the new issues. She sought clarification on the implications of paragraph 2.2 of the document which refered to the efficient coordination of technical assistance with multilateral agencies and the consequences of the word synergy in that context. She asked whether the technical assistance resources being earmarked for joint activities with UNCTAD could be requested by individual delegations also. With regard the list of activities she said that it was necessary to consult with the Members before defining the programmes and the topics, as stated in paragraph 3(iii) of the Secretariat’s document. It was also important that countries participated in the organization of the activities so as to better reflect the interests and the needs of each country.","WTCOMTDM38.pdf","Venezuela, Singapore, UNCTAD, Latin, America, UNCTAD, Ricupero, WTO, WTO, UNCTAD, Page, 7, Members, WTO, Venezuela, UNCTAD, Africa, UNCTAD, WTO, UNCTAD, Members, Secretariat"
"3814",3814,"18","18.     The representative of Japan said that his delegation wished to continue to consult with the Secretariat in order to make the Plan a better one. It was good that the Secretariat had already entered into consultation with other agencies in order to coordinate the efforts and share costs. His Government was studying ways to contribute to the Global Trust Fund, which he felt should also cover the technical assistance and capacity building activities on the so-called Singapore issues, especially on trade and investment. He believed that the document had been improved. It clearly showed a linkage between technical assistance activities and the Doha Development Agenda. However, there was room for the further improvement.","WTCOMTDM38.pdf","Japan, Secretariat, Secretariat, Global, Trust, Fund, Singapore, Doha, Development, Agenda"
"3815",3815,"19","19.      The representative of Cuba said that she was fully aware of the importance that Ministers at the Doha Ministerial Conference had attributed to technical assistance and capacity-building. It was referred to in over ten paragraphs in the Ministerial Declaration and it emphasised that technical assistance and capacity-building should be guaranteed and predictable. Her delegation urged the donors to make the necessary contributions so that a comprehensive plan could be carried out that satisfied the needs of all Members. Her delegation was satisfied with the coordination between the WTO and other specialized agencies, in particular with UNCTAD. That would avoid duplication of efforts and would be able to better tap available resources in other organizations. She approved of coordinated activities, particularly in dealing with the Singapore topics, as well as regarding the database. The database was of fundamental importance for developing countries so that they could better understand and hence be able to participate more fully in negotiations on market access. There was a need for greater coordination of efforts with UNCTAD with a view to derive more benefits from the resources available in that organization. Although technical assistance was not the solution to the problems which developing countries faced, it would clearly assist them in providing a better understanding of the different topics, many of which were relatively new.","WTCOMTDM38.pdf","Cuba, Doha, Ministerial, Conference, Members, WTO, UNCTAD, Singapore, UNCTAD"
"3816",3816,"2","2.       He went on to say that after the meeting of the CTD on 22 January 2002 which had been entirely devoted to Technical Cooperation and Training, the WTO Secretariat had prepared a revision of the Technical Cooperation Plan and an Agenda item on Technical Cooperation had therefore been included on the Agenda. The CTD would have normally elected its chairperson at the end of the first meeting of the year. However, the Chairman of the General Council was still in the process of holding consultations on the slate of officers for the different WTO bodies. As the CTD Chair could not be decided independently of the overall election of officers, the CTD would have to elect its chairperson for 2002 at its next regular session, scheduled for 23 April 2002 as the first substantial item on the agenda of that Meeting. He further suggested that the election of chairperson for the Sub- Committee on Least Developed Counties also be deferred to the following Meeting. He therefore proposed that Agenda Item C on the Election of Chairperson of the Committee on Trade and Development and Agenda Item E on the Election of Chairperson of the Sub-Committee on Least Developed Countries be postponed and put on the agenda of the next regular session.","WTCOMTDM38.pdf","CTD, WTO, Secretariat, CTD, Chairman, General, Council, WTO, CTD, Sub, -, Committee, on, Least, Developed, Counties, Chairperson, Committee, on, Trade, and, Development, and, Agenda, Item, E, Chairperson"
"3817",3817,"20","20.      The representative of Zambia said that the Plan was well structured and the activities clear and interesting. His delegation believed that in order for technical assistance and capacity-building to effectively support developing countries' participation in the negotiations it had to meet specific criteria. It should be designed in accordance with developing country needs and agendas. The Zanzibar Declaration provided clear guidelines in that regard. Secondly, his delegation believed that it had to encompass different topics on the trade agenda in a comprehensive manner. The key was that it be linked to Members developmental goals. Thirdly, it should recognize the need for identifying and pursuing common interests in negotiations, particularly through support to the regional and subregional integration agreements, and in particular to LDCs. He went on to say that he was aware that the WTO could deliver just one type of technical assistance, one which was focused on trade rules and the implementation of trade agreements. He believed such technical assistance to be in accordance with the WTO's mandate. At the same time, in light of WTO's limited mandate his delegation could not expect any technical assistance activities to be able to help his Government WT/COMTD/M/38 Page 8 identity its interests in the negotiations. That was something that had been acknowledged even by the Secretariat itself. Other agencies had to be actively involved in providing different perspectives and options so that delegations' positions could be based on an understanding of the various possibilities. One size fits all assistance and standardized products would have limited impact. That was why an intense cooperation with other agencies had to be included in the formulation of any WTO assistance programme. He noted the section devoted to the Integrated Framework and the reference made on page 4 to ""mainstreaming"" and asked for clarification on the practical implications of channelling assistance on trade negotiations through the IF and the precise meaning of the terms ""Mainstreaming"" and ""synergies""'. Those questions related to the role of the IF in trade negotiations. His delegation looked forward to receiving clear indications from the WTO Secretariat on the substantive content of the list of seminars and missions indicated in the Plan. They had to be explained in terms of objectives and modalities. He hoped that in the future, more attention would be paid to a balanced distribution of programmes.","WTCOMTDM38.pdf","Zambia, Members, WTO, WTO, WTO, Secretariat, WTO, WTO, Secretariat"
"3818",3818,"21","21.      The representative of India mentioned that capacity-building extended to beyond holding of seminars and would require a long-term commitment. Capacity among developing countries was not equal. Many developing countries would have to start from zero. The pace of expansion of WTO activities should take the capacity of developing countries into account. In the delivery of technical assistance the Secretariat should explore the possibilities of making use of other institutions, particularly those which specialized in international trade and economic relations. Certain institutions had a good understanding of the situation in developing countries and would be able to better design specific codes for developing countries. In that respect the training of trainers in developing countries was important as such training would have a multiplier effect. He recalled the 16 January 2002 meeting of CTD, where his delegation had made some comments. He felt that those observations had not been taken on board in the revised document prepared by the Secretariat. His delegation had pointed out that in some instances when the Doha Ministerial Declaration had been recalled, phrases had been added by the Secretariat which gave a wrong impression and had the effect of changing the balance in the Ministerial Declaration. His delegation suggested that where specific paragraphs of the Doha Ministerial Declaration had been referred to, the exact language of the paragraph should be used without any revision. He drew attention to paragraphs 4 and 5 of the Document as well as Annex 1, in which it had been suggested that the Singapore issues had a certain hierarchy. His delegation did not see any specific hierarchy mentioned in the Doha Ministerial Declaration which gave either the Singapore issues or environment, a higher priority. Market access issues were equally important, if not more important. Paragraph 11 mentioned that the principle rationale of merging the WTO Development and Economic Research divisions was to adjust the Secretariat to address the development and technical cooperation and capacity-building mandates through research activities to provide factual and analytical information. His delegation found no mention of such studies in the Plan which only focused on national seminars, regional seminars and workshops and training courses. Analytical studies would assist developing countries in better understanding the various aspects involved in the post-Doha negotiations phase. Paragraph 1 of Annex 1 of the raised Plan mentioned that the Secretariat's Annual Plan for technical assistance contained activities focusing in particular on Singapore issues, so as to better prepare Members for negotiations. Technical assistance and capacity-building was intended to create awareness among the developing countries and LDCs about the implications of a multilateral framework of rules in any area and to enable them to take a decision at the Fifth Ministerial Conference when the issues relating to the start of negotiations and modalities would come up for a decision. That was clearly noted in paragraph 21 of the Doha Ministerial Declaration and any technical assistance should clearly state that the objective was to enable developing countries and LDCs to better evaluate the implication of closer multilateral cooperation for their developmental policies and objectives and human and institution development rather than what had been mentioned in the document provided by the Secretariat. He requested that his delegations concerns which had also been mentioned in the previous meeting be taken into account in order for his delegation to agree to the document. The first paragraph of Annex 2 mentioned that in paragraph 31 to 33 of the Doha Ministerial Declaration, Members had agreed to negotiations, even                                                                                      WT/COMTD/M/38                                                                                              Page 9 though this reference existed only in paragraph 31.        He requested the Secretariat to revise the document accordingly.","WTCOMTDM38.pdf","India, WTO, Secretariat, CTD, Secretariat, Secretariat, Singapore, Singapore, WTO, Development, and, Economic, Research, Secretariat, Secretariat, Singapore, Members, LDCs, LDCs, Secretariat, Members, Secretariat"
"3819",3819,"22","22.     Referring back to Annex 1 in the trade and investment part he went on to say that the Secretariat and Deputy Director-General Ravier had mentioned that this was work in progress which would be further elaborated and developed in consultation with other international agencies like UNCTAD. Analytical studies which would help developing countries understand various aspects of trade and investment could be included in that section. An analytical study of trade and investment would assist developing countries to participate effectively in regional seminars and national workshops that related to the topic. He referred to footnote 2 of the table in Annex 5 which showed the number of planned activities by region. His delegation felt that an activity could then be categorised under"" LDC activities"" even if only one LDC was participating. That footnote should then read ""Activities held in one LDC or, in the case of regional activities, those activities to which at least 50 per cent of the participants were LDCs'. It was consequently necessary to recalculate the figures in the column on the extreme right of the table. In conclusion he referred to paragraph 5, subparagraph 6, which related to technical assistance for non-residents. It was essential that non- Geneva based Missions were kept abreast of the negotiations. Minutes of formal and informal meetings in the negotiating phase should therefore be sent to the non-resident Missions. It would also assist Geneva-based delegations that were not able to participate in particular meetings. Those concerns had to be taken on board in order for his delegation to agree to the document.","WTCOMTDM38.pdf","Secretariat, Director-General, Ravier, UNCTAD"
"3820",3820,"23","23.      The representative of the European Commission said that through the Plan was a good basis for future work, it still needed some more improvement. He pointed out that the Plan was important as it was the reflection of what the WTO would need to do in response to the Doha Ministerial Declaration. In addition, the Plan was an operational document for the expenditure to be incurred under the Doha Trust Fund. His delegation therefore attached importance for the Plan to be approved at the earliest so that it could be used as a basis for the Pledging Conference on 11 March 2002. He said he believed that more should be done to clearly address the Doha commitments. He would appreciate if the activities which responded to the individual paragraphs of the Declaration were made more apparent. The column which had been added to the Annex which pointed to the relevant paragraph was a good start but did not allow delegations to understand what was being done in the different specific areas. For instance, he suggested that what was being done on implementation should be clearly defined. Paragraph 14 of the Implementation Decision adopted at the Doha Ministerial Conference made implementation a priority of WTO's work on technical assistance and capacity-building. He said that his delegation agreed that the WTO should cooperate closely with other international agencies and noted the work was under way in this regard. The WTO should also cooperate with bilateral donors, with training institutes and other activists in the field. That could be worked out in greater detail. The Plan still gave the impression that almost everything was being done by the WTO itself, which he felt was not the intention at the outset. His delegation attached importance to effective coordination between the WTO, other agencies in Geneva and across the Atlantic, and with the main donors. He said he thought that the WTO could build on the experience which the ITC had in sectors such as SPS and TBT. He asked if the Secretariat had given more thought as to what could be done on-line rather than sending officials abroad. He pointed out that in training institutes in Europe, in management institutions and in universities, a lot of training was done on-line and that was experiences the WTO could build on. He went on to say that it was his delegation's understanding that many of the short missions and the participation of WTO officials in meetings should not have been listed one by one. That inflated the number of activities. The 450 or so activities listed would appear to be exaggerated if every single mission of a WTO official was regarded as a capacity-building or technical assistance activity. The Plan had to give full attention to the Singapore issues. Annex 1 of the document was superficial and did not, for example, reflect recent cooperation between UNCTAD and WTO on investment. The Singapore issues was an area where negotiating capacity for developing countries was crucial and he hoped that this could be reflected in the document. With respect to the costing he noted that the Plan as such did not provide WT/COMTD/M/38 Page 10 any figures. He was therefore grateful for DDG Stoler's input. However, Members had to get an idea of the total figures distributed among the different activities. The Plan itself should have given a clearer idea of the cost of different activities. That should include a better idea of the importance attached to the Singapore issues as well as a clearer view of WTO participation in activities which were jointly carried out with other international organizations. Finally he said he agreed with Deputy Director-General Ravier that the Plan had to be dynamic and that it had to evolve with the experience which was being gained. His delegation would favour a clear arrangement which would allow the Secretariat and the Members to keep track of how the plan was being implemented. His delegation was ready to assist the Secretariat in every way and was confident that in doing so the Plan could be endorsed in the future.","WTCOMTDM38.pdf","European, Commission, WTO, Doha, Trust, Fund, Doha, Doha, Ministerial, Conference, WTO, WTO, WTO, WTO, WTO, Geneva, Atlantic, WTO, ITC, TBT, Secretariat, Europe, WTO, WTO, WTO, Singapore, UNCTAD, WTO, Singapore, Stoler, Members, Singapore, WTO, Director-General, Ravier, Secretariat, Members, Secretariat"
"3821",3821,"24","24.      The representative of the United States said that she appreciated the effort the Secretariat had made in further revising the Annual Plan and appreciated that Deputy Director-General Ravier had clarified the understanding that the Secretariat was still not looking for an approval of the document. Her delegation looked forward to participating in the discussions with the Budget Committee, and appreciate Deputy Director-General Stoler's information on costings. Her delegation's understanding was that the Plan reflected Members' requests for assistance which had resulted in the compilation of activities that the Secretariat was planning. The Plan did not provide a qualitative basis on which to measure the effectiveness of the activities undertaken, nor to understand precisely what kind of assistance was being provided and the link to particular objectives, whether based on commitments taken at the Doha Ministerial Conference, or objectives based on already existing commitments. One of the points that had been made by the recipients in other meetings was that general seminars might not be the most appropriate way to in deliver technical assistance. She recognized that what might work in one country or region might not work in others. Delegations had also mentioned that their different levels of development in different fields meant that the assistance provided might have to vary from issue to issue and agreement to agreement. She was anxious to hear further from others about how the assistance worked on the ground. She suggested that, to further enhance the objectives in the document, the CTD should authorise its Chairperson to consult with chairpersons of other WTO bodies, committees and negotiating groups with a technical assistance element to find out if those various bodies would put technical assistance and capacity building as a regular item on their agendas in order for delegations to be regularly updated and for linkages to be made as the activities proceeded rather than having an end of the year rush to pull together what existed, what was happening and what might need to be done. Her delegation had already found that in the past years various WTO bodies dealt with technical assistance. That would become even more diverse with the new negotiating structures. Other WTO bodies had been carrying out hands on technical assistance and had been working well with other organizations, standards organizations, and customs organizations and had provided effective technical assistance. The preparation that had been done in the SPS area was a good example. It would be critical that the CTD maintained a link with the other bodies to make it easier for Members to evaluate the technical assistance activities during the ongoing year and the coming ones.","WTCOMTDM38.pdf","United, States, Secretariat, Director-General, Ravier, Secretariat, Budget, Committee, Director-General, Stoler, Members, Secretariat, CTD, Chairperson, WTO, WTO, WTO, SPS, CTD, Members"
"3822",3822,"25","25.      She went on to say that the revised Plan contained improvements, such as the chart linking some of the activities to paragraphs of the Doha Ministerial Declaration. Trade facilitation was mentioned only a few times in the various listings even though. Her delegation knew from bilateral discussions that a number of governments had requested assistance in the area of trade facilitation. However, she recognized that the listings only represented requests which had been made. Nevertheless notwithstanding what Members had in the Doha Ministerial Declaration, assistance in the area of trade facilitation was something that the WTO should coordinate with other agencies. She agreed with the Ambassador of Zambia on the importance of coordination with other multilateral agencies. More thought should be put into what other organizations could contribute to in joint efforts. She emphasized that a certain amount of bilateral technical assistance was always available globally and appreciated the setting up of a database that would make it easy for beneficiaries to know exactly what was being provided bilaterally. A lot of the bilateral assistance was directly trade-                                                                                     WT/COMTD/M/38                                                                                            Page 11 related. However, her delegation had sometimes found that representatives of different beneficiaries might not always be aware of the assistance provided on the ground. There was a need for more coordination on the ground to recognize the linkages. More could be done on-line and that this might be useful for providing some training on-line, a tool she said should be explored. On the issue of the Pledging Conference, her delegation sought clarification on whether Ministers were expected to attend. She also asked for updated information regarding who was invited. In other meetings, delegations had indicated they wished to contribute in kind. All contributions were equally important and it should be ensured that the Pledging Conference was inclusive in this respect. The focus of the Conference was on the Global Trust Fund and her Government was ready to make its contribution of US$1 million and was in the process of discussing with the Secretariat the transfer of other funds into that pool.","WTCOMTDM38.pdf","Members, WTO, Ambassador, Zambia, Secretariat"
"3823",3823,"26","26.      The representative of Norway said that her country would be interested in continuing discussions on how the Plan evolved. Her delegation sought a coordinated approach to technical assistance and wished to avoid overlap, duplication and any differences between international organizations and other bodies, about which agency was most competent in the different areas. It had to be ensured that everything was covered and that there was no lacunae. It was important that the Plan and the proposed activities were clear, as should be their connection to the commitments made at the Doha Ministerial Conference. She said that many delegations had stressed the importance of coordination with other multilateral institutions, but it was important that Members knew which those organizations were. The database would be important in that context as it would provide information about who was doing what. It was not only UNCTAD which carried out activities of interest. Members should give thought to the suggestion made to have technical assistance dealt with on the agendas of the different bodies as they had a more hands on approach to the questions concerned. It was important that the programme be followed up and that it be made as concrete as possible. She said that her delegation had asked itself what the WTO’s role would be in the IF process and what the follow-up should be. She felt that there seemed to be an imbalance in the distribution of activities in the Plan. She noted what the delegation of India had said on Annex 5, and agreed that issue should be looked into. She continued by saying that when it came to identifying the activities that addressed the different commitments in Doha Ministerial Declaration, it was important that there was more focus on the Singapore issues, than the Plan currently seemed to have. It was also important because the Plan was a living document and as delegations went into negotiations and analysis of the different issues there would be more demands from delegations for assistance in those areas.","WTCOMTDM38.pdf","Norway, Doha, Ministerial, Conference, Members, UNCTAD, Members, WTO, India, Doha, Singapore"

The representative of Tunisia said his delegation welcomed the new changes introduced in the Plan in light of the observations made by delegations in the last meeting of the CTD, in particular regarding the link between the Plan and the Doha Ministerial Declaration. His delegation supported what had been said by the delegations from Venezuela, Cuba and the Ambassador of Zambia for more cooperation with international organizations, in particular with UNCTAD since that organization had a long experience in the field of trade. He was concerned as his Government's requests had not being taken fully into consideration, since the activity planned to take place in Tunisia in the previous plan, had apparently been removed in the revised version. He requested the Secretariat to provide an explanation, preferably in written form.","WTCOMTDM38.pdf","Tunisia, CTD, Venezuela, Cuba, Ambassador, Zambia, UNCTAD, Tunisia, Secretariat"
"3825",3825,"28","28.       The representative of Belize said he thought it was critical to ensure that what was delivered corresponded to the needs of the Members. However, Members had an important role to play in that regard. The technical assistance to be provided over the next two to three years seemed to involve a range of interconnected activities of both donors and partners. That raised the question of how the divergent expectations could be assessed and how those divergences would be addressed. That was critical in ensuring the success of the WTO’s Technical Assistance Plan. It was important to consider what would happen in the period subsequent to the capacity-building phase. He was concerned that a number of Members who were eager to integrate their respective trade strategies into the multilateral trading system in a fashion that would allow them to realize their respective development objectives, WT/COMTD/M/38 Page 12 would be faced with various constraints. Members expressing a will to integrate should be provided with opportunities and support to do so. He suggested an analysis of the constraints of trade, in particular of how it related to the developmental needs and interests of the countries that would benefit from technical assistance and capacity-building. He said that he had only raised this issue as a way of identifying means of identifying how those countries could be facilitated in further integrating into the multinational trading system. He supported the suggestion made by the representative of the United States of having the Chairman coordinate with the Chairmen of other bodies to ensure that there was homogeneity with regards to the delivery of technical assistance.","WTCOMTDM38.pdf","Belize, Members, Members, WTO, Members, Members, United, States, Chairman"
"3826",3826,"29","29.      The representative of Malaysia said that the language in Annex 1 of the Plan gave the impression that Members had already agreed that negotiations would take place on the Singapore issues. He said that that was a decision for the Members to take. The matter should not be prejudged by the Secretariat because, according to the Doha Ministerial Declaration, it was clear that Members were to decide on how and what they would do with the Singapore issues at the Fifth Ministerial Conference. Delegations could not, at this point in time, accept that it be stated that the technical assistance provided should be geared towards negotiations in those issues. He agreed with the proposal that there should be coordination between the Committee and the other bodies in the WTO so that Members knew what each body was doing, in order to avoid duplication of technical assistance. He asked whether there was a deadline for agreeing to a final document in view of the imminent holding of the Pledging Conference. The Plan should be finalized as soon as possible and scheduled activities should not be put on hold. He add that these activities could be implemented even though the document had not been approved. He further asked that if a final CTD document was approved by the General Council, did it mean that no further requests could be made for technical assistance, or if, since it was a living document, changes, amendments and additions could still be made as Governments needs changed. He stressed that the possibility to change the Plan through the course of the year should exist. In addition he sought clarification as to whether, when further changes were made, the costing would be adjusted accordingly and how a possible shortfall in available resources would be dealt with. In connection to what had been said concerning the role of other international organizations he believed that information on the work being undertaken by other international organizations would be helpful. As most technical assistance to his Government was channelled through the WTO, information on other agencies in Malaysia which may have requested technical assistance directly from other international organizations, would be useful. The WTO’s role would therefore be a clearing-house of some kind. He asked if the activities of other international organizations were to be included in the document, would it be for information only, or if the WTO would have an overseeing role so that Members would have to go through the WTO to request assistance from other international organizations.","WTCOMTDM38.pdf","Malaysia, Members, Singapore, Members, Secretariat, Members, Singapore, Committee, WTO, Members, CTD, General, Council, WTO, Malaysia, WTO, WTO, Members, WTO"

"3828",3828,"30","30.      The representative of China noted the remarks made by Mr. Ravier with respect to cooperation between the WTO and other international organizations, including the relevant UN bodies, in delivering technical cooperation to developing country Members. Such cooperation and partnerships were important as the organizations carried out complementary activities. Members should make full use of the comparative advantages of all international organizations. He referred to the tables in the Plan and sought clarification regarding the content of the fourth column entitled ""Cooperation with"". He said that, for example, on page 31 projects for Cambodia had been listed, while in the fourth column it was mentioned that this would be in cooperation with UNCTAD. He was unsure whether that activity was sponsored by the WTO with the cooperation of the UNCTAD Secretariat or whether it was sponsored by UNCTAD with the cooperation of the WTO Secretariat. That had to be made clear, otherwise it would create a precedent as to which other activities might be included in the tables. He concluded by saying that there could be amendments to the Plan later and that there could always be room for improvement during its implementation. There was therefore no need to continue to work on revisions as it would be too time-consuming. A Plan was a Plan and there was no such thing as a perfect Plan. The Secretariat had to be given a certain amount of flexibility in its implementation of the Plan.

He pointed out that only eight African countries were beneficiaries of the JITAP and the JITAP had its own activities. The programme would in principle end in June 2002, although it might be extended. He asked if the title implied that the activities in the technical assistance Plan for countries which were beneficiaries of JITAP would be carried out within the framework of the JITAP. If that was the case, the Missions should have been alerted to tell their Governments to adjust the activities of the JITAP in cooperation with the executing agencies of which WTO was a prominent one.","WTCOMTDM38.pdf","Ghana, WTO"
"3830",3830,"32","32.       The representative of Switzerland said he had five brief points. Firstly, he said that his delegation was satisfied with the share of technical activities directed to the LDCs, which represented 50 per cent of the total. However, he supported the suggestion made by the representative of India that the figure might be deceiving. He asked the Secretariat to assure that the share of 50 per cent in favour of LDCs was established. Secondly, his delegation supported the view expressed that all areas identified in the Doha Ministerial Declaration for technical assistance should be supported equally from the Global Trust Fund, including the Singapore issues. Thirdly, his delegation was concerned about how the Members could provide support to the Secretariat in its endeavours. He explicitly called for the ad hoc requests to be limited to the barest minimum. Fourthly, he asked whether the large number of activities planned could really be carried out with the in-house staff available. It was still an open question to Members as how the priorities should be established if it became clear that all the activities could not be carried out with the human resources at the disposal in the Secretariat. Lastly, he said his delegation hoped to receive information on the work and methodology of the newly created unit of the Technical Cooperation Audit.","WTCOMTDM38.pdf","Switzerland, LDCs, India, Secretariat, Singapore, Members, Secretariat, Members, Secretariat, Technical, Cooperation, Audit"
"3831",3831,"33","33.      The representative of Canada said her delegation recognized that further work was required and supported the proposal for linkages with other WTO bodies by having them put technical assistance and capacity-building on their agenda. She welcomed the first efforts to deliver on the Plan and cooperate with other organizations. There were many appropriate and important organizations that should be mentioned in the Plan such as UNCTAD, UNEP, FAO, WIPO, UNIDO, APEC, IDB, the Asian Development Bank and the World Bank. The Heads of Agency meeting of the Integrated Framework was a good idea in that respect. However, she recalled that the IF was a tripartite relationship between the agencies, the donors and the LDCs and said that it might be appropriate to invite at least the Chair of the IF Steering Committee, and/or the two donor and two LDC representatives to attend that meeting as the perspectives of all should be heard.","WTCOMTDM38.pdf","Canada, WTO, UNCTAD, UNEP, FAO, WIPO, UNIDO, APEC, IDB, Asian, Development, Bank, World, Bank, Integrated, Framework, LDCs, IF, Steering, Committee, LDC"
"3832",3832,"34","34.      The representative of Pakistan said that technical cooperation and capacity-building were core activities of the WTO as confirmed by the Doha Ministerial Declaration. The negotiations agreed at the Doha Ministerial Conference and the recommendation of continuing the work programme on the Singapore issues and other subjects made it crucial that an effective technical assistance and capacity- building strategy be put in place. The Coordinated WTO Secretariat Annual Technical Assistance Plan for 2002 was a testimony of the fact that the Secretariat attached importance to technical assistance and capacity-building. The Revised Plan appeared to be a good basis. However, even if technical assistance and capacity-building were important, they were only one side of the development dimension of the multilateral trading system. More important was the need to inject a development dimension into the rules and disciplines, both in the existing ones and in those which Members would agree on in the future. There should be no presumption of any negotiations on issues on which there was no Ministerial mandate. He therefore supported the views expressed by the representative of India. Suggestions made by the representative of the United States regarding on-line training were good and merited consideration. He said he was surprised that other WTO bodies had not been consulted in the preparation of the Plan. There was a need for maintaining greater coordination with other WTO bodies in order for Members to get effective assistance from the Plan. He went on to say that one-day seminars might not be the best way to achieve the desired goal. In that regard, the importance of objective and analytic research studies and hands-on training could not WT/COMTD/M/38 Page 14 be over-emphasized. He looked forward to a final document which would take into account the concerns expressed by the various delegations. He concluded by saying that all Members were allocating resources, both human and financial, for the implementation of the activities, and he hoped that the Secretariat would put in place some sort of auditing or monitoring system which would ensure the effectiveness of the Plan and enable periodic evaluations of its effectiveness.","WTCOMTDM38.pdf","Pakistan, WTO, Doha, Ministerial, Conference, Singapore, WTO, Secretariat, Secretariat, Members, India, United, States, WTO, WTO, Members, Members, Secretariat"
"3833",3833,"35","35.      The representative of Egypt asked for clarification with respect to the three other levels of technical cooperation. The response to his question might respond to some of the concerns raised by others with respect to the cooperation with UNCTAD. The second level of cooperation was referred to in the second indent of paragraph 2 on page 3 of the revised Plan. He asked whether a document would be published by the WTO regarding that level of cooperation as well as regarding the cooperation with the OECD mentioned in subparagraph 4 of paragraph 2. He said that he was aware that UNCTAD had already drafted a document regarding technical cooperation with respect to the Doha Ministerial Declaration and he believed that that document had been drafted in close cooperation with the WTO Secretariat. If he had understood the Plan, it referred exclusively to activities to be delivered by the WTO Secretariat, and as was stated in the document ""to an extent in coordination with multilateral agencies with related competence"". If everything was taken together delegations would get a complete view of all ongoing activities and the degree of coordination and cooperation that had been established among agencies.","WTCOMTDM38.pdf","Egypt, UNCTAD, WTO, OECD, UNCTAD, WTO, Secretariat, WTO, Secretariat"
"3834",3834,"36","36.      The representative of Indonesia said that his delegation shared the concern expressed by the delegations of India and Malaysia with regard to the wording in paragraph 1 of Annex 1 of the Plan. He sought clarification on Annex 5 of the Plan which showed the number of planned activities per region. The figures in one column gave the percentage of region over subtotal. The percentage for the Asian/Pacific region was 20 per cent whereas the number of countries and the share of the world population located in the Asian/Pacific region was much larger. He therefore asked what the rational for the 20 per cent figure was.","WTCOMTDM38.pdf","Indonesia, India, Malaysia"
"3835",3835,"37","37.     The Ambassador of Paraguay said that, even though the statements had been substantive, his delegation still felt that if the Committee continued to review the Coordinated WTO Technical Assistance Plan, they would reach the end of the year without developing countries having received the technical cooperation they needed in order to be able to participate in the work programme arising out of the Fourth Ministerial Conference. His delegation wished to see the Plan enforced and believed that necessary adjustments could be introduced as its implementation progressed. He quoted the Spanish saying “perfection is the enemy of the good” as he believed that the Plan was already good. A number of activities had been scheduled for February 2002, including one in Paraguay. It was important to commence the activities already scheduled in the Plan and not to wait until the Plan was perfect. It was better to enforce the Plan as it was and to introduce the adjustments as the need arose.","WTCOMTDM38.pdf","Ambassador, Paraguay, Committee, Coordinated, WTO, Technical, Assistance, Plan, Paraguay"
"3836",3836,"38","38.      The representative of Bolivia said that he agreed with many of the comments made regarding improvements and felt that these could be introduced as the Plan was implemented. If Members considered the ambitious objectives set out in the Doha Ministerial Declaration and felt that the assistance provided in the Plan would not meet their requirements, they could say so. However, his delegation recognized that what was in the Plan was as much as could be reasonably expected from the WTO Secretariat. The Plan did have a strong capacity strengthening and training component. He agreed with other delegations about the need to start implementing the Plan at the earliest. During the implementation of the seminars and courses in the Plan, it might be useful for developing countries if the WTO Secretariat could coordinate with other specialized agencies that had particular knowledge in the given areas. It would be also important to ensure a multiplying effect in the beneficiary countries, by working in cooperation with local institutes that dealt with trade matters and with local training institutes. That would not involve changing the guidelines of the Plan. A multiplying effect could be achieved by finding different local entities that might be able to disseminate the information                                                                                    WT/COMTD/M/38                                                                                           Page 15 the WTO was providing. If the Member concerned agreed, other methods such as the internet and other means to reach a broader public could be used.","WTCOMTDM38.pdf","Bolivia, Members, WTO, Secretariat, WTO, Secretariat, WTO, Member"
"3837",3837,"39","39.      Deputy Director General, Mr Andrew Stoler said that a question had been posed regarding whether it would be possible to fully cover some of the Singapore issues such as trade and investment in the global financial envelope. He responded that this may be possible provided it was possible to marginally increase the CHF 15 million associated with the Doha Development Agenda Global Trust Fund. There might actually not even be a need for CHF 16.3 to achieve all activities as the Secretariat had been conservative in the estimates of what the cost-sharing arrangements would contribute. He said that delegations would recall that, at the end of 2001 the Secretariat had asked donors who had contributed money into the existing trust funds whether they would agree to roll over that money into the DDAGTF for 2002. A number of them had agreed to do that. Others had raised some queries. However, it meant the fund was not starting from zero in terms of the amount that was needed at the Pledging Conference. On the issue of having a more detailed ventilation of the figures given on a global basis, he said that the copies of his remarks which had been distributed referred to the standard used costing that the Secretariat had used in arriving at the estimates of costs of the individual activities. It would show what the relative costs of the individual activities in the document were. However, delegations would not be able to see what exactly the cost-sharing would be with some of the agencies with which there was a cooperative effort. On the point raised about whether the figures could go up or not, his answer was clearly yes. He said that the Secretariat saw the CHF 15 million or even the CHF 16.3 million as a conservative estimate of what would be the absolute minimum to accomplish the planned activities. The numbers represented the minimum funding required for the existing set of planned activities. If delegations were willing to contribute more to the Trust Fund through the pledging exercise, new activities could be identified, provided that the Secretariat had the capacity to deliver in terms of its own resources or outsourced resources. Lastly, in response to what would happen in the event of a shortfall, he reminded delegations that it was in order to deal with exactly such a possibility that a buffer account of CHF 1 million had been provided for in the Global Trust Fund as agreed to in 2001 by the General Council. That buffer account was intended to deal with a situation in which there was a temporary shortfall in contributions received from delegations.","WTCOMTDM38.pdf","Director, Andrew, Stoler, Singapore, Doha, Development, Agenda, Global, Trust, Fund, Secretariat, Secretariat, Secretariat, Secretariat, Secretariat, General, Council"

The Chairman recalled that, at previous sessions of CTD it had been agreed to invite the following inter-governmental organizations on an ad hoc meeting by meeting basis: the Arab Maghreb Union (AMU), the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS), the Economic Corporation Organization (ECO), the Inter-Arab Investment Guarantee Corporation, the Islamic Development Bank (IDB), the Organization of African Unity (OAU), the Organization of the Islamic Conference, (OIC) the South Centre, the South Pacific Forum, the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), the West African Economic and Monetary Union (WAEMU), and the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO). He proposed that those Organizations be invited to the next formal meeting of CTD and that, in view of the forthcoming special sessions of the Committee on special and differential treatment, those Organizations be invited to any formal session held before the next regular session.","WTCOMTDM38.pdf","Chairman, CTD, Economic, Community, of, West, ECOWAS, Economic, Corporation, Organization, Inter-Arab, Investment, Guarantee, Corporation, Islamic, Development, Bank, IDB, Organization, of, African, Unity, OAU, OIC, South, Centre, South, Pacific, Forum, United, Nations, Environment, Programme, UNEP, West, African, Economic, and, Monetary, Union, WAEMU, World, Intellectual, Property, Organization, WIPO, CTD, Committee"
"3839",3839,"40","40.      Deputy Director-General, Mr Paul-Henri Ravier said that the status of the document was a procedural problem which needed clarification. The aim was not to spend the entire year to perfect the 2002 Plan but to implement it. About 13 per cent of the working year had already elapsed and only 11 per cent of the activities had been carried out. However, it was understandable since implementation was always slower early in any year. Nevertheless, it was not desirable to delay implementation of the Plan any further. He insisted that it was the Member's Plan, not the Secretariat’s. Revision 1 of the Plan was actually the sixth or eighth version as the Plan had been developed through consultations between the Secretariat and the Members. Such consultations had been held since the end of November 2001. Though the Plan could be improved on the basis of the remarks made by delegations, perfection may not be that easily achievable. The aim should be to have a working document of the Committee. He did not think that the objective should be to adopt the document formally on a consensus basis as that would delay its implementation. It was true that the CTD had other commitments and there were other essential issues to be debated in the CTD. It was not in the interest of the membership at large that the CTD became the management committee for technical assistance although that had not been the situation in the past. No matter how important technical assistance had become as a result of the Doha Ministerial Conference, he did not believe that it was the mission of the CTD to be exclusively occupied with technical assistance. Members should ideally take note of all the comments which had been made and for the Secretariat to remain open to further comments and remarks from the membership. He agreed with the notion that a plan is a plan and by its very definition must be amenable to changes. He said 10 to 15 per cent of the activities contained in the Plan would be cancelled in the course of the year for one reason or another and would be replaced by an equivalent number or a higher number of activities which were not yet planned. If Members were locked into a Plan adopted by consensus, every time an activity was cancelled or WT/COMTD/M/38 Page 16 added Members would have to meet in order to adjust the Plan. He did not think that this was what anybody wished to see happen.","WTCOMTDM38.pdf","Director-General, Paul-Henri, Ravier, Member, Secretariat, Secretariat, Members, Committee, CTD, CTD, CTD, CTD, Members, Secretariat, Members, Page, 16, Members"
"3840",3840,"41","41.      He went on to comment on the limitations and constraints in the Plan and its implementation. The limitations belonged to three or four broad categories: the number of activities, the cost of the activities and the human resources that could be devoted to the activities. The greater the number of activities the greater the cost and the greater the time devoted and therefore human resources required. The basic features of the Plan was that the number of regional activities was much higher than in the past. That had two direct consequences. From a financial point of view, it costed more per activity though less in terms of human resources. A regional activity was quite costly, even though a larger number of countries could be covered. That was one of the characteristics of the Plan and that was one of the ways in which the Secretariat was able to address these limitations. He took note of the suggestion that had been made regarding the implementation of on-line activities and said that the Secretariat would explore and take advantage of every possibility to use effective technological means in order to save time and money. However, it was entirely dependent on technology in that respect which for instance meant that on-line would depend on the weakest element of the chain, which in many countries was often telecommunications capacity.","WTCOMTDM38.pdf","Secretariat, Secretariat"
"3841",3841,"42","42.      Technical assistance had not begun on 1 January 2002; it was really a continuous effort. Therefore, neither in terms of activities nor in terms of coordination with other international agencies or with bilateral donors, had the Secretariat considered that it was starting from scratch. It was because technical assistance was part of a continuum that the Secretariat had not indicated which activities responded to each individual article of the Doha Ministerial Declaration. Members had also defined a number of needs prior to the Doha Ministerial Conference and there had to be continuity with respect to those activities. However, the Secretariat had taken note of the fact that Members wished the Secretariat to link the activities to the Doha Ministerial Declaration. He then went on to talk about coordination, indicating that there were different ways of pursuing coordination. He however emphasized that from the very beginning, two-thirds of the WTO’s technical assistance activities had been carried out in co-operation with a number of organizations, one of which was UNCTAD, which he believed after regional development banks was the WTO's main partner.","WTCOMTDM38.pdf","Secretariat, Secretariat, Members, Secretariat, Members, Secretariat, WTO, UNCTAD, WTO"
"3842",3842,"43","43.      Mr. Cheidu Osakwe, Director, Technical Cooperation Division said that it was possible to put the comments made into three categories: first, any consensus that was apparent in the remarks made by Members; secondly, the dilemmas and irreconcilable positions; and finally, the specific questions asked, including the request for clarifications. He began by saying there was obviously no consensus on the Plan as yet; if there had been it would have shown that the Plan was perfect. The possibility of a perfect plan simply did not exist. First there were the Singapore issues versus the traditional issues. Several Members had said that there should be more emphasis on the Singapore issues, and that the Plan be tuned to the negotiating agenda, others had said that this should not be done. Secondly, some members had asked the Secretariat to engage in a programme approach while others had asked for the activities to be more project-oriented. Thirdly, many of the providers had encouraged the consumers of technical assistance to identify their priorities and to list their needs. Yet, on the other hand many of the same members had said to the Secretariat that they did not want to see a list. The final dilemma was that between the strategies that Members wished to see anew and the strategy that Members had adopted in paragraph 38 of the Ministerial Declaration. He said the Secretariat welcomed discussions and would attempt to make the adjustments required by Members. However, Members had to recognize that there were divergences which the Secretariat could not bridge. It was up to the Members to bridge some of these dilemmas themselves.","WTCOMTDM38.pdf","Cheidu, Osakwe, Director, Technical, Cooperation, Division, Members, Singapore, Members, Singapore, Secretariat, Secretariat, Members, Members, Secretariat, Members, Members, Secretariat, Members"
"3843",3843,"44","44.     He continued to say that coordination had a cost and required enhanced capacities. The Secretariat would attempt to coordinate its activities and it was doing so within the IF. Deputy Director-General Ravier had given examples of the coordination exercises that the Secretariat had undertaken since the last meeting. The first was the 25 January trade and competition policy course;                                                                                     WT/COMTD/M/38                                                                                            Page 17 the second was a week thereafter on trade and investment. DDG Ravier had also referred to the coordination meeting on 19 February with regard to the technical assistance database. The Secretariat would continue such efforts. However, coordination was always not that simple and it was not coordination that limited the operational activities. For instance, in delivering a technical cooperation activity it was possible to find two different organizations taking different positions on subsidies, one encouraging subsidies and the other organization discouraging it. It therefore had to be recognized that there was a limit to the coordination including in the context of the limitation of mandates, capacity and resources of different organizations. Moreover, coordination was not limited to inter- agency coordination. There should be coordination amongst donors, coordination amongst agencies and coordination amongst beneficiary countries. He went on to the issue of UNCTAD and said that the WTO Secretariat was not in a position to address the question of the role of UNCTAD. However, he could confirm that the WTO and UNCTAD Secretariats were working together in a constructive, positive and practical manner and wished to continue to do so. With regard to regional institutions he referred to the statement by the Director-General in the General Council on 13 February 2002. Connections had been established and were being established with the many regional agencies and commissions. There would be a meeting of the Inter-American Development Bank and the WTO on 27 February 2002. They would be working together and other agencies had been invited, as well as some of the coordinators of informal groups within the WTO. Together they would see how they could make best use of the best practices of each. On the issue of the strategy, he said the Secretariat has proceeded on the basis of the strategy endorsed in paragraph 38. On the point made with regard to presumption of negotiations in certain areas, he clarified that no such presumptions had been made. The Plan for technical assistance activities was not a negotiating document. Essentially, what it contained was references to the Strategy for WTO technical cooperation and a listing of operational activities. The Plan was based on Members' demands. He said the Secretariat had a compilation of the requests from Members for activities, both written and requests made by telephone. The Secretariat was prepared to making them available to any delegation who wished to see the requests.","WTCOMTDM38.pdf","Secretariat, Director-General, Ravier, Secretariat, Ravier, Secretariat, UNCTAD, WTO, Secretariat, UNCTAD, WTO, UNCTAD, Director-General, General, Council, Inter-American, Development, Bank, WTO, WTO, Secretariat, WTO, Members, Secretariat, Members, Secretariat"
"3844",3844,"45","45.     He went on to say that on the issue of seminars he had not fully understood the problem with the use of this tool for technical assistance. For example there could be a request for WTO resource persons to show members how to schedule commitments for specific commitments on trade in services. Seminars spanned the gamut of such activities. They could be of a general nature or they could be of a technical nature. However, he knew the issue was tied to the LDCs' position that the Secretariat should deal with supply-side matters based on the Ministerial Declaration. The LDCs argued that they could make that case because there was a mandate in paragraph 42 and 43 of the Doha Ministerial Declaration. Secondly, some work had been undertaken within the IF which involved complementary work by other agencies, as there were issues that the WTO could not undertake on its own. On the question on the follow-up to the IF pilot scheme, which was currently under way in three countries he said that it would be extended to approximately five more LDCs and that an issue that still remained was the follow-up to some of the priority technical assistance recommendations arising from that. His final point was on the question of whether the Doha Development Agenda also covered the Singapore issues. He said it did, as it would cover all the issues and mandates that were listed in the table on page 6 of the Plan. There were several other limited questions, that he would take up with individual delegations such as the question by the representative of Ghana on the applicability of technical assistance activities for African countries with the JITAP and the clarification sought by the representative of China. The implementation of the Plan would continue as soon as consensus was reached on areas of improvement.","WTCOMTDM38.pdf","WTO, Secretariat, LDCs, WTO, Doha, Development, Agenda, Singapore, Ghana, China"
"3845",3845,"46","46.      The representative of the United States said that as the WTO also had an e-commerce agenda which cross-cutted into various different bodies it was important that wherever there was the opportunity to use on-line resources, the WTO should be prepared to do so. She mentioned the fact that the agenda included a presentation by a developing country to explain its experience on the use of electronic commerce. The ITC had been extremely proactive in taking advantage of on-line tools to be able to train and to show developing countries how to use the on-line process to access markets. WT/COMTD/M/38 Page 18 She hoped that on-line aspects would not become such a weak link that her delegation had to question the initiatives. Her delegation appreciated the element contained in the Plan related to video- conferencing but noticed that there was a conditionality attached to video-conferencing as the WTO Secretariat had to use video-conferencing even for its internal work in coordinating with other agencies interested in trade. The Secretariat could not necessarily meet the demand even if it wanted to. Weak links existed in all missions and at all kinds of places, even in developed countries. However, it was important to move along this line with the technology available and with the recognition that it would be possible to further progress as the technology became more widespread and available. On the Singapore issues she agreed with the Secretariat and said that it was important to recognize the sensitivities. There should be language that covered both views of the issue since this was an area seriously negotiated at the Doha Ministerial Conference.","WTCOMTDM38.pdf","United, States, WTO, WTO, ITC, WTO, Secretariat, Secretariat, Singapore, Secretariat, Doha, Ministerial, Conference"
"3846",3846,"47","47.      The representative of the European Communities said that his delegation disagreed fundamentally with the Secretariat as it still could not fully see how the change of priorities which should have come about from the Doha Ministerial Declaration and the Decisions was reflected in the Plan. A Plan should be the Members’ Plan. He had consulted with the Secretariat and had made numerous comments on how the Plan should be structured. He had no disagreement with any other Member on the content of the Plan, but he did tell that it was time that the Members were a bit more proactive and got another chance to comment on the document. His delegation did not want to micro- manage anything or stop the Secretariat from implementing the activities which were on call. However, he wished to see a Plan that was politically useable and which fully reflected what had been agreed to at the Doha Ministerial Conference. The Plan, as it was presented, did not represent the sort of response which his delegation was looking for. The dilemma, for example, on the Singapore issues was a simple question of presentation. There was no disagreement that there would be several activities linked to the issues in paragraph 23 of the Doha Ministerial Declaration. The only question was what to do with paragraph 21 and the illusion given that a decision had already been taken to negotiate these issues. That was also a question of presentation. There was no fundamental disagreement that something had to be done on the Singapore issues. He did not accept the argument that there was a dilemma which made the Plan impossible to change or presented with more information on cooperation with other international organizations. He asked why there could not be a section on industrial tariffs which some delegations had asked for, as there was one on investment. Members were clear on the sort of action which they wished to see. However, that did not mean that everything had to be done from scratch. It was important to make the Plan a tool which allowed Members to track various themes throughout the year. His delegation could agree to take note of the Plan. However, there had to be a change of focus in the WTO. That was why he had said that the Plan should be endorsed, not just be taken note of. As the Pledging Conference was to take place in three weeks time, his delegation could not endorse the Plan in its current form as the basic document for that Conference. These issues should be resolved quickly in an informal process to arrive at a Plan which corresponded to the political imperatives which Members were working under, after the Doha Ministerial Conference.","WTCOMTDM38.pdf","European, Communities, Secretariat, Members, Secretariat, Member, Members, Secretariat, Doha, Ministerial, Conference, Singapore, Singapore, Members, Members, WTO, Members, Doha, Ministerial, Conference"

The representative of the European Communities said that though he did not represent a developing country, the systematic approach which the Government of Costa Rica had adopted was probably of interest to all Members. It was clear that the telecommunications infrastructure in Costa Rica was already good, an important element in implementing any programme of e-commerce. He asked how that had been achieved and what sort of problems the Government of Costa Rica had encountered and in which way it had gone about ensuring such a high coverage of access and such a good infrastructure.","WTCOMTDM38.pdf","European, Communities, Costa, Rica, Members, Costa, Rica, Costa, Rica"

"3854",3854,"54","54.     Mrs. Mariel Picado referred to the question regarding the system of telecommunications and said that the coverage was high and that there was a Costa Rican electricity company which was responsible for the service. It had been in operation for many years in Costa Rica and its 95 per cent coverage had made it possible to reach areas located far from any centres; including distant rural areas which otherwise would not have had access. The Costa Rican Electricity Institute was the one responsible for telecommunications and electricity. The internet infrastructure had been made available to the majority of the population and she underlined the fact that one of the important questions being studied at the present time in Costa Rica was the quest of an advanced internet network. As indicated in her presentation, they would probably use optic fibre rings across the board in the country, thus taking advantage of the copper-based network which would make it possible to integrate the transmission of voice and images at high speed and thus reduce the costs of the connections and ensure access because of the wider band width. On the question of tourism she said that tourism was important to Costa Rica's economy. Different websites were being developed in order to promote Costa Rica as a tourist centre and to indicate the various services available in the different areas and sites of the country. She said the Government had created one main entry point to Costa Rica on the Internet.","WTCOMTDM38.pdf","Mariel, Picado, Costa, Rica, Costa, Rican, Electricity, Institute, Costa, Rica, Costa, Rica, Costa, Rica, Costa, Rica"

The representative of Rwanda said that it appeared that the example of Costa Rica was a demonstration of a new era of development, similar to the industrial revolution which had its roots in England and then had gone to the West and then into Japan and other eastern countries. There was already a gap between the West and the rest of the World and it seemed that if a country did not take advantage of the new electronic means, another cleavage would be created. Since his delegation was interested in the use of those new electronic means he asked what percentage of the investment was by the State and what percentage was private investment, in the extension and expansion of the electronics market. It seemed that it was a nationwide programme. He went on to ask what the WT/COMTD/M/38 Page 20 likelihood was of success in a developing country where the degree of illiteracy was high and where the telecommunications services were underdeveloped. He also asked what advice she could give to the Governments of such countries.","WTCOMTDM38.pdf","Rwanda, Costa, Rica, England, West, Japan"

The representative of Senegal asked if in Costa Rica there was an electronic customs clearance in operation and if that was the case, what the repercussions of it had been on the speed of customs procedures and on the costs of customs clearance. He said that at a time when greater facility in exchange was being discussed, it was good that some countries did use electronic means in the customs sphere. It would be useful if delegations could get more information and some figures on the impact of the use of electronic means on customs clearance procedures.","WTCOMTDM38.pdf","Senegal, Costa, Rica"
"3857",3857,"57","57.      Mrs Mariel Picado of Costa Rica said that with regard to the proportion of the investment which came from the public and the private sectors in the expansion of e-commerce she wished to give a few examples. She mentioned the work being done by a Foundation which was developing a number of initiatives in order to make fuller use of electronic technology such as the use of computers. That Foundation had tried to generalize and develop a culture of informatics and improve knowledge of informatics through a number of initiatives, such as education. Another important project was ""Communications without Borders"" which was one of the most important projects in which they were involved. It was an area in which there was a possibility of integrating the private and public sectors in order to widen the use of electronic technologies. It was in that connection her Government was developing telecentres which were equipped in order to ensure that there was widespread access to computers and internet. Agreements were being entered into between the communal and municipal associations which were providing the funding and societies which were responsible for the training. There were training centres for instructors which ensured specialized training in the field of electronics. That was something which would back up the national industry. It was a question of giving more training to the already existing skilled personnel in order to help them to produce more and better software. Lack of adequate infrastructure was an obstacle to the development of e-commerce. She said the Government of Costa Rica had taken various initiatives to improve the infrastructure and to enhance the broadband capacity necessary for on-line transactions. There were also a number of other initiatives under way. Another way of improving infrastructure would be to seek alliances with other sectors in society such as the academia and the private sector. It was important that there be a response at the legislative level as well so that the necessary reforms could be made in infrastructure area. Her Government was making an effort to improve connections throughout the country. It had ensured that the cable services expanded the possibility for connections. That process had gone in parallel with the so-called informatics culture. Even if the infrastructure was in place, appropriate use had to be made of it. There was for example a free countrywide e-mail service and there had been a broad campaign to make people aware of the existence of it. The aim was to familiarize the population with the use of electronic information technology so that they would learn how to use those services. The Government had thought that the best way of doing so was through an information campaign through which for example people would learn about the various possibilities in order to make them interested and for them to start using the service. On the customs question, she said that the Government of Costa Rica was making efforts to improve the situation with the help of new information technologies. There was an internet page which made it possible to consult decrees, administrative materials and circulars, as well as all issues and information necessary for customs procedures. There was also the possibility of consulting jurisprudence and there was information on tariff classifications, restrictions, prohibitions as well as information regarding imports and exports. With respect to customs clearance, she said that the Government had a single digital window for exports, though it did not as yet have a single window for imports. However, the Government was looking for systems which would make it possible to speed up custom processes and customs clearance.

"3861",3861,"60","60.      Mr. Patrick Low, Director, Development and Economic Research Division said that the Secretariat had drawn up a preliminary programme and was in the process of looking for speakers. The draft programme was made available to Members and was divided into four sessions, three shorter ones in the morning and a longer one in the afternoon. The first session in the morning would consider recent data trends in e-commerce, particularly at international exchange through electronic means. The second session would focus on revenue implications and the effects of e-commerce on prospects of governments of collecting revenue, different revenue sources, focusing particularly on the development aspects of the issues and would also touch on the question of what was available in terms of information technology to assist in the collection of revenue and identification of liability. The third session in the morning would address some of those issues from a WTO perspective. The Trade in Services Division would make a presentation as it was that area in which e-commerce had been most discussed in the WTO context. In the afternoon session two or three governments would present their experiences of e-commerce in relation to the revenue issue and how they saw the difficulties and challenges. Some private sector entities would also be invited to speak on the subject. He said he hoped that the programme would provide a clear idea of the issues connected to the revenue implications of e-commerce and the challenges for revenue collection. The Secretariat would ensure that there was time for discussion and questions and answers. He invited any delegation who felt that it had an experience to share with respect to revenue implications of e-commerce to let the Secretariat know so that it could be included in the programme. He also said that the Secretariat would welcome any suggestions and guidance from delegations as to who they might approach in a private sector.","WTCOMTDM38.pdf","Patrick, Low, Director, Development, and, Economic, Research, Division, Secretariat, Members, WTO, Trade, in, Services, Division, WTO, Secretariat, Secretariat, Secretariat"

The representative of the European Commission said he was made aware that especially on direct taxes a lot of work had been done elsewhere, including in the OECD and he invited the Secretariat to draw on their expertise if it had not already done so. Duplication of efforts could be avoided if the Secretariat looked closely at what had already been done. Where government revenue was mentioned, he preferred the discussions to be more comprehensive and include the additional revenues which would accrue from using all the benefits and possible gains from electronic commerce, including for example how the development of e-commerce would affect government revenue. It should include possible growth and possible additional services being rendered possible in a country which used electronic commerce.","WTCOMTDM38.pdf","European, Commission, OECD, Secretariat, Secretariat"

He added that in the chapter on trade, the draft text of the Monterrey Consensus had proposed a summit welcoming the implementation of the WTO decisions which had placed the needs and interests of developing countries at the centre of a WTO work programme and outlined the issues of concern to developing countries. Among other things he said that the draft text of the Monterrey Consensus had also recognized the importance of enhanced and predictable access for the exports of developing countries to all markets; called on developed countries that had not already done so, to work towards the objective of duty-free and quota-free access for all LDCs exports; called for additional bilateral and multilateral support and cooperation in areas of trade-related training, capacity-building, institution building, trade supporting services; and to commit Members to enhance the role of regional and subregional agreements and free-trade areas in consistency with the                                                                                    WT/COMTD/M/38                                                                                           Page 23 multilateral trading system. The other two sections of the Monterrey Consensus with particular relevance to the WTO were those that dealt with systemic issues and ""staying engaged"". In the section that dealt with systemic issues the text proposed that policy and programme coordination of international institutions and coherence at the national and international levels should be encouraged to meet the development goals of the Millennium Declaration. He said that the Secretariat felt that the mandate should be representative of the full membership and should be based on clear, simple and objective criteria so as to ensure the effectiveness of a global economic system which supported development. It should also identify areas where relationship between the UN and the WTO could be improved and where capacity to provide technical assistance could be strengthened. He went on to say that in the 'staying engaged' section, the text proposed that for the purposes of follow-up and coordination, the UN General Assembly and Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC) as well as intergovernmental and governing bodies of other institutional stakeholders would engage in preliminary consultations on the issues and address the issue of coherence, coordination and cooperation as a follow-up to the Conference at the spring meetings. It was proposed that the current high-level dialogue on strengthening international cooperation for development which was held every two years in General Assembly, would be reconstituted to include a policy dialogue with participation of 11 stakeholders under implementation of the results of the Conference. He said that copies of the final version of the agreed draft text of the Monterrey Consensus with UN document symbol A/AC.257/L.13 was available in all three working languages for the information of delegations.

He said that it would be divided into three segments. The first was the high-level official segment which was scheduled to be held during the morning of 18 March 2002, the second segment was the Ministerial segment which would take place from the afternoon of 18 March to 20 March 2002 and the third segment would be the summit component which was scheduled to be held from 21 to 22 March. As a stakeholder, the WTO involvement in the Conference would be at two levels, that of the membership and that of the Secretariat. He said that the Director-General had accepted the invitation to the Conference and would be making an introductory statement at the plenary session at the summit component of the Conference. The DG would also be co-sharing one of the summit level round tables on the theme ""Financing for Development: Looking Ahead"". The heads of the institutional stakeholders namely the IMF (Mr Köhler), the World Bank (Mr Wolfensohn), and the WTO (Mr Moore) along with the Secretary-General of the United Nations (Mr Kofi Annan) had also been invited to participate in the Press Conference sometime during the summit segment of the Conference.

While in 1995 exports of high-technology products accounted for no more than 1.2 per cent of all goods exported from the country, the relative share of the sector had risen to almost 30 per cent by the year 2000. From 1998 on, the arrival in Costa Rica of major foreign-owned firms led to an exponential increase in foreign sales in branches with a strong technological component. From 1995 to 2001, exports in the technology sector grew by an average of around 130 per cent per year.

"3914",3914,"10","10.      Deputy Director-General, Mr. Paul-Henri Ravier expressed his appreciation to Members for the opportunity to continue the dialogue on the Secretariat’s Technical Assistance Plan. The actual implementation of the Plan for 2002 had begun on 1 January 2002, and a little over 50 activities had been executed over the past two months. Operational activities were being implemented on the basis of the new strategy welcomed and endorsed by Ministers in paragraph 38 of the Doha Ministerial Declaration and on the basis of the clear mandate contained in the Doha Ministerial Declaration. Since implementation of the Plan began the Secretariat had been involved in exhaustive bilateral and plurilateral conversations with Members, both beneficiaries and providers of technical assistance. He assured Members that the Secretariat welcomed the advice that it was receiving. He said it was through the Members persistence that the necessary improvements had been made in the Plan. He emphasised that both the Plan and its implementation was work in progress. The Secretariat was still searching for the right approaches to respond to the new and unprecedented Development Agenda established at the Doha Ministerial Conference. It also meant that the Secretariat intended throughout the year and the implementation period, to meet the real needs of the beneficiaries and of the providers of the resources, in a flexible and dynamic manner. The Secretariat had continued                                                                                      WT/COMTD/M/39                                                                                              Page 3 consultations, in various formats, since the last CTD meeting in order to fine tune and focus the Plan more precisely around the substantive concerns that had been expressed by Members during the previous meetings. The results of the consultations were now embodied in the revised Plan.","WTCOMTDM39.pdf","Director-General, Paul-Henri, Ravier, Members, Secretariat, Secretariat, Members, Members, Secretariat, Members, Secretariat, Doha, Ministerial, Conference, Secretariat, Secretariat, Members"
"3915",3915,"11","11.      He then went on to comment on the content of the Plan and stated that the revision dealt not only with the list of activities, but also with the structure of the Plan itself. The Plan had now been structured around themes, issues and mandates. The annexes on the Singapore issues and on trade and environment had been removed and specific activities on those issues had been included in the main list of activities. More direct and visible links had been established between the WTO’s trade- related technical assistance and capacity-building activities and the Doha Development Agenda. The number of activities had also increased to 514, an increase that had enabled the Secretariat to accommodate the new, expanded and more elaborated needs of the Membership. In response to Members' emphasis on coordination with other agencies he reported that all the activities under investment and competition had been coordinated and would be jointly delivered by the WTO and UNCTAD. Active discussions were under way with other organizations and would be reported continuously to the Committee. As far as the least-developed countries (LDCs) were concerned a meeting of the Integrated Framework (IF) Heads of Agency that took place in Washington had made a significant contribution towards improving coherence and coordination amongst the six core IF agencies. The final communiqué adopted at that meeting of the Heads of Agency was available and would be reported on fully at a later meeting by the Director-General. The donors, LDCs and the African Group had already been briefed on the results of the meeting. He emphasized that not only had priority been accorded to the needs of the LDCs, but the WTO had also enhanced its efforts with other core agencies to significantly improve interagency coordination and coherence. He said that in the several informal consultations carried out by the Secretariat with various groups, beneficiary Members had expressed satisfaction with the revision recognizing that while the Plan might not be perfect, the Secretariat's assurances of flexibility in its implementation responded to their concerns.","WTCOMTDM39.pdf","Singapore, WTO, Doha, Development, Agenda, Secretariat, Members, WTO, UNCTAD, Committee, Washington, Director-General, LDCs, African, Group, WTO, Secretariat, Members, Secretariat"
"3916",3916,"12","12.      He went on to inform the Committee about the results of some activities undertaken by the Secretariat in relation to technical assistance and capacity-building. First, agencies and country providers of trade-related technical assistance had met in Geneva on 19 February 2002. The purpose of that meeting had been to explore the basis of coordinated action by agencies and country providers of technical assistance for the creation and management of a trade-related technical assistance database. The group agreed to meet periodically to begin the creation and the management of the database. The next meeting would be held on 12 March in the WTO. Since the first meeting of the group, the Heads of the six core IF agencies had endorsed the proposal for the database. Second, the meeting of the IF Heads of Agency which had been convened by the Director-General in Washington on 26 February 2002 and hosted by Mr Jim Wolfensohn, President of the World Bank, had been a success. The Heads of Agency meeting had focused inter alia on the implementation of the IF pilot scheme and its extension. A joint communiqué of the Heads of Agency had fully endorsed the extension of the IF to other least-developed countries. Third, the JITAP was a successful programme involving three agencies: ITC, UNCTAD and the WTO. It was an integral part of the 2002 Technical Assistance Plan and was currently under evaluation. Fourth, as a first step in the process of establishing strategic alliances with regional institutions, the Director-General and the President of the Inter-American Development Bank had signed, on 27 February 2002, a memorandum of understanding under which the institutions would seek to deepen cooperation in order to provide technical assistance on trade negotiations and capacity-building to countries in Latin America and the Caribbean. Fifth, he said that the Committee had a tight and substantive programme before the Pledging Conference. He appealed to donor countries and invited agencies to ensure that the Pledging Conference became a success. A success which would maintain the post-Doha momentum on the central issue of technical cooperation. He went on to say that the Annual Plan could not respond to all the needs of the beneficiary countries. The Plan was only one of six basic elements in the overall architecture for responding to the Doha mandate on technical cooperation. Those elements included the interagency strategic partnerships; strategic partnerships with the bilateral donors; strategic WT/COMTD/M/39 Page 4 partnerships with regional banks, regional institutions and commissions; the IF for responding to the needs and priorities of the LDCs, the WTO trade-related database and the Secretariat Annual Plan for responding to the short-term needs focused on WTO Agreements, building knowledge on the Agreements, explaining obligations, identifying the rights and enhancing trade negotiation and policy capacity. He said he hoped that it would be possible for the Committee to take note of the Revision 2 of the Technical Assistance Plan and allow the Secretariat to accelerate the pace of its implementation.","WTCOMTDM39.pdf","Committee, Secretariat, Geneva, WTO, IF, Heads, of, Agency, Director-General, Washington, Jim, Wolfensohn, World, Bank, Heads, of, Agency, ITC, UNCTAD, WTO, Director-General, Inter-American, Development, Bank, Latin, America, Caribbean, Committee, Doha, WTO, Secretariat, WTO, Committee, Secretariat"
"3917",3917,"13","13.      Deputy Director-General, Mr. Andrew Stoler said that once all the figures were consolidated the estimated costs for providing the planned technical assistance activities, including the related programme support funds, came to around CHF 22,5 million. Cost-sharing assumptions reduced that total by CHF 4.7 million, and when another CHF 1.5 million in costs to be borne by the regular budget of the WTO were deducted, the target for contributions to the Doha Development Agenda Global Trust Fund was around CHF 16.3 million. That figure was about CHF 1.3 million higher than the CHF 15 million target agreed to the General Council for the Doha Development Agenda Global Trust Fund for 2002. Since then further refinements had been made to the scope of the activities to be financed and the Secretariat had tried to refine the costing of the activities included in the Plan. The Annex previously attached to the Plan had been eliminated and additional technical cooperation projects had instead been incorporated in the Plan. Refining the approach to costing and changing certain assumptions with respect to cost-sharing arrangements had allowed the Secretariat to reduce the anticipated cost of the planned activities even, while expanding the scope of the work. That left a net amount of around CHF 15.8 million to be borne by the Doha Development Agenda Global Trust Fund on technical assistance activities which was about CHF 800,000 higher than the originally agreed target for the Doha Development Agenda Global Trust Fund. He said that arriving at those figures the Secretariat had used the same standard costing formula that he had referred to at the meeting.","WTCOMTDM39.pdf","Director-General, Andrew, Stoler, WTO, Doha, Development, Agenda, Global, Trust, Fund, General, Council, Doha, Development, Agenda, Global, Secretariat, Secretariat, Doha, Development, Agenda, Global, Trust, Fund, Doha, Development, Agenda, Global, Trust, Fund, Secretariat"
"3918",3918,"14","14.      He went on to say that there were various assumptions made on the basis of past experience with respect to potential cost-sharing arrangements. Those cost-sharing arrangement assumptions differed according to partners and according to activities. In most cases, the Secretariat had been conservative in their estimate of cost sharing. However, it was true that in some cases they had not been able to determine the final capacity of their partners to deliver on the expected cost-sharing arrangements. That would be important, for example, in the case of joint activities planned with UNCTAD with respect to investment and competition where UNCTAD had been expected to share in the programme costs on the basis of fifty-fifty participation. All the figures he had given therefore assumed that on those important projects there would be a fifty-fifty cost-sharing participation. He said that if that assumption turned out to be incorrect it would affect the overall costing from the WTO standpoint. He concluded by saying that he believed that now Members had before them fairly reliable figures that should give them confidence that WTO would be able to accomplish the planned activities within the forecasted levels of funding and he hoped that these details would help them be better prepared for the Pledging Conference.","WTCOMTDM39.pdf","Secretariat, UNCTAD, UNCTAD, WTO, Members, WTO"
"3919",3919,"15","15.      The Chairman said that it was his understanding that the Secretariat had held several consultations with groups of the Membership as well as with individual Members. Based on the reports it appeared that the Secretariat had been able to accommodate the core concerns of Members in the Revised Plan. He proposed that the Committee take note of the Plan.","WTCOMTDM39.pdf","Chairman, Secretariat, Members, Secretariat, Members, Committee"
"3920",3920,"16","16.     The representative of Ghana sought clarification so that he could inform his Government about what to expect. His delegation had requested technical assistance in respect of the TRIPS Agreement and Competition Law and Policy and trade negotiating skills. It had received a response from the Secretariat indicating that the needs would be accommodated in the Plan, but now he saw the regional agreements against the name of his country on page 23 of the Plan. He asked whether it was under the indicated regional activity that his delegation's request would be accommodated. He also                                                                                     WT/COMTD/M/39                                                                                             Page 5 asked whether on the WTO Agreements his country would be expected to indicate the specific activities that they wished to be carried out under the regional agreements.","WTCOMTDM39.pdf","Ghana, Secretariat, WTO"
"3921",3921,"17","17.     The representative of Egypt said that he was pleased that the Plan was considered as work in progress because some fine tuning had to be done in the future. In respect to that, he said that his delegation wished to reinforce and reiterate the idea that JITAP should be part of the Plan as expressly mentioned in paragraph 39 of the Doha Ministerial Declaration. He said that the JITAP had been a successful programme that had benefited many developing countries and further coherence with that programme would be useful. As a number of activities under the Plan still were to be confirmed, he expressed his delegation's interest in hosting one of the activities in the competition policy area mentioned on page 15 of the Plan. The intensive training course mentioned at the top of the page would be a useful addition to their programme. He commented on Deputy Director-General Stoler's concern as to the possibility, however remote, that other parties to the programme might not contribute the expected financial resources on time, and asked whether the Secretariat could in any way ensure that this eventuality did not become a reality.","WTCOMTDM39.pdf","Egypt, Director-General, Stoler, Secretariat"

The representative of the European Communities began by reminding the Committee of how, at the last meeting, his delegation had been critical of the Plan and had expressed difficulty endorsing it. However, he was pleased that an fair amount of work had been devoted into the restructuring of the document and many of their points had been taken into account. He however said that they would continue to look for issues that they thought were not fully addressed, for instance, the focus on Africa and the focus on LDCs could be strengthened, the financing could be made clearer and the focus on negotiating could also be clearer. It was also important to point out the revised paragraph 2(i) where Members had a clear commitment to work further on the strategic partnerships. Much of the work in that connection was work in progress, but the large amount of activities which was now included, in particular with UNCTAD on investment and competition policy showed that it went in the right direction. He also hoped to see progress on trade facilitation. He said that the his delegation was pleased with paragraph 5 where it was made clear that any activity undertaken had to answer the basic question as how it was related to the Doha Ministerial Mandate. Those who executed the planned workshops would have to look for specific requests related to Doha Commitments and that the work in progress also meant that those activities would need to be structured differently from what they had been in the past.","WTCOMTDM39.pdf","Committee, Africa, Members, UNCTAD"
"3923",3923,"19","19.     He went on to say that his delegation was willing to endorse the work on the basis of what was in the Plan. However, he urged the Secretariat to start consultations with Members early for 2003 in order to have a smoother debate then. It was important to better identify needs and to have a better approach to cooperation with other organizations. He acknowledged that there had been a shortage of time for such an approach in 2002. However, Members still needed a solid basis to continue their work. He concluded by saying that, in terms of costing, he was pleased that more work was being proposed to be done in the Plan with less money.","WTCOMTDM39.pdf","Secretariat, Members, Members"

There should be more coordination in the delivery of technical assistance among all international organizations. The layout of the document was helpful because it focussed on specific countries and areas. Another merit of the document was that it was demand driven which meant that possible donors could be assured of the needs of developing countries. She was pleased that the Plan was work in progress and asked how a Member should go about submitting or resubmitting requests. Her delegation had some previous requests which could not be implemented due to budgetary constraints. Those requests were not reflected in the revised Plan. Accordingly, she called the attention of the Secretariat to the previously requested technical assistance. Her delegation also indicated its interest in hosting a regional seminar on Trade and Competition Policy. WT/COMTD/M/39 Page 6","WTCOMTDM39.pdf","Philippines, Member, Secretariat"

The representative of Kenya noted that Members had perhaps not yet fully absorbed the realities of what was specifically needed for the implementation of the Doha Development Agenda. He was pleased that the Secretariat had noted that. The Plan was work in progress and his delegation noted that its execution would be combined with flexibility and that its implementation would give Members the possibility to prioritise what they wished. That was where timing became crucial. His Government was considering the Plan and what activities had been allocated to it. His Government would rather start with the activity on page 52, a seminar on trade policy, capacity-building and research, as that was their priority and one that tied well with the Doha Development Agenda. He hoped a date for the that activity would be communicated soon. He went on to say that being a beneficiary of the JITAP had been a success story for his country as its benefits had been clearly visible. He agreed that it should command the same priority, if not more than the IF. He said that the Secretariat Plan gave prominence to the IF which he understood to still be in the pilot stage. However, the JITAP had been a success and it should be continued. It was mentioned in the Doha Ministerial Declaration and it would therefore be appropriate if it could also figure in the Plan so as to make it more balanced. He welcomed the proposed increase in the number of activities. However, the timing and the level of the technical assistance would also be very important. His Government wished to receive this capacity-building and technical assistance before the commencement of the negotiations on the subjects mentioned in the Doha Ministerial Declaration.","WTCOMTDM39.pdf","Kenya, Members, Doha, Development, Agenda, Secretariat, Members, Doha, Development, Agenda, Secretariat"

The representative of Belize said that although Deputy Director-General Ravier had indicated that the Plan might not be perfect it did not mean that the implementation could not be near perfect. He was confident that the Secretariat would do its best to ensure that the objectives were met. The sense of the Secretariat being overwhelmed derived from what had now become an expanded programme. That would give insight into the challenges faced by small economies and missions in Geneva. His delegation welcomed the establishment of strategic partnerships and/or strengthening of any previously existing ones and said he hoped that this would facilitate the creation of more direct links between technical assistance and capacity-building programmes as part of the Doha Development Agenda. Such partnerships should not be short term, but should become sustainable as the needs for technical assistance and capacity-building would always remain. The Secretariat Plan had facilitated structuring and restructuring of the national plans for technical assistance and capacity- building as it had allowed delegations to match any programme offers with their identified needs. He asked if any assurances had been made from any of the intended cost-sharing partners and to what extent the Plan had adopted the successes from earlier technical assistance Plans delivered by the Secretariat. In particular, he mentioned the IF, as he was aware that it had been a success and that there had been some changes in it, that might be good to take note of or even incorporate in the Plan. He concluded by asking whether any indication or pledges for funding for subsequent years had been secured and whether such discussions were part of the ongoing negotiations or if the approach of the Secretariat was to pursue them on a year-to-year basis rather than over a longer period.","WTCOMTDM39.pdf","Belize, Director-General, Ravier, Secretariat, Secretariat, Geneva, Doha, Development, Agenda, Secretariat, Secretariat, Secretariat"
"3928",3928,"23","23.      The representative of Uganda said that he was speaking on behalf of the LDCs. He stressed that the LDCs Ministers had been apprehensive when the Doha Agenda had been expanded as the LDCs lacked capacity. The Doha Agenda was going to stretch their capacities to the maximum. The situation was likely to become particularly complex in the near future, hence the need for prioritised capacity-building for the LDCs, which had been stressed in the introduction to the Plan. He agreed with the representative of the European Communities that such a priority should also have been well reflected in the operation of the activities. The LDCs did not believe that their priority was adequately reflected, but noted that the Plan was work in progress. With regard to paragraph 7, he was unsure how the Secretariat would accommodate additional requests when revisions were said to be tightly controlled and flexible at the same time. Some of the needs of the Members were being assumed and there had to be a mechanism for addressing those needs. With regard to the LDC needs being mostly dealt within the context of the IF, he said that looking at the activities for the LDCs, there were mostly for the pilot countries. It was therefore not clear how issues specific to LDCs not part of the pilot countries would be dealt with outside the IF. That was an issue had to be drawn to the                                                                                    WT/COMTD/M/39                                                                                            Page 7 attention of the Secretariat and he hoped that, in the costing of the programme, imaginative solutions could be found. He agreed with the representative of Kenya and Egypt with regard to JITAP. The LDCs, as consumers of technical assistance, had benefited from JITAP. In Uganda, the public sector, private sector and civil society had all found it to be one of the most effective mechanisms of building capacity. He urged that its extension be agreed and that it be included in the Plan. He said the LDCs welcomed the efforts to create synergies with the other agencies such as WIPO, FAO and UNCTAD. However, there had to be more emphasis on market access. There was an imbalance with the focus being on only some of the issues. Technical assistance and capacity building was part and parcel of the Doha Work Programme and affected other parts of the programme as well.","WTCOMTDM39.pdf","Uganda, LDCs, Doha, Agenda, LDCs, LDCs, Secretariat, Members, LDC, Secretariat, Kenya, Egypt, JITAP, Uganda, LDCs, WIPO, FAO, UNCTAD, Doha, Work, Programme"

He went on to say that his delegation wished the Plan established clear objectives with targets to be achieved that would form the basis upon which the envisaged evaluation and auditing could take place. In doing so it should be taken into account whether the short seminars were effective in the building of capacity and of any other goals set. He emphasized that the Doha Ministerial Declaration recognized LDCs as the group of countries with the most acute technical assistance and capacity- building needs. That should be reflected in the operative part of the Plan through the balancing of issues covered and through balanced geographical distribution. The Plan was being administered separately under a fund and presently only covered three out of the forty-nine LDCs. He took note of the joint statement by the Heads of Agencies for the meeting in Washington and though it was supposed to deal with the IF, it had dealt with a wider field and there had even been consideration of extending the IF. The IF had to first be effective and extended to all the LDCs. Its extension should not have negative consequences on the LDCs. He concluded by saying that his delegation was willing to take note of the Plan and hoped that it would be revised according to the comments made. He noted that there was only one activity specifically for Uganda by WIPO.","WTCOMTDM39.pdf","Heads, of, Agencies, Washington, Uganda, WIPO"

The representative of Venezuela said that her delegation had always understood that the Plan was not to be adopted, but rather that Members would make comments which would bring the Plan up to the level of its objectives which was primarily the strengthening of the national capacity of the countries involved. She agreed with other delegations that the implementation of the Plan could be improved upon and that it should be done. In order to improve it, the activities had to be determined in close coordination with the recipient countries. Experiences should be taken into consideration in order to optimise the programmes so as to ensure the appropriate follow-up. She gave the example of a regional seminar on environment held in Latin America, the organization of which she said had been far from ideal. The travel tickets had been made available to participants only about a day before their proposed departure. The seminar had been convened rather hastily, and her Government had very little time to nominate the participants. It was essential that there should be better coordination between the recipients, the donors and the WTO including on when that type of technical cooperation was being provided. She hoped that such difficulties would be overcome in the future and that the experience would be used to improve future activities. With regard to the capacity-building programme she said that her delegation continued to believe that coordination with UNCTAD could be strengthened. She expressed her gratitude on the information provided on the budgetary aspect and the funding for the implementation of the Plan and said that some delegations felt that the idea was not to do more with less, but that the philosophy should be to do more and better, with more.","WTCOMTDM39.pdf","Venezuela, Members, Latin, America, WTO, UNCTAD"
"3931",3931,"26","26.     The representative of Senegal said that his delegation subscribed to everything that has been said by the representative of Uganda on behalf of the LDCs. His country believed that the main points of the activities that his delegation had requested for had been reflected in the Plan. His delegation saw that there was considerable improvement in the revision of the Plan with regards the ease of reading the document, on the approach according to the different topics included and also by including to the different principles underlying the document. For instance, the flexibility highlighted in paragraph 7, was a highly important aspect which would certainly be required. The activities which had been reflected in the document stemmed from the technical assistance programme which had been elaborated in 2001 and with time there may be certain activities that may have to be WT/COMTD/M/39 Page 8 modified or even amended and other activities included. There were many elements in the document which his delegation welcomed, for example the creation of a database which would be another step towards a greater coherence in technical assistance activities. He asked for information on that idea and said that the developing countries should be helped in ensuring access to the database, once the operational stage of the database was reached. With regard to the costing of the Plan, he said that his delegations concerns were justified since it saw that the estimates had gone beyond the CHF 15 million target that set. He hoped that that would be taken into consideration at the Pledging Conference. The Doha Development Agenda, which was in addition to the normal activities of the WTO, would quite naturally require a lot of funds. Members would be needing the support of the Development and Economic Research Division for studies to be carried out in specific areas so that Members had the necessary information to enable them to negotiate correctly. He concluded by asking to what degree the patent for technical assistance which had been established under such areas as customs valuation, technical barriers to trade had been taken into consideration in the overall programme.","WTCOMTDM39.pdf","Senegal, Uganda, LDCs, Doha, Development, Agenda, WTO, Members, Development, and, Economic, Research, Division, Members"

The representative of Canada said that her delegation was pleased to note that the Plan was work in progress and looked forward to the inclusion of the JITAP programme as an important instrument of the technical assistance and capacity building as had been noted by other delegations. As the present donor coordinator for the JITAP programme, she said her delegation was pleased to announce that the donors would be favourably disposed to using some of the funding to create toolkits which would be of great use to the beneficiaries. That process had already began under the JITAP programme. Her delegation noted that the evaluation which was presently under way was going to look at the lessons learned and best practices of the programme as a point of assistance to other countries. She hoped that the IF, to which her Government was a major donor, would use the diagnostic tools that had been used by the World Bank and others in the process. That would speed up the process of allowing beneficiaries to make full use of all the mechanisms which had been recently made available. In that regard, her delegation supported the EC statement that, by working together throughout the year, the process of considering the technical assistance Plan would be strengthened for 2003. She highlighted paragraph 11 which dealt with monitoring and review, saying that that would help Members learn from what had been done and what could be done to ensure that the best instruments were used, so as to ensure the best use of the resources available for the Plan.","WTCOMTDM39.pdf","Canada, World, Bank, EC, Members"

His delegation was aware that the document was not perfect and in that respect appreciated that the Secretariat had confirmed that the document was work in progress. His delegation was prepared to contribute in that regard. He said his Government sought the possibility of hosting seminars in Geneva with the cooperation of WTO in the field of the Singapore issues. He said that though the document was important, the implementation of it was even more so.

The representative of Mauritania said that the importance attached to technical assistance had to be enhanced as it was an instrument to enable the developing countries, and LDCs in particular, to better integrate to in the multilateral trading system. He welcomed the efforts made over the last few years and which had made it possible for his Government to benefit from technical assistance and to make progress. His delegation believed that the interdependence between the Plan and the IF had not been sufficiently highlighted. During the diagnostic studies which had been undertaken in pilot countries, his being one of them, precise needs had been flagged, in terms of technical assistance and those were reflected in the matrix. He believed that it would be useful to see to what degree the technical assistance requirements reflected in the matrix could be better taken into consideration in the actual programme. He said that it might be difficult to take them all into consideration, but as far as his country was concerned, they believed that the strengthening of trade negotiating capacities in the area of services and agriculture and the establishment of new schedules of concessions and for example the implementation of notification requirements were all areas which should be taken into consideration in the programme. As had already been said in the Heads of Agencies Communiqué, his delegation believed that the time had come to consider a different approach to draw up projects which could be presented to donors. His Government was in fact preparing a project which would be submitted to the Standing Committee of the IF at its meeting on 8 March 2002. Those projects took into consideration the priority requirements which had been identified in the course of the diagnostic service that would be available and distributed to all partners that showed an interest in the area.","WTCOMTDM39.pdf","Mauritania, LDCs, Standing, Committee"

"3939",3939,"33","33.      The representative of Argentina said that, in connection with the revision of the Plan, he had some questions for the Secretariat. First, as there had been certain changes, he asked if there had been elimination of, or modification to some of the activities proposed in the earlier versions, particularly of those in Latin American countries. Second, he asked if there was, as a result of carrying out more activities with less resources, had been any qualitative modification in activities, especially with respect to the regional seminars and if there had been a reduction in the logistic backup in terms of the number of invited participants to regional seminars. Turning to general comments on technical assistance, he said that on evaluation of the implementation of the Plan would be important. It might therefore be worthwhile, as the end of the first quarter of the year was approaching, to have the Secretariat draw up an evaluation of already-implemented activities. Such a factual evaluation would permit delegations to identify any problems that might have occurred, with a view to improving the situation. He said that he did not have any further information regarding the trade and environment seminar for the Latin American region which should have been held in Colombia and which had been mentioned by the representative of Venezuela. If it had not been productive and had not yield the desired results, there would unfortunately still not be any other seminar throughout the year. There were two other activities in the field of trade and environment, but they related to specific environment protocols. The seminar to which he had referred to was one on trade and environment in general, covering a wide range of subjects in the field. Lastly, with respect to implementation, he suggested that the document which presented the activities on an item-by-item or subject-by-subject basis should at the end, have a list of activities by date, including the subject, for delegations to get a clear picture and an overview of how the implementation had advanced.

Her delegation supported continuing work on developing partnerships with other institutions that could participate in the programmes outlined and any other programmes that would evolve. She reiterated the suggestion that her delegation had made in the last CTD meeting, that the CTD Chairman should consult with the Chairpersons of other WTO bodies with technical assistance mandates, to enable the CTD to take-stock of what was going on in the other bodies with respect to technical assistance.","WTCOMTDM39.pdf","United, States, Committee, Members, Argentina, CTD, Chairman, WTO, CTD"

His delegation was pleased to find that the document had taken into account concerns his delegation had raised. His Government was experiencing a difficult period and its priorities might fluctuate.

There might even be fluctuations in delegations' priorities for technical cooperation activities and that should be allowed within the limit of the Secretariat's resources. However, his delegation did not believe that it was a good idea for the Committee to continue to debate the Plan. Its implementation had to start and additional improvements could be made during its implementation. His delegation also had some editorial issues which he would raise with the Secretariat later. Other delegations could also do the same so that the discussions could now stop and the implementation commence.

The Plan was possibly the one WTO document which had been the object of the greatest amount of consultations with a view to taking Members' concerns into account. That transparency was reflected in the Plan. The document was not only discussed in the CTD, its financing had been pushed in the Committee on Budget, Finance and Administration. His delegation appreciated the importance attached to its evaluation. A unit had been established to carry out the evaluation and assist the Committee in that respect. That would guarantee those concerned that all activities would be implemented. Members should trust that the proposed audit would evaluate and conceivably fine-tune the Plan, that should now be adopted in order for its implementation to begin, even though it could be subject to further improvement during its implementation. He said that it should be implemented with both rigour and flexibility. Deputy Director-General Stoler had indirectly invited delegations to take the financing dimension into account. The Pledging Conference would present an opportunity for his Governments' development partners, who had been most generous, to realize that the CHF 15 million requested earlier would perhaps not suffice and that additional funds may be required. The Plan was quite balanced and should be adopted for its implementation to proceed, an implementation which was really ongoing as two missions had already been undertaken to Haiti.","WTCOMTDM39.pdf","Haiti, WTO, Members, CTD, Committee, on, Budget, ,, Finance, and, Administration, Committee, Members, Director-General, Stoler, Haiti"
"3948",3948,"41","41.      The representative of Morocco said that the revised Plan was clearer, particularly since the technical assistance aspect had been greatly strengthened since the Doha Ministerial Conference. The technical cooperation activities were an important aspect of WTO’s work, particularly to help the developing countries and LDCs better understand the mechanisms and rules of the Organization and thus enable them to apply them appropriately. The technical assistance already provided, although fairly satisfactory, was nonetheless insufficient since the technical assistance needs of the developing and LDCs countries had increased as a result of the multiplicity of new areas now being covered by the WTO. The creation of new working groups provided an example of that new growth. His delegation therefore believed that any annual technical assistance programme should be somewhat flexibile in order to accommodate those new aspects. His delegation attached importance to the implementation which should be considerably strengthened, particularly in the area of negotiating techniques. His Government was pleased to be the host of an upcoming regional seminar for French- speaking African countries which was being organized to enable developing countries to take important decisions after the Fifth Ministerial Conference. The role played by UNCTAD was essential since that Organization had an undeniable comparative advantage on the Singapore issues which would be dealt with during the seminar. The work in the WTO included new issues such as environment, electronic commerce and different technology-related issues. New ground had to be broken as the WTO technical assistance programme could no longer be limited to the classic organization of seminars and workshops. Certain criteria, such as for example the multiplying effect of training activities should be strengthened. His delegation therefore reiterated, in a purely explorative manner, a suggestion for organizing with the Moroccan University, a whole round of new studies which could have benefit many countries in the African region. Such an activity would be in line with the training activities undertaken by WTO and would be beneficial, since those receiving a diploma as a result of such studies would be able to handle WTO issues both in the Government as well as in the private sector.","WTCOMTDM39.pdf","Morocco, Doha, Ministerial, Conference, WTO, LDCs, WTO, UNCTAD, Singapore, WTO, WTO, Moroccan, University, WTO, WTO"
"3949",3949,"42","42.     The representative of Switzerland said that the new draft was an improvement over the old version. His delegation was particularly appreciative of the synthesis and more compact presentation, achieved by subdividing the activities according to topics. Evaluation or assessment should not only be carried out at the end of the year in the form of the report which was to be made to the General Council under the heading of Capacity-Building. He welcomed the statements made by the representatives of Venezuela and Argentina who had suggested that evaluation should be carried out WT/COMTD/M/39 Page 12 as the Plan was implemented. It was important to improve the Plan as it was implemented to refine activities when either gaps or deficiencies were noticed. That would ensure the most efficient use of the resources available. Evaluation also implied transparency and his delegation wished to stress that transparency, which was currently apparent when reading the Plan, be also ensured with regard to future requests from Governments, including feedback from those Governments which had already benefited from certain programme activities. That would give delegations a clearer picture of what was being requested and how those requests would be followed up in the course of the year. He called for the inclusion of an item involving the JITAP. The JITAP was a pioneer exercise in the overall framework of coordination, in this case between three organizations active in the area of technical assistance. Even though it was not clear what the follow-up would be, positive lessons could already be drawn. His delegation welcomed the increased effort of coordinating technical assistance activities since the Doha Ministerial Conference, with other organizations like UNCTAD, including the emphasis sought to be given to investment. That coordination should also be attempted in other areas where UNCTAD had an announced programme of activities, such as in the area of trade facilitation for example and electronic commerce.","WTCOMTDM39.pdf","Switzerland, General, Council, Venezuela, Argentina, UNCTAD, UNCTAD"
"3950",3950,"43","43.      The representative of Nigeria requested the Secretariat to take account of the relevant comments that had been made, especially on the need for flexibility, close coordination with beneficiaries and evaluation. However, what was most important was the effectiveness of the technical assistance provided and the resulting improvement in the situation of the beneficiaries. He also said that his delegation was ready to adopt the Plan.","WTCOMTDM39.pdf","Nigeria, Secretariat"
"3951",3951,"44","44.     The representative of China sought a clarification on the status of the Plan since many delegations had said that they were ready to adopt the Plan. He asked whether the Plan would be adopted or just taken note of. His understanding was that the Committee should take note of it, since its adoption could create problems for some delegations and set a precedent for the future, which was not desirable.","WTCOMTDM39.pdf","China, Committee"
"3952",3952,"45","45.      The Chairman clarified that the intention was to only take note of the Plan. He said that Deputy Director-General Ravier had said in the beginning that it was an ongoing process. However, if the Plan was adopted, it would be difficult to incorporate changes in it. The intention was therefore to take note of the Plan and to work on it as its implementation proceeded.","WTCOMTDM39.pdf","Chairman, Director-General, Ravier"
"3953",3953,"46","46.     The representative of the European Communities said that the Committee should endorse the Plan. Even though, concerns had been raised that this would mean the Committee was being forced to have an unflexible Plan, there was an easy way out, and that was to ask the Secretariat to start implementing the Plan. Many delegations had accepted that the Plan was flexible and that the Committee would not be bound to every letter of it. It was clear that it was work in progress, and that the Committee should accept and advise the Secretariat to implement it on such an understanding. That was would be enough of an endorsement. Just taking note would also set a precedent which his delegation would not be able to accept.","WTCOMTDM39.pdf","European, Communities, Committee, Committee, Secretariat, Committee, Committee, Secretariat"
"3954",3954,"47","47.      Mr Osakwe, Director, Technical Cooperation Division said that he welcomed and deeply encouraged the comments, criticisms and questions to the Secretariat which would all help in further improving the perfection of the Plan. The implementation of the Plan would also be guided by the comments, questions, clarifications and the suggestions that had been made. The Plan was currently undergoing evaluation and the Secretariat would be reporting to CTD, at an appropriate moment, on the results of the evaluation which had been undertaken by independent evaluators. He confirmed that the JITAP was an important and successful programme on which a report would follow. He said that there were several requests for clarification regarding the last sentence of paragraph 7 of the document WT/COMTD/W/95/Rev.2. That sentence referred to ad hoc requests and the need to keep them to a minimum. There was no inconsistency between ad hoc requests and flexibility. That last sentence should therefore be read in the context of the overall setting of paragraph 7. The purpose of                                                                                    WT/COMTD/M/39                                                                                           Page 13 paragraph 7 was to state that there would be both flexibility and dynamism in the Plan. The last sentence referred to that. He said that within the overall context of flexibly in the implementation of the Plan, and accommodating the needs of the beneficiaries, there would minimal disposition to requests of an ad hoc nature. This was not intended requests that involved either the submission of new or resubmission of technical assistance needs. Ad hoc requests were strictly defined as those activities that were submitted on the spur of the moment and which at times gave rise to conflicts between the authorities in the capitals and their Geneva based missions. This created innumerable challenges and problems for the Secretariat. He said that the Plan would be implemented in a flexible manner. He recalled that CARICOM had been quoted as an example at the last meeting. They had already submitted new requests on the basis of which the Secretariat had substituted some of the old activities by new ones in the current Plan. Such changes were possible and did not fall into the category of ad hoc requests. The importance of evaluation during the course of the implementation of the Plan had been mentioned. He said that this was a good point as it would ensure that evaluation was not back loaded at the end of the year. An independent technical cooperation audit had been established within the Secretariat, but independent of the Technical Cooperation Division and all other divisions. There had been some specific questions regarding the details of the Plan. Based on the suggestion from the Chairman, he proposed to take up these individually with the concerned delegations. There had been several requests by delegations to host regional activities in the areas where it had been indicated that the venue was ""to be confirmed"". Such requests were welcome and would be put to all the countries in the regions concerned. The determination of venues for regional activities was not a determination that the WTO Secretariat could make on its own. This selection was based on consultations with countries in the regions and with the regional organizations involved.","WTCOMTDM39.pdf","Osakwe, Director, Technical, Cooperation, Division, Secretariat, Secretariat, CTD, Geneva, Secretariat, CARICOM, Secretariat, Secretariat, Technical, Cooperation, Division, Chairman, WTO, Secretariat"
"3955",3955,"48","48.      He continued by welcoming the offer made by the delegation of the United States and the similar offer made by the representative of Japan, to host technical assistance activities in Geneva for which they would request support from the WTO Secretariat. He confirmed that the Secretariat would be in a position to support Members who wished to host technical assistance activities complementary to the Plan. He then referred to the requests made for more information on the proposed technical assistance database. A database would be created and managed by the WTO, but with assistance by both agency and country providers of technical assistance. The idea of creating a database had also received strong support from all the agencies at the level of Heads of Agency at the last IF meeting. That could be seen in paragraph 10 of the Final Communiqué of the Integrated Framework of Heads of Agency Meeting. The database would contain a listing of all beneficiaries, a list of the agencies as well as country providers of trade-related technical assistance. The agencies and country providers would feed details of their activities into the data-base, on the basis of agreed trade-related technical assistance categories. It would increase coherence and improve coordination, minimize duplication and hopefully lead to a more even distribution of the delivery of technical assistance to countries. He said that the LDCs continued to be the priority focus of WTO technical assistance as were the small economies and the non-residents. The Plan should, in that respect, be read in conjunction with a communiqué that had been circulated as part of the documentation for the meeting. In addition, the LDCs would benefit from national activities in their countries as well as from training activities in the WTO; from the Trade-Policy Reviews; and from regional seminars.","WTCOMTDM39.pdf","United, States, Japan, Geneva, WTO, Secretariat, Secretariat, Members, WTO, Heads, of, Agency, Integrated, Framework, of, Heads, of, Agency, Meeting, LDCs, WTO, LDCs, WTO"
"3956",3956,"49","49.     Deputy-Director General, Mr. Andrew Stoler said that a copy of the remarks he had made today was available in the room. There had been a question about whether or not the refinement of costs had affected the quality of the programmes. He did not believe it had. What had happened since the 14th of February was that there had been a downward revision of certain costs by about CHF 200,000 and an upward revision in cost-sharing of about CHF 225,000 francs. The cost-sharing arrangements had ensured savings to particular types of technical cooperation, for example in the rules area. Keeping that in mind and considering the question raised of what would happen if the cost-sharing arrangements did not come through, he said that first, the assumptions made with respect to cost-sharing were based on WTO's past experience with these agencies. Second, it had to be remembered that, in addition to the funds raised through the Pledging Conference, the Doha WT/COMTD/M/39 Page 14 Development Agenda Global Trust Fund also had an associated one million franc Buffer Fund designed to cover any temporary shortfalls that might occur, including because of some of the cost- sharing arrangements not working out as quickly as expected. Thirdly, while the General Council had set the overall level of the Doha Development Global Trust Fund for 2002 at CHF 15 million and although he had said that the estimate of the amount the Secretariat wished to receive was CHF 15.8 million, it was certainly hoped that donors would exceed that level of funding when they came to the Pledging Conference. However, no particular problems were expected in the area of cost-sharing. Finally, it had been asked whether or not there were any provisions for multiyear funding. The Doha Development Agenda Global Trust Fund was an annual fund. Targets were determined annually and it was to be operated annually. However, nothing in the rules of the fund prevented Members from making multiyear contributions.","WTCOMTDM39.pdf","Andrew, Stoler, WTO, Doha, Development, Agenda, Global, Trust, Fund, General, Council, Secretariat, Doha, Development, Agenda, Global, Trust, Fund, Members"

"3978",3978,"10","10.      He then pointed out that structural weaknesses in economies prevented LLDCs from taking advantage, in the short- and medium-term, of the opportunities to attract investment and expand exports. Among the grave problems facing LLDCs was the huge debt problem. In 1993, the external debt of African LLDCs stood at $96.7 billion and the ratio of total debt to GNP was 130 per cent. In nominal terms, the ratio of total debt to export of goods and services worsened from 389 per cent in 1985 to 565 per cent in 1993. The debt burden constrained the ability of LLDCs to invest in newer technologies to increase the production of goods and services for export. Instead of using their export earnings to strengthen supply capacities, earnings went into servicing their debts, perpetuating the cycle of poverty. Effective action at the multilateral level along the lines proposed by the World Bank to ease the debt burden on African and other poorer countries was needed; otherwise, African countries could not participate effectively in the multilateral trading system. A collective effort by the WTO, the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the World Bank and other intergovernmental economic institutions such as the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) and the International Trade Centre (ITC) would yield results. The Bretton Woods Institutions could be encouraged to significantly reduce the debt burden of African and other poorer countries, and to offer loans on concessional terms. Such measures would help LLDCs to adjust quickly to the short-term negative effects of the Uruguay Round, re-structure their economies, increase their exports and participate effectively in the multilateral trading system. Uruguay Round tariff cuts on products of export interest to LLDCs were below the global averages, and there was need for serious efforts by the international trading community to eliminate the barriers facing LLDC trade. He went on to enumerate measures that could be taken by the international trading community and by the WTO, UNCTAD and ITC to increase the trading opportunities of LLDCs. Product coverage and margins of preferences under GSP schemes should be improved. Preferences should be extended to semi-processed and processed agricultural products, natural resource-based products, fish and fish products, leather and footwear, textile and clothing. He encouraged countries who did not give preferential treatment to extend such treatment to the exports of LLDCs. The assistance of the WTO and other intergovernmental institutions was needed to develop and strengthen nascent service industries, especially in the increasingly important areas of financial services, transport and telecommunications. He asked that LLDC exports be exempted from any contingent protection measures, such as anti-dumping duties, countervailing duties and safeguard measures; and that major trading partners refrain from using measures such as environmental and labour regulations to restrict LLDC exports. Integrating LLDCs into the global economy called for painstaking sacrifices from them, and for ingenuity and foresight from trading partners and intergovernmental institutions such as the WTO, IMF, the World Bank, UNCTAD, ITC and FAO. Policy reforms undertaken by almost every least-developed country were clear evidence of their commitment to an open multilateral trading system.","WTCOMTDM4.pdf","LLDCs, LLDCs, World, Bank, WTO, International, Monetary, Fund, IMF, World, Bank, United, Nations, Conference, on, Trade, and, Development, UNCTAD, International, Trade, Centre, ITC, Uruguay, Round, Uruguay, Round, LLDCs, WTO, UNCTAD, ITC, LLDCs, GSP, WTO, WTO, IMF, World, Bank, UNCTAD, ITC, FAO"

A great deal of technical work on the subject had been carried out and the time had come to try and spell out certain ideas specifically. He said the Secretariat could assist by redistributing an informal paper submitted during the Uruguay Round by a number of Members, including Mexico, Egypt and Morocco. The Secretariat could also prepare WT/COMTD/M/4 Page 4 for the next meeting of the CTD a detailed document setting out the dimensions of the subject, and outlining options open to Members.","WTCOMTDM4.pdf","Morocco, Mexico, CTD, Secretariat, Uruguay, Members, Mexico, Egypt, Morocco, Secretariat, CTD, Members"

The representative of India said that credit should be given for autonomous liberalization measures, and that binding of such measures in the WTO should not be a pre-requisite. If a country did bind its measures in the WTO, the legitimacy of its claim to be granted credit could not be questioned. While his delegation fully supported the concept, he was not in a position at this stage to suggest any mechanism for implementing it. He noted that paragraph 13 of the background document listed certain problems which could not be resolved at earlier meetings of the CTD. As no consensus was in sight, he agreed with Members that the issue should remain on the agenda of the CTD. He highlighted that the importance of the issue had also been recognized in the General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS).","WTCOMTDM4.pdf","India, WTO, WTO, CTD, Members, CTD, General, Agreement, on, Trade, in, Services"
"3981",3981,"13","13.      Recalling that his delegation was one of the co-sponsors of the proposal made by Mexico in 1990, the representative of Peru said it was important for his delegation that the issue remained on the agenda of the CTD until a satisfactory solution was found. His delegation supported the request made by Morocco that a detailed informal paper be prepared by the Secretariat and thought such a paper should be comprehensive and elaborate on the ideas proposed in paragraphs 13 and 17 of the background document. The representative of Cote d'Ivoire recalled the strong support given by her delegation during the Uruguay Round to the concept of credit and recognition. For her delegation, the issue had additional importance because it would concretize the concept of coherence between the WTO and the Bretton Woods Institutions. The argument that credit could be given only for bound measures, ignored the benefits to trading partners from such measures. Granting credit for such measures would not only be equitable, but would also underline the seriousness of developed countries about the need to integrate the economies of developing countries into the global economy and encourage developing countries to adopt liberal trading policies, thus complementing and strengthening the multilateral trading system. She said this was an important issue and should be maintained on the future agenda of the CTD.","WTCOMTDM4.pdf","Mexico, Peru, CTD, Morocco, Secretariat, Uruguay, WTO, CTD"
"3982",3982,"14","14.      Expressing his appreciation for the background document prepared by the Secretariat the representative of the European Communities recalled that at the Second Session, they had outlined albeit in a preliminary manner, their views on the issue of credit and recognition. They were of the view that liberalization measures had been taken into account in the Uruguay Round, and were reflected in the overall results of the negotiations on market access. He thought some of the views expressed in the background document were untenable and premature. This was especially so for the suggestion of mini-cycles of negotiations; they would probably be outside the terms of reference of the CTD. While commending countries adopting autonomous liberalization measures, he believed such measures served the interests of those countries more than their trading partners; they could congratulate themselves and look forward to an improvement in their economies. Considering the level of developing countries' bound tariffs, there was much scope for further liberalization. He thought the proposal for a Concessional Tariff Concession (CTC) or a Temporary Tariff Concession (TTC) to be accorded, not on an m.f.n. basis but an individual basis, raised the issue of the consistency with fundamental rules of the WTO such as non-discrimination, predictability and transparency. The proposal was ill- conceived and should be discarded.","WTCOMTDM4.pdf","Secretariat, European, Communities, Uruguay, Round, WTO"
"3983",3983,"15","15.      The representative of Japan said his delegation welcomed autonomous liberalization measures adopted by developing countries. While he thought it was important that other countries encouraged developing countries to continue with their liberalization efforts which often met with domestic resistance, the approach adopted during the Uruguay Round should be seen against the background of the special circumstances that existed at that time. Concessions were motivated partly by the desire to enhance the participation of developing countries in market access negotiations on goods. There had been a ground swell of support at the time to partly set aside the cardinal principle of reciprocity, in recognition                                                                              WT/COMTD/M/4                                                                              Page 5 of the special position of developing countries. To continue to do so would undermine the practical effectiveness of WTO principles. Moreover, it was very difficult to assess the value of autonomous liberalization measures which were taken in response to special group interests or in response to trading partners. This was why the Chairman of the Market Access Group presented guidelines rather than formal rules. These guidelines were not intended as rules to be followed subsequently. Developing countries already enjoyed, within the framework of the WTO, many benefits not available to other countries, and Japan was of the view that granting credit and recognition only to developing countries would affect the balance of rights and obligations between developed and developing countries. The representative of the United States supported the positions adopted by the European Communities and Japan on this issue.","WTCOMTDM4.pdf","Japan, Uruguay, Round, WTO, Chairman, Market, Access, Group, WTO, Japan, United, States, European, Communities, Japan"

The representative of Bangladesh thought the term ""autonomous trade liberalization measures"" was a misnomer as developing countries were coerced by the Bretton Woods Institutions to adopt such measures. It was unfortunate that these tariff and non-tariff concessions were not negotiated in the WTO and developing countries could not get negotiating credit.","WTCOMTDM4.pdf","Bangladesh, WTO"
"3985",3985,"17","17.      The representative of New Zealand thought it would be extremely difficult to devise a mechanism that would provide a real incentive to developing countries to adopt liberalization measures. His country had adopted extensive reforms in recent years, and he felt autonomous liberalization measures were more likely to be adopted because of domestic interests than because of benefits from trading partners. He emphasized the need for any solution to be WTO consistent, in particular with the m.f.n. principle. He agreed with the European Communities that concepts such as TTC and CTC in the Secretariat document could raise problems related to transparency and predictability. His delegation wished to reflect further on Zambia's interesting statement. However, he found it difficult to understand why developing countries had a problem with the proposition that credit could only be given for bound measures when they had abandoned import substitution policies and protectionism, and committed themselves to a market economy in order to participate fully in the multilateral trading system.","WTCOMTDM4.pdf","New, Zealand, WTO, CTC, Secretariat, Zambia"

The representative of Switzerland, while welcoming measures to liberalize a trading regime, said the adoption of such measures outside multilateral trade negotiations was influenced by economic circumstances and political considerations. Switzerland was in agreement with the European Communities that it was imperative that any proposed solution be consistent with basic principles of the WTO such as m.f.n., transparency and predictability. Such principles enabled trading partners to plan ahead and make necessary judgments. They were needed to ensure the stability of the multilateral trading system and were reflected in the requirement that all measures be bound in the WTO. Granting concessions for unbound liberalization measures would be contrary to the spirit of the WTO Agreement.","WTCOMTDM4.pdf","Switzerland, Switzerland, WTO, WTO, WTO"
"3987",3987,"19","19.      The representative of India referred to the statements that granting of credit would upset the balance of rights and obligations between developed and developing countries in the WTO, and that it was in the interest of developing countries to adopt these measures. He pointed out that it was not a universally accepted view that such measures benefited developing countries; the issue always drove a wedge between various interest groups in these countries. As stated in paragraph 12 of the background document, ""receiving credit and recognition for liberalization measures would help them in resisting domestic pressure not to liberalize trade, and would be an incentive for the continuation of such policies"". Operationalizing the concept so that it did not run counter to GATT/WTO principles would not be an easy task and he requested that the issue be maintained on the agenda of the CTD, until a solution satisfactory to all Members was found. Supporting India's comments, the representative of Mexico said that if credit was given for autonomous liberalization measures, this would encourage many countries to reduce or eliminate differences between applied and bound rates of duty. Expressing disappointment with the lack of progress, he asked Members to be flexible and constructive on this issue. The Committee took note of the comments made, including the requests that this issue be maintained on WT/COMTD/M/4 Page 6 the agenda of the CTD.

"3991",3991,"22","22.      The representative of Norway said the background document prepared by the Secretariat gave a clear overview of the current trends in world trade, and of the increasing participation of developing countries in the international trading system. The document also showed clearly that economies of developing countries as a group were the most dynamic in the world economy. In recent years, their performance had helped recovery of the global economy and contributed to its sustainability. While the integration of developing countries into the world economy should be a priority for the international trading system, the position of least-developed and other poorer countries merited special consideration. These countries had failed to benefit from a more open international trading system and unless the international community took immediate steps to increase their trading opportunities, they would be further marginalized in the world economy. While the WTO was not the place to discuss financial aid or debt relief, trade-related technical assistance and market access for products of export interest to LLDCs were within the mandate of the WTO. Pointing out the possibilities for special and differential treatment for LLDCs under GSP schemes after the tariffication introduced by the Agreement on Agriculture, he said Norway had taken action and expected other countries to do likewise. He urged more advanced developing countries and countries-in-transition to give special treatment to the exports of LLDCs so as to increase world trade. Improved market access conditions for textiles could also enhance greatly the participation of developing countries, especially LLDCs in the multilateral trading system. Increased trade-related technical assistance to developing countries would improve and deepen knowledge of WTO rules and enhance capacity-building in these countries and equip them to take advantage of the opportunities offered by the Uruguay Round. Assistance should be targeted at export- promotion programmes and at identifying new market opportunities for products of export interest to developing countries. Organizations such as the World Bank, IMF, ITC and UNCTAD were providing technical assistance in their spheres of competence, and, as had been noted by Ministers in the various declarations and decisions adopted at Marrakesh, further coherence in policy advice and assistance was necessary.","WTCOMTDM4.pdf","Norway, Secretariat, WTO, LLDCs, WTO, LLDCs, Norway, LLDCs, WTO, Uruguay, Round, World, Bank, IMF, ITC, UNCTAD, Marrakesh"
"3992",3992,"23","23.     The representative of India agreed with Norway that the fundamental issue was that of market access for products of export interest to developing countries. The performance of developing countries had not been uniform, and some regions had fared better than others; the picture for African and Middle                                                                             WT/COMTD/M/4                                                                             Page 7 Eastern countries was, he said, on the whole very dismal. The CTD had to recognize that developed countries should improve market access conditions for products of export interest to developing countries. He thought a coherent analysis would assist policymakers to design and implement the necessary measures to assist these countries. It was necessary to consider why developing countries had not increased their share of world trade, and to catalogue the problems inhibiting them from participating effectively in the multilateral trading system. The Secretariat could assist the CTD in its evaluation of this subject by undertaking a detailed study, analyzing the share in world trade of developing countries in major product categories - especially the ones in which they had traditionally enjoyed a comparative advantage - identifying if their shares in these product categories were increasing or decreasing and why it was so. This study could also examine the impact of technical standards, health and environmental regulations, sanitary and phytosanitary measures, and safeguard measures on the performance of developing countries in important sectors such as textiles and clothing. It could also examine the effects of restrictive business practices of transnational corporations. Such a comprehensive study would, in his view, benefit all WTO Members. The CTD needed to do more than just take note of the performance of developing countries in the international trading system, and a study such as the one proposed would show the very many problems facing developing countries. A forward-looking and analytical approach was needed, he said, so the CTD could address the problems facing developing countries. The representative of Venezuela expressed his support for the proposal made by India.","WTCOMTDM4.pdf","India, Norway, CTD, Secretariat, CTD, WTO, Members, CTD, CTD, Venezuela, India"

Countries which received substantial investments produced goods and services for the global market place and increased their participation in the international trading system. While technical assistance aimed at institutional and capacity-building were appreciated by developing countries, the importance of resource inflows had to be recognized.","WTCOMTDM4.pdf","Ghana"
"3994",3994,"25","25.      The representative of Canada, noting the exceptional performance of developing countries as a group in the international trading system, drew attention to the variations in the performance of countries. The dynamism shown by many developing countries in the last five to ten years had been remarkable. If present trends were sustained, they would continue to increase their share in world trade. The special situation of LLDCs needed to be recognized as they might not share in the benefits of the Uruguay Round. Commenting on the proposal made by India, he did not object to the principle, but was of the view that the CTD should not address subjects of interests to only developing countries. Agreeing with the representative of Ghana on the importance of investment, he said that if a study could be carried out on restrictive business practices, it could also address the treatment of foreign direct investment by host countries. Such a study would interest developed countries who were not always given the same treatment as nationals of the host state.","WTCOMTDM4.pdf","Canada, LLDCs, Uruguay, Round, India, CTD, Ghana"

The representative of the European Communities observed that while some developing countries were making substantial progress, the same could not be said of countries in Africa and the Middle East. The declining share in world trade of these countries was of concern to the European Communities. While his delegation appreciated the spirit in which the proposal by India was made, he doubted whether such a study would explain why countries in East Asia performed better than other developing countries, WT/COMTD/M/4 Page 8 especially considering that almost all of them faced the same market access conditions in developed countries. Also, he wondered whether the CTD could not use studies already prepared on the subject, instead of initiating new ones. The evidence suggested that it was not the trading policies of developed countries that were to be blamed, but the economic policies and other conditions in the non-performing countries.","WTCOMTDM4.pdf","European, Communities, Africa, Middle, East, India, East, Asia, Page, 8, CTD"

The representative of Peru expressed his support for the proposal made by India and said the CTD should not be satisfied with a document which only reproduced figures; it rather had to analyze the reasons for the lack of competitiveness of developing countries in the international trading system. The dynamism of international trade was affected by the participation of developing countries and this was a matter of importance to all Members of the WTO.

"3997",3997,"28","28.      The representative of Singapore said the critical question that arose from the interesting debate was why some regions and developing countries were not benefiting from the multilateral trading system. The CTD should analyze carefully the variations in performance of the regions and individual countries. The reasons for the decline in the share of world trade of African and Middle Eastern countries might not be due to a singular cause, such as market access difficulties or restrictive trade regulations. Given that the share of Asian and Latin American countries had increased, he was inclined to agree with the representative of the European Communities, that the differences in performance could be due to structural rigidities. ASEAN countries favoured the establishment of a Working Group to look into this issue and report to the CTD. Despite studies carried out by other institutions, it was necessary for the CTD to gain an insight into the problems facing developing countries, so it could propose appropriate policy responses. He offered delegates copies of a paper which touched on the issue under review.","WTCOMTDM4.pdf","Singapore, CTD, ASEAN, Working, Group, CTD, CTD"

Citing the example of the unequal treatment of developing countries in the GSP schemes of certain countries, he disagreed with the representative of the European Communities that all developing countries faced the same market access conditions. He had no objection to the study extending to investment which was a dynamic aspect of development. The representative of Australia said care should be taken not to duplicate work done by other institutions.

"3999",3999,"3","3.       The representative of Bangladesh, speaking on behalf of least-developed countries, stressed the importance of the CTD to developing countries. The Work Programme of the CTD and the Agreement Establishing the World Trade Organization (WTO), required it to review the special provisions relating to developing countries and to make recommendations to the General Council, and expectations were very high that the Committee would fulfil its mandate. He said document WT/COMTD/W/11 showed the declining share of least-developed countries (LLDCs) in world trade and that GDP per capita of LLDCs had fallen. The combination of these trends confirmed the marginalization of LLDCs in the international trading system. While the primary responsibility for development was with the LLDCs, the international community was committed by Ministers at Marrakesh to adopt positive measures to assist them in increasing their trade and investment opportunities. LLDCs were disappointed that no concrete measures had been adopted at recent meetings and global conferences. Losses for LLDCs through the erosion of preferences had been predicted in the 1995 Least-Developed Countries' Report published by UNCTAD. While the preferential treatment provided by GSP schemes was appreciated, there needed to be an assessment of gains and losses, so policymakers could formulate appropriate policy responses. WT/COMTD/W/10 was a useful document as it listed measures to increase the trade and investment opportunities of LLDCs. He thought it would be helpful if the Secretariat evaluated the impact of those measures on individual countries. This would assist the formulation of appropriate policy-responses. Expressing his appreciation for the technical assistance programme implemented by the WTO, he said more assistance was needed. The generous gesture of the Norwegian government in setting up a Trust Fund in the WTO was, he said, a step in the right direction.

The Chairman stated that while there was a common denominator on the need for examining the participation of developing countries in the international trading system from a qualitative perspective, it was not clear whether Members wanted a Working Group established or a study done by the Secretariat. He was therefore proposing the establishment of a Working Group to guide the Secretariat in the preparation of the study. Membership of the Group would be open to any interested Members. It would not carry out research on the relevant issues but direct the Secretariat on what should be done.

A significant input from CTD members would be necessary to ensure the practical usefulness of the study. Supporting the proposal made by the Chairman to establish a Working Group, he said he had a vested interest, as the findings and conclusions of the CTD could provide policy guidance for consideration by Ministers when they meet in Singapore in December 1996.

But now the subject of discussion was the participation of developing countries in the international trading system, and it was necessary to know why the share of some countries in world trade was declining. If the suggestion that restrictive business practices of transnational corporations should be looked into was objectionable and unacceptable to some Members, it could be dropped. However, it was his conviction that the CTD should look at the impact safeguard measures, environmental standards, phytosanitary and sanitary measures were having on the performance of developing countries in the multilateral trading system. 32.      The Chairman said under this agenda item, discussions should cover the implementation of GATT 1994 Part IV and the Enabling Clause, and the special provisions in the Multilateral Trade Agreements and Related Ministerial Decisions and Declarations. Under Part IV and the Enabling Clause there were two sub-items; first, preferential arrangements among developing countries, and second, changes in some GSP schemes. A notification from the Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA), circulated in WT/COMTD/N/3, provided information on the establishment a new regional grouping, and another from the Association of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN) in WT/COMTD/3 provided information on the ASEAN Free-Trade Area. Recent notifications by some Members of changes in their GSP schemes were contained in WTO documents WT/COMTD/N/1, 2, 4, 5 and 6, and their corresponding addenda and corrigenda.

In his view new elements introduced into some GSP schemes did not pay sufficient regard to fundamental concepts such as non-reciprocity and non-discrimination. He thought a study by the Secretariat on the ramifications of the new elements in some of these newly implemented GSP schemes might be helpful and that such a study should be done in coordination with UNCTAD which had considerable expertise in this area. He agreed with the Australian representative that work done by other institutions should not be duplicated. The representative of Bangladesh said his delegation, like India, was concerned about the design of some new GSP schemes. New conditionalities that were being imposed, especially in the area of environment, had the effect of negating benefits under such schemes. This placed weaker countries at a serious disadvantage.","WTCOMTDM4.pdf","India, GSP, Secretariat, GSP, UNCTAD, Bangladesh, India"

The current members of COMESA were Angola, Burundi, Comoros Islands, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Kenya, Lesotho, Malawi, Mauritius, Rwanda, Sudan, Swaziland, Tanzania, Uganda, Zaire, Zambia and Zimbabwe. The COMESA Treaty superseded the Preferential Trade Area for Eastern and Southern African States (PTA), and dealt with a broad range of subjects including cooperation in economic and social sectors. The Treaty aimed to promote a balanced and harmonious development of production and marketing structures, and the sustainable growth and development of its member states. COMESA aimed to raise the standard of living of the citizens of its member state, foster closer relations among its member states through joint adoption of macro-economic policies and programmes, and cooperation in all fields of economic activity. It provided for free movement of persons and the WT/COMTD/M/4 Page 10 right of establishment of business by nationals of member states. It also aimed to establish a customs union within a transitional period of ten years. COMESA was based on the principles of ""open regionalism"", it did not introduce any barriers to trade and it was firmly anchored in the multilateral system of trade.

The present Swiss scheme accorded duty-free entry to industrial products exported by LLDCs. Every effort was being made to increase concessions in the agricultural sector, and it was likely that some new products in this sector of export interest to LLDCs would be included.

Norway had seized the opportunities presented by the successful conclusion of the Uruguay Round and revamped its GSP scheme by improving the concessions to developing countries, especially to the least-developed among them. While improved market access under GSP schemes was important and could assist diversification of exports, Norway believed the integration of developing countries into the multilateral trading system required the adoption of appropriate economic and social policies and good management of the economy.

The representative of the European Communities said they had notified their amended GSP scheme to the Secretariat, and a copy of the relevant EC Council Regulation could be obtained from the Secretariat. Addressing the concerns expressed by India and Bangladesh on the inclusion of environmental and labour standards in the new GSP scheme of the EC and other countries, he said it was not the intention of the EC to penalize countries. The new EC scheme offered additional benefits to developing countries which complied with such standards; margins of preferences were not reduced, if countries did not meet the standards. The five year validity of the new EC scheme added predictability. The scheme aimed at maintaining existing margins of preferences through the mechanisms of modulation and of graduation. Preferential margins ranged from 15 per cent to 100 per cent depending on the sensitivity of the products. There were no quantitative restrictions. To protect as much as possible the margins of preferences enjoyed by countries under the previous scheme, the new margins of preferences would be applied to bound rates. The new scheme allowed the EC to withdraw preferences for some countries in certain specific sectors, under certain conditions. Preferences could, for example, be withdrawn if exports constituted 25 per cent of total exports to the EC. The objective of the new graduation policy was not to penalize ""successful"" countries, but to redistribute margins of preferences in a way that improved competitiveness of countries which most needed GSP benefits.","WTCOMTDM4.pdf","European, Communities, GSP, Secretariat, EC, Council, Regulation, Secretariat, India, Bangladesh, EC, EC, EC, EC, EC, EC, GSP"

The criteria for determining eligibility for preferential status were that the economy of the country or territory should be in the process of development; the country should be a member of UNCTAD; the country or territory should be willing to have preferential status                                                                              WT/COMTD/M/4                                                                              Page 11 under Japan's GSP scheme; and a cabinet order should proclaim that the benefits be extended to the country or territory. A country fulfilling these criteria would be declared a beneficiary. Japan accepted that there had been erosion of preferences due to Uruguay Round tariff reductions. However, Japan believed that such reductions, along with the higher level of bindings, offered increased stability and predictability in the trading system. Drawing attention to the many benefits resulting from the successful conclusion of the Uruguay Round, he added that GSP schemes were voluntary and donor countries had no obligation to compensate for loss of preferential margins. Notwithstanding that Japan had, on a voluntary basis, introduced improvements under their GSP scheme following the successful conclusion of the Uruguay Round, and reduced the preferential tariff rates for a number of agricultural products including twelve tropical products.","WTCOMTDM4.pdf","Japan, UNCTAD, Page, 11, Japan, Japan, Uruguay, Japan, Uruguay, GSP, Japan, Uruguay, Round"

The representative of India said he did not want to go into the details of the positive and negative aspects of the Round as this subject had been discussed on so many occasions. He did, however, want to raise the issue of the legal value of the ""special and differential provisions"" in the Uruguay Round Agreements. While the provisions giving longer time-periods for developing countries to implement their obligations did not raise any difficulties, the same could not be said of other provisions. For instance, he had been told that a provision which provided that a product under restraint should not be subjected to anti-dumping duties had no legal value. He was concerned that the special and differential provisions in Uruguay Round Agreements would not lead to enforceable legal rights. Developing countries had undertaken substantial obligations thinking that they could rely on such provisions. He requested the Secretariat to compile a list of the provisions which, prima facie, provided for special and differential treatment to developing countries and to indicate whether they were legally enforceable. He was not asking for any specific judgments, but rather a professional, objective and analytical listing of the provisions.","WTCOMTDM4.pdf","India, Uruguay, Uruguay, Secretariat"

The representative of Tanzania endorsed the statement earlier made by Bangladesh, on behalf of LLDCs, and associated his delegation with the statements by Zambia, India and Singapore. In the recent past, Tanzania had benefited from seminars organized by the Secretariat, and had received assistance on its notification and other obligations arising from WTO Agreement. His delegation appreciated the efforts and commitment of the Director-General to mobilize additional resources for technical assistance, especially for least-developed countries. Welcoming warmly the contribution of Norway in establishing a technical assistance Trust Fund in the WTO, he requested other donor countries to contribute to the Fund. Past assistance given to countries in the preparation of their Uruguay Round commitments and seminars on the implications of the Round were helpful. What was necessary now, was assistance to increase exports and to take advantage of the opportunities offered by the successful conclusion of the Round. He suggested that efforts should now focus on capacity-building and practical initiatives aimed at horizontal and vertical diversification of production and export structures. He said that the notion of ""demand-driven technical assistance"" should not prevent the Secretariat from being proactive; from advising countries on the nature of technical assistance they would need to make use of the opportunities in the international trading system. He stressed the importance of closer collaboration between the WTO and other institutions in the design and implementation of technical assistance programmes. Relevant organizations with which closer cooperation should be pursued included UNCTAD and ITC, and institutions such as the IMF, World Bank, European Communities, the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO), the United Nations Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO) and the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO).

He asked that the programme be structured to give practical assistance to LLDCs to increase their exports and take advantage of the Uruguay Round; it should take account of the development dimension. Practical measures were needed to increase the participation of LLDCs in the international trading system.

The representative of the European Communities said that, in 1996, they would be organizing, with the cooperation of the ACP and the WTO Secretariat, eight regional seminars in the ACP countries at a cost of about ECU 1.1 million. Six seminars would be held in the African region and fifty- four countries were expected to participate; one would be held in the Caribbean and another in the Pacific, with fifteen and eight countries expected to participate, respectively. Each country would be represented by two government officials and two representatives from the private sector. The main purpose of the seminars was to acquaint and increase the understanding of trade policymakers and businessmen of the results of the Uruguay Round. The trading opportunities and the general economic impact of the Uruguay Round would be analyzed in that context. The seminars would aim at identifying policy measures needed to get maximum benefit from post-Uruguay Round opportunities. A brief description of the programme, he said, could be found in the background document prepared by the Secretariat.","WTCOMTDM4.pdf","European, Communities, ACP, WTO, Secretariat, ACP, Caribbean, Pacific, Uruguay, Uruguay, Round, Secretariat"

The representative of Cuba while expressing his appreciation for the technical assistance activities of the WTO, said he agreed with Tanzania and Bangladesh that technical assistance should be increased and targeted at capacity-building and other practical initiatives which would assist developing countries to increase their exports and take advantage of the opportunities presented by the Uruguay Round. He encouraged the Secretariat to pursue the matter with other institutions with a capability to assist in these goals, so that resources could be used to maximum advantage. He stressed the importance of regional and sub-regional seminars on subjects such as notification requirements, in helping developing countries benefit from the multilateral trading system. He was encouraged by the gesture of the European Communities and hoped that his country would be able to participate in the seminar to be organized in the Caribbean region.","WTCOMTDM4.pdf","Cuba, WTO, Tanzania, Bangladesh, Uruguay, Secretariat, Caribbean"
"4018",4018,"47","47.      The representative of Switzerland said she had not had the opportunity to study in detail the document prepared by the Secretariat as they had received it the day before the meeting; she expected to comment on the document at the next meeting of the CTD. She then said that demands for technical assistance were growing, and so were the activities of institutions engaged in providing technical assistance. As this increased the prospect of duplication of functions, it was absolutely necessary to coordinate these various activities to ensure that resources were deployed to maximum benefit. The idea of diversification was important and was being studied and analyzed in many institutions such as UNCTAD, FAO and the World Bank. She reiterated that an efficient management of resources required proper coordination of activities. The new multilateral trading environment required the adaptation and intensification of programmes for technical assistance and cooperation. Her government was in the process of reviewing its trade policies to meet these new challenges. The revision of their GSP scheme was but one aspect of this review. She said that Switzerland, in cooperation with the UNCTAD Secretariat, would soon hold a seminar on ""Technical Cooperation for Trade and Development in the Face of Globalization"". The seminar was aimed at identifying concrete policies to facilitate the integration of developing countries and countries-in-transition into the multilateral trading system. In addition, the seminar would attempt to identify technical cooperation requirements flowing from the Uruguay Round Agreements, and to focus specifically on how such assistance could be delivered. The seminar would also consider and clarify the role of each institution in the delivery of technical assistance. It was expected that the conclusions of the seminar would be part of the background material for UNCTAD IX.

He found the amended GSP scheme notified by the EC very confusing. They were currently studying its details, although his country's exports were covered by a bilateral agreement. It had been brought to the attention of his delegation by UNCTAD that Australia had decided to phase out its GSP scheme for developing countries, with the exception of LLDCs and small-island states. The decision was regrettable. The representative of Australia said her country had notified the changes to its GSP scheme. As aspects of the new scheme seemed to be unclear to some Members, she had additional material on the scheme which she could share with them. 51.      The Chairperson of the Sub-Committee on Least-Developed Countries said the First Meeting of the Sub-Committee had taken place on 17 October 1995. The details of the proceedings could be found in WT/COMTD/LLDC/1. The meeting was well attended and, in her view, the general level of interest showed by Members demonstrated the seriousness accorded to the Marrakesh commitment to ensure the effective participation of LLDCs in the multilateral trading system. The Sub-Committee adopted its Programme of Work which was designed primarily to facilitate the full integration of LLDCs into the multilateral trading system. She hoped to carry out consultations on items that would be accorded ""priority status"" at the next meeting of the Sub-Committee in February 1996. The Work Programme represented a considerable challenge, and she was sure the Members of the Sub-Committee would work together to produce constructive results. She underlined the importance of technical assistance to LLDCs and said it would continue to play a vital role in enabling them to make the most of the opportunities and challenges of the post-Uruguay Round trading environment. She noted that the Norwegian initiative in establishing a technical assistance fund in the WTO for the benefit of LLDCs was widely commended by the Members of the Sub-Committee. The representatives of UNCTAD, ITC and the Technical Cooperation and Training Division informed the Sub-Committee of work in progress of special relevance to LLDCs. She urged Members of the CTD to be ready to play their full part in meeting the heavy responsibilities assigned to the Sub-Committee. Practical results could be achieved, she said, if Members worked together with determination.","WTCOMTDM4.pdf","Egypt, WTO, EC, UNCTAD, Australia, LLDCs, Australia, Members, Chairperson, WT/COMTD/LLDC, Members, Marrakesh, LLDCs, Sub-Committee, Work, Programme, Members, LLDCs, WTO, LLDCs, Members, UNCTAD, ITC, Technical, Cooperation, and, Training, Division, Members, CTD, Members"

An interesting proposal made by the Secretariat was being studied in Oslo and Members would be informed as soon as a decision was taken. He encouraged contributions from other countries to the Trust Fund, WT/COMTD/M/4 Page 14 which could do much to increase and strengthen the participation of developing countries in the multilateral trading system.

The draft work programme for 1996 basically followed the work programme of 1995, and included tentative dates for the meetings of the CTD in 1996. Regarding the two items of the 1995 work programme which were not included in the terms of reference of the CTD, i.e. review of the impact of the Uruguay Round on developing country Members and the issue of credit and recognition, he suggested that the proposed work programme for 1996 carry an explicit reference to the impact of the Uruguay Round. The issue of credit and recognition could, he thought, be discussed under ""Consideration of Measures and Initiatives to Assist the Expansion of Trade and Investment Opportunities of Developing Country Members, in particular on the Least-Developed Country Members""; it was not necessary for specific reference to be made to it in the programme of work.","WTCOMTDM4.pdf","Chairman, Members, CTD, CTD, CTD, Uruguay, Round, Members, Uruguay, Round, Expansion, of, Trade, and, Investment, Opportunities, of, Developing, Country, Members, Members"

According to the draft work programme, the issue would not come up for discussion until October 1996 and in his delegation's view, that was too late. The discussion of Item B could be brought forward in order for the Working Group to make a significant contribution to the work of the CTD. Peru was willing to participate in the Working Group.

"4036",4036,"9","9.      The representative of Zambia endorsed the statement made by Bangladesh, on behalf of the LLDCs. Discussions on whether the Uruguay Round had worsened the position of least-developed countries was a priority neither for Zambia nor for other least-developed countries. The economic decline in least-developed countries had not been arrested because of the successful conclusion of the Uruguay Round as these countries faced structural problems. The share of LLDCs' exports in world trade had declined from 0.6 per cent in 1975 to less than 0.3 per cent in 1992. Out of the over 40 LLDCs, only two (Zambia and Bangladesh) had exports in excess of $1 billion. Their share in world imports was negligible; in 1992, it amounted to less than 0.7 per cent. Unless something was done at both the domestic and international level, the trend would continue. Political will to do something tangible for least-developed countries was needed. Despite assurances given by almost every major intergovernmental institution to assist African and other poorer countries, no new or serious initiatives had been proposed. LLDCs were aware that to be part of the mainstream, much had to be done by them. In the first place it would require the adoption of market-tested policies and fiscal discipline.

They accepted trade as an engine of growth and were committed to export-oriented development strategies. Referring to the ongoing discussion, he said LLDCs should be granted credit by their trading partners for autonomous liberalization measures. The argument that credit could be given only when the measures were bound in the WTO ignored the fact that very few LLDCs reversed trade liberalization measures. The best guarantee against any such reversal was the discipline of markets. He requested trading partners to take into account domestic pressures they faced; by not binding all of their autonomous trading liberalization measures, LLDCs were able to carry their constituencies with them and continue with their reform programmes. He called for an ad-hoc solution, until a permanent solution was found to the issue of ""credit and recognition"".","WTCOMTDM4.pdf","Zambia, Bangladesh, LLDCs, Uruguay, Round, Zambia, Uruguay, LLDCs, LLDCs, Zambia, Bangladesh, LLDCs, Page, LLDCs, WTO, LLDCs, LLDCs"

The Chairman said that as chairman of the CTD, and as a representative of an LDC himself, he wished to express his deep appreciation to Ambassador Fuller. Ambassador Fuller had made a significant contribution to the Sub-Committee and the work of the Sub-Committee had, in turn, contributed to the process of integrating the LDCs into the multilateral trading system. The period of his chairmanship had been a distinctive one during which much was achieved. The Sub-Committee had agreed to the substantive contributions of the WTO deliverables to the thematic session on trade at the Third UN Conference on LDCs3 which was held in Brussels in May 2001. In the period of his stewardship, the Sub-Committee had lent its support to the LDCs in preparing for the ministerial meeting in Zanzibar as part of the overall preparatory process for the Doha Ministerial Conference. Above all, the Sub-Committee had appreciated Ambassador Fuller's leadership in the negotiations that led to the adoption of the WTO Work Programme for LDCs in February 2002. Ambassador Fuller's leadership and deep personal commitment had been a critical factor behind the concrete results achieved.      On behalf of the Sub-Committee he formally expressed appreciation for Ambassador Fuller's work.

The representative of Sweden said that, on behalf of his ambassador who deeply regretted not to be able to attend the meeting, he wished to express gratitude to Members for electing him Chairman of the Sub-Committee on Least-Developed Countries. It was a great honour for his country Sweden and for him personally. The Government of Sweden was fully committed to supporting the efforts of LDCs to integrate into the multilateral trading system and the global economy. In that regard, the WTO had a significant role to play. LDC's integration required special consideration from other Members of LDCs' interests and concerns. It also required active commitment from LDCs in the work of the WTO. He wished to assure Members of the CTD of his deep personal commitment to the task of LDCs' integration process. The election was a great honour and a big responsibility, which he accepted. He believed that the effective execution of the role required of the Sub-Committee already was underway with the adoption of the WTO Work Programme for LDCs. He would attach priority and his full attention to the implementation of the Work Programme in the Sub-Committee. He recognized that there was substantive work to be done, including focussed attention on market access opportunities for LDCs; accessions; trade-related TA, including through the IF; and mainstreaming and following up on Ministerial Decisions in favour of LDCs. He counted and would rely on the support of the WTO Secretariat and all Members, in particular the LDCs, in moving that work forward. The CTD and the Sub-Committee were essential for making the WTO system as a whole respond to the interests of the LDCs.

It is not sales of tangible products carried out through electronic networks but rather sales of digital products that raise novel and difficult questions for the collection of consumption taxes. The implications of the technological changes for territorially based taxed systems are vast. First, there is the sheer increase in cross-boarder transactions. Second, the digitization of information creates difficulties in defining the source, origin and destination of both consumption and production. The principle challenge is to determine how to implement geographically limited tax systems in a technological environment that renders geographical borders essentially irrelevant. The difficulty of tracing transactions enhances the danger of increased tax avoidance and evasion.

The classification issue is important because of the structural differences between GATT and GATS. The levels of benefits under GATT can differ significantly from those available under GATS in the short term. Questions that need to be considered in this context include:         1.      What are the implications of e-commerce for the promotion of economic                 development and what are the implications for development of erecting barriers to e-                 commerce?         2.

"4074",4074,"123","123.     Delegations heard that there was a drop in spending on e-commerce in late 2001 due to the overall economic downturn. The information technology (IT) boom is over and doing business using electronic means is business as usual for the private sector. However, the decrease in the spending on e-commerce is not a sign of a lack of interest in information technologies on the part of company executives. It is rather due to the limited availability of financial resources. The private sector experimented with information technologies in the 1995-2000 period, which led to the over-spending that created the IT ""bubble"". Firms currently tend to spend on internal information technology rather than on external e-commerce. Nevertheless, the private sector expects to increase technology spending over the next few years.         4          WT/COMTD/35.         5           The WTO Work Programme on Electronic Commerce, adopted by the General Council on 25 September 1998, is contained in document WT/L/274.        6          The report of the 1999 seminar can be found in document WT/COMTD/18.        7           The report of the 2001 seminar is an attachment (beginning on page 32) to document WT/COMTD/M/35.

In order to be competitive in a market where mergers and acquisitions are daily affairs, companies need to be global and use e-business. Globalisation of large business affects both developed and developing countries. It is becoming increasingly expensive to extract oil. It is therefore necessary to reduce costs to be competitive. One way is to reduce costs of extraction and refining. Another is to maximize the use of scarce and dispersed resources. New information and communication technologies (ICTs) are useful in that respect. Firms take advantage of the technical advances that ICTs provide and have completely different ways of transferring information than just a couple of years ago. They need to innovate with the use of modern technologies to lower transaction costs and improve market information to deal with intensified competition. ICTs are also used to identify best practices, to mitigate risks, and in training.","WTCOMTDM40.pdf","ICTs"

The large majority of on-line trade is going to be business-to-business (including raw materials to manufacturing and manufactures to distribution) rather than business-to-consumer e-commerce. It will not only involve business-to-business trade in developed countries but also between developed and developing county companies and among developing country firms. Business- to-business e-commerce is shown to have taken off much faster than business-to-consumer trade. Reasons given include the diversity of consumers, geographical differences, and consumer concerns on security issues. Estimates suggest that over 90 per cent of e-commerce is business-to-business. Apart from business-to-business and business-to-consumer e-commerce, firms are also using e- commerce internally. E-business includes e-learning and e-collaboration where electronic contacts replace physical presence, always with the aim of reducing internal and external transaction costs and achieving better, quicker, safer and cost-efficient information flows.

"4081",4081,"13","13.     Deputy Director-General Miguel Rodriguez-Mendoza, who had worked on the design of the intensive training courses for senior policy makers, said that Annex I of the TA Plan called for the WT/COMTD/M/40 Page 4 initiation of a training programme on the Doha negotiations. The programme focussed on the training of trade negotiators of WTO Members and Observers from developing countries and economies in transition specifically on the issues central to the Doha Development Agenda. The main purpose was to strengthen those countries effective participation in the Doha negotiations and work programme through policy analysis and a deepened understanding of the issues involved. The Secretariat was in the process of implementing that programme which was complementary to other TA and capacity building activities included in the Annual TA Plan. The Secretariat was planning to conduct a series of two-week training activities on the Doha negotiations and Work Programme for government officials with responsibility in the Doha negotiations. The programme took into account the experience of a successful course that the WTO, together with the Organization of American States and the Georgetown University, had been conducting for the past five years. The Secretariat attempted to replicate that experience in other regions as part of the mandate for TA and capacity building adopted by the Ministers at Doha. The purpose of that programme was not to focus on an explanation of the WTO Agreements, but rather to concentrate on the Doha negotiating issues. In that sense, it was a pilot activity devoted to increasing the understanding of the negotiating issues and proposals, and to facilitate the participation of developing countries in the debate. To achieve that task, the Secretariat was not only counting on the expertise of its own staff, but also on that of independent experts and resource persons from the various regions. The Advanced Training Programme the Secretariat was working on would be implemented in two phases. In a first phase, the Secretariat contemplated to organize up to eight training activities. Two in Africa, two in Asia, two in Latin American and the Caribbean, one in Transition Economies and one for Arab countries. That first phase would cover the period from April 2002 to the Mexico Ministerial Conference. In the second phase of the programme, which extended between the Mexico Ministerial and the end of the negotiations, the intention was to organize a second set of training activities in all the regions involved. Although financing for those activities was secured by the Doha Development Agenda Global Trust Fund, the Secretariat was in the process of contacting some regional organizations, including regional development banks, as well as some academic institutions in the various regions to make the courses a joint effort by the institutions concerned. In preparation for those activities, he had been in touch with a number of delegations. Specifically, he had met with the African countries, with the CARICOM countries, with the CEFTA+ group and with China, and it was his intention to continue the dialogue with other developing country Members to get their insights and advise as to how to make the activities meaningful, and actually to strengthen the participation of developing countries in the negotiations. He had received support and enthusiasm for the programme from the countries concerned, and would keep the CTD informed of further developments regarding the implementation of the training activity.","WTCOMTDM40.pdf","Director-General, Miguel, Rodriguez-Mendoza, WTO, Members, Doha, Development, Agenda, Doha, Secretariat, Secretariat, Doha, Work, Programme, Doha, WTO, Organization, of, American, States, Georgetown, University, Secretariat, Doha, WTO, Doha, Secretariat, Secretariat, Secretariat, Africa, Asia, Caribbean, Mexico, Mexico, Doha, Development, Agenda, Global, Trust, Fund, Secretariat, CARICOM, CEFTA, China, Members, CTD"

"4084",4084,"132","132.     One of the most significant issues raised by e-commerce for income tax regimes is related to jurisdiction. Countries generally exercise jurisdiction over taxable income on the basis of residence or source. Both are likely to become more elusive with e-commerce. “Permanent establishment” and ""fixed base"" are difficult to determine with respect to electronic transactions.","WTCOMTDM40.pdf",""
"4085",4085,"133","133.    The difficulty of tracing transactions and verifying the parties to a transaction also enhances the danger of increased tax avoidance and evasion. Insofar as a jurisdiction is relying on the residence principle as the basis for taxation, e-commerce will provide enhanced opportunities to move income out of high-tax jurisdictions. Source-based taxation is at least as difficult, as e-commerce does not seem to occur in any particular physical location but takes place in the nebulous world of cyberspace.","WTCOMTDM40.pdf",""
"4086",4086,"134","134.    Another problem for income tax regimes is the characterization of income. E-commerce is generating countless transactions that raise income characterization issues whose resolution is uncertain under existing categories of income. The characterization of income either as royalty income or as business profits might have important implications for developing countries and countries in transition. For example, a developed country company might have some kind of subsidiary in a developing country that uses and pays for the services of a database from the main company. The main company could then attempt to have that income classified as business profits in WT/COMTD/M/40 Page 30 order to avoid to pay tax in the developing country, claiming that it does not have any permanent establishment in that country. The developing country government could argue that the payment in question is royalty income and that it has the right to impose a withholding tax as the source of the royalty income would be the developing country. One important question with respect to direct taxes is thus what the appropriate rules are for the division of the taxable income between different countries.","WTCOMTDM40.pdf",""
"4087",4087,"135","135.     Abandoning the source-based principle in favour of the residence-based principle in the context of e-commerce would violate accepted international norms of tax policy. In addition, it is by no means clear that residence-based taxation provides a panacea for the difficulties of assigning income from e-commerce on a source basis. A residence-based rule raises troublesome questions of international tax equity. A shift to residence-based taxation would be a boon to the United States as the world’s leader in the production of electronic content. The reduced need for a seller or service provider to have a physical presence in the country of the customer threaten to shift the balance of taxing jurisdiction and revenue in favour of the country of residence. Since income flows between developed and developing countries often are severely out of balance, such a shift could have significant revenue consequences.","WTCOMTDM40.pdf","United, States"
"4088",4088,"136","136.     A third problem for income tax regimes is the potential for transfer pricing. Defining the price of a physical good transferred between related enterprises might be difficult enough. Defining the price of digital transfers is even more difficult as the units within which the transfers are made are difficult to trace and as the value might to a large extent be intangible.","WTCOMTDM40.pdf",""

In examining the impact of e- commerce on consumption taxes, a distinction should be made between value added taxes (VAT) like those adopted by members of the European Union and the retail sales tax (RST) in force in the United States. The problems created by e-commerce for indirect taxation are in many ways analogous to those for direct taxation.

There is not yet any perfect system for the collection of indirect taxes on electronic deliveries. Consumers might have to self-assess how much VAT they are obliged to pay.

Characterization is important because liability for the VAT depends on the place of supply, and the determination whether a supply is one of goods or services is critical in determining if and when the VAT is due as well as establishing the party responsible for paying it to the taxing authorities.","WTCOMTDM40.pdf",""
"4092",4092,"14","14.      Deputy Director General Mr. Ravier continued with his sixth point relating to ownership through self-financing participants. He underscored the necessity for increased beneficiary ownership in WTO TA. Ownership could be expressed in various ways. It had to be recognized that WTO training and TA activities were integral parts of human resources development (HRD), a key component of national economic development. WTO delivery of training and TA could only be a supplement to the necessary national expenditures for HRD. One was not a substitute for the other. In that regard, he was pleased to report that some delegations were considering self-financing the participation of government officials in selected WTO training activities. That was a welcome development since it would give a greater degree of ownership. He recommended it to other delegations who were in a position to do so. He said that he wished to re-emphasise a point mentioned in a previous update; it was necessary for TA beneficiaries to also include their TA priorities and demands either in their Poverty Reduction Strategy Papers (PRSPs) or in their national plans for economic development. PRSPs were the basis for World Bank and International Monetary Fund policy lending and grant support. It was important to know that trade-related TA activities and priorities were integral to national development plans, and should be reflected as such in those plans and/or strategies for poverty reduction.

Governments need to agree on how to divide the income tax base among themselves. The challenges posed by e-commerce for tax administration are enormous. However, the implications of modern information technologies for tax administrations are not exclusively negative. New technologies create increased opportunities for streamlining tax administration by replacing paper documentation with electronic data interchange (EDI), by providing for electronic filing of tax returns, and by automating other aspects of tax reporting and compliance. Some countries might almost be able to ""skip the paper generation"".

Import duties account for a small share of 2-3 per cent of total government revenue in developed countries, whereas it is more important for developed countries where it accounts for almost 20 per cent. Customs duties are normally levied on physically imported goods. The increase in the number of goods that can be traded digitally, and the customs moratorium on electronic transmissions, have raised the possibility of a loss of customs revenue, especially for developing countries.","WTCOMTDM40.pdf",""
"4095",4095,"142","142.    The products concerned are a limited group. Digitized products can be defined as products that can be identified by HS code, delivered physically (via carrier medium such as cd, tape, diskette, hard copy), and be transformed into digital format and transferred digitally (via networks). Digitized products include items such as books, newspapers and other printed material, software, recorded music, film, video and video games. According to 1999 statistics, developed countries accounted for more than 80 per cent of both imports and exports of these products. However, digitized products accounted for less than one per cent of the value of world imports and exports respectively and less than half a per cent of developing country imports and exports. Nevertheless, the growth of developing country digitized exports has been higher than the corresponding growth rates for developed countries in the last few years. This indicates that developing countries are increasing their share of digitized exports.","WTCOMTDM40.pdf",""
"4096",4096,"143","143.     Considering the tariffs on products that could be delivered in digitized form over the Internet, developing countries applied an average MFN rate of about 15 per cent whereas in developed countries the figure was under 4 per cent in 1999. However, there are large variations between individual countries in each group and between products. Although developing countries only import about 20 per cent of world digitized imports, the higher import duties they levy means that developing countries receive more than 60 per cent of world tariff revenue from products in this category. Other duties levied on imports of products that could be delivered in digitized form over the Internet include customs surcharges such as fees, uplifts, statistical taxes and port taxes which on an average adds about 7 per cent to the customs tariff, and internal taxes such as VAT, sales taxes and consumption taxes which add an additional 15 per cent to the tariff. World tariff revenue on digitized products amounted to just less than one billion US$ in 1999 whereas the figure is 8 billion US$ when other customs surcharges and internal taxes are included.","WTCOMTDM40.pdf",""
"4097",4097,"144","144.    Although developing countries receive the largest share when tariff revenue alone is considered (about US$ 0.6 billion out of the world total of almost one billion US$), developed countries have the lion's share when all import revenue, including consumption taxes are considered. Nevertheless, tariff revenue from digitized products in 1999 was minimal to total government revenue in both developed (0,04 per cent) and developing countries (0,16 per cent). The share of total government revenue stemming from the revenue of imported digitized products is 0.6 per cent in developing countries and 0.4 per cent in developed countries. The potential relative revenue losses are thus relatively higher in developing countries than in developed countries although they are small in terms of overall government revenue. As developing countries generally tend to rely to a greater extent on tariffs for their government revenue, any tariff reduction is costly. This is nothing specific to e-commerce.

The e-commerce classification issue concerns whether digital deliveries of certain types of products fall under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) or the General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS) framework. This issue seems to have become one of the most difficult and sensitive issues of the entire WTO Work Programme on e-commerce. The classification issue relates to other questions such as customs duties and the potential differences in how internal taxes are dealt with. However, the classification issue is not only a revenue consideration, it is also linked to levels of liberalization and benefits across the two agreements. In this connection, it is important to note that the Moratorium on customs duties on electronic transmissions relates only to customs duties and not to other taxes.","WTCOMTDM40.pdf","General, Agreement, on, Tariffs, and, Trade, GATT, General, Agreement, on, Trade, in, Services, WTO, Work, Programme"

It had also been observed, although no final conclusion has been arrived at, that the modes of supply through which services are defined in the Services Agreement (GATS) make no distinctions with regard to the technologies involved in the delivery. There are no references or exclusions of any technology that might be used for electronic supply. If that could be formally agreed, it would mean that existing obligations and commitments of the GATS apply to e-commerce in services. With regard to goods, the Council for Trade in Goods has observed that when a purchase is made on-line but the product delivered physically, the normal GATT rules apply. However, the Council for Trade in Goods has left open the question of how to treat a product that can be traded in either physical or digital form.","WTCOMTDM40.pdf","WTO, Work, Programme, Council, for, Trade, in, Services, GATS, Council, for, Trade, in, Goods, GATT, Council, for, Trade, in, Goods"

Trade in these products amounts to approximately 1 per cent of total merchandize trade and less than 1 per cent of total duties collected world wide. Moreover, only some on-line products are concerned as much of what can be delivered electronically is regarded as services. The vast majority of services are therefore not at stake. Most media and entertainment products never did cross borders in physical formats and are clearly regarded as services, such as television and radio programming and broadcasting for example. Approximately 99 per cent of merchandise trade and more than 99 per cent of duties collected world wide are not at stake and there has not yet been any dispute with respect to the classification problem.","WTCOMTDM40.pdf",""

"4104",4104,"150","150.     As already noted, classification has become a pivotal issue because of the structural differences between the GATT and the GATS. The essence of GATT is to reduce or eliminate tariffs over time through the binding of tariff concessions, but tariffs are permitted under those rules. National treatment of internal taxes is obligatory under GATT. On the other hand, tariffs are so uncommon in services trade that the GATS does not even mention them. National treatment for internal taxes is negotiated service by service under GATS. Levels of benefits extended by GATT can thus differ significantly from those available under GATS in the short term. While quantitative restrictions are prohibited under the GATT and national treatment is obligatory, under GATS the progressive elimination of barriers to trade is negotiated and national treatment progressively implemented. The differences between the agreements are largely eliminated if the full implementation of each is considered. In addition, the scope of the GATS is wider. The main difference between the two agreements remaining with full liberalization would be the scope. The GATS covers not only the imports of a product but four different modes of supply and there are benefits accruing to the suppliers of the products, in particular through ""commercial presence"" mode. Generalizing, it can be said that the GATT corresponds to the GATS mode 1 which is ""cross-border supply"". The classification issue is thus both limited to a small group of products which can be traded on-line and/or physically, and to only one of the four modes of supply under the GATS.","WTCOMTDM40.pdf","GATT, GATS, GATT, GATT, GATS, GATS, GATT, GATS, GATT, GATS, GATS, GATT, GATS"

This may continue to be the case for some time to come. In some cases, the content is similar or even identical but receives different treatment depending on whether GATT or GATS applies. Even if the status quo was accepted as an option some classification work might still be needed as neither GATT nor GATS classification schemes may fully or unambiguously cover some of the products or content concerned. If the products concerned were classified as goods it may clarify the situation with respect to tariffs and national treatment for these products. However, it could have unintended consequences for the scope of the GATS as it might affect the status of other on-line services beyond those actually at issue. On the other hand, if the products concerned were to be classified as services, it may clarify the status of most forms of e-commerce. It would nevertheless leave open the issue of differing treatment of similar products delivered by physical and electronic means and it could raise questions on the GATT status of the content of digital products that remain traded in physical formats.","WTCOMTDM40.pdf","GATT, GATS, GATT, GATT, GATS, GATT"
"4106",4106,"152","152.      What needs to be considered with respect to tariff revenue is how significant the value of GATT tariffs are on these products and what the status of tariffs is under GATS. As concerns tax revenue, Members are entitled to non-discriminatory internal taxes under both GATT and GATS and need to consider the feasibility and desirability of taxing on-line products. With respect to the levels of benefits, the implications of classification concerns for products traditionally subject to sensitivities and trade restrictions are different from the implications for products for which freer trade has been the norm. Delegations will have to consider if it is reasonable that a determination on classification, in itself, might result in the removal of barriers on certain products or in the evaporation of benefits heretofore available for others, and if there is a case for possible consideration of sector-specific solutions for certain products.","WTCOMTDM40.pdf","GATT, GATS, Members, GATT, GATS"

"4109",4109,"155","155.    The European Communities (EC) has experience of the implications for consumption taxes of e-commerce, specifically in relation to the European Union Value Added Tax (VAT) system. The current urgency is the potential competitive imbalances that could be created. The EC is not of the view that there is a need for an international moratorium on domestic taxes on e-commerce. However, there is a need for an international agreement on fundamental principles. One of the building blocks was laid at the OECD's Ottawa Conference in 1998 where, as far as consumption taxes are concerned, there was a measure of agreement on two general principles. One was that if e- commerce transactions are to be taxed, then taxation should accrue to the jurisdiction in which consumption takes place. The second was that for consumption tax purposes, these transactions should not be treated as goods. When the European Union considered applying these principles to its own tax systems there were some potential points of tension. Three possible paths could be taken. One was to wait for e-business to mature before taking any action. The second was to adopt a moratorium on e-commerce taxes and remove them where they had already been applied. Thirdly, there was the path the EC opted for, which was to change the tax system to take account of cross- border transactions in e-commerce where they cause tension within the domestic regime.","WTCOMTDM40.pdf","EC, EC, OECD, Ottawa, Conference, European, Union, EC"
"4110",4110,"156","156.     The Council of the European Community is currently in the process of changing the VAT legislation to take into account specific problems raised by e-commerce. The new laws will take effect on 1 July 2003.9 The EC is the first large jurisdiction to attempt to implement the OECD principles. The reasons include that the EC has a VAT system with a general tax on consumption (whether a good or a service). For businesses there is a provision for credit for input tax. These changes are not revenue driven. The intention is rather to rectify a competitive imbalance. What had happened was that the EC effectively taxed exported services while imported services became tax exempted. The potential for competitive imbalance was found in the areas of software, Web-hosting, programme maintenance, data processing, entertainment, music, sports events, distance teaching and gambling. The tax rules with respect to broadcasting were changed at the same time, as the tax problems were similar and as convergence in technology will bring them together. The competitive imbalances occur where EU-based companies are required to pay VAT whereas companies supplying EC consumers from a base abroad are tax exempted. What the EC will do is to change the place of supply (taxation) in order for all companies supplying EC consumers with digitally delivered services to be taxed equally. The EC attempts to introduce the changes to create a level playing field without disrupting legitimate business activities.","WTCOMTDM40.pdf","European, Community, EC, OECD, EC, EC, EC, EC, EC, EC"

Most tax systems deal with business-to-business taxation on a self-assessment basis in the jurisdiction where consumption is deemed to take place. The place of taxation for consumption is not always easy to determine for intangibles, especially where intangibles are linked to physical goods. Such cases create opportunities for businesses to split the transactions among different companies. For internal business-to-business transactions the EC has a system with tax collection taking place in one of the 15 EC Member states. The new tax laws will be put in place for an initial three-year period after which the evolution of e-commerce will be evaluated. It can be asked why, for a relatively small area of activity, has EC gone the trouble to make a significant change in a tax system to attempt to collect taxes from companies which do not have a physical presence in the jurisdiction. The reason is the potential importance of e-commerce for the tax-base for the European VAT system. Malaysia","WTCOMTDM40.pdf","EC, EC, EC, Member, EC, Malaysia"

The tool is the Multimedia Super Corridor (MSC) which will enhance Malaysia's competitiveness. The strategy is first to offer an ideal multi-media environment to attract world-class companies which in turn can catalyze Malaysian companies to become world class over time. The Malaysian MSC is more than just a technology park. It has special cyberlaws, policies and practices and modern infrastructure. The seven flagship applications are smart schools, multi-purpose cards, electronic government, telehealth, R&D clusters, borderless marketing centers and a Worldwide Manufacturing Web. Progress to date (i.e. during the seven years the project has existed) include almost 700 companies with MSC status out of which 50 are world-class, the initiation of the Government multi-purpose card, growing investments in technology and high value-added economic activities, rapid growth in sales and exports, creation of new knowledge-based employment opportunities, growth in higher learning institutions, increased SME participation, and spin-offs to the rest of the economy including enhanced productivity. The idea is for the MSC to expand to all of Malaysia before 2020 and for Malaysia to leap-frog into leadership in the knowledge economy.

"4115",4115,"160","160.     Some lessons have been learned. Nations need to identify clusters for industrial development and reposition themselves to be at the centre of the virtual marketplace. E-commerce reduces the transaction costs which represent a large portion of the activities within an economy, thus leading to efficiency gains. E-commerce has also led to the destruction of the vertically integrated value chain. Consumers have the choice of new intermediaries or no intermediaries at all. Enhanced information and new channels make it easier for companies to buy at lowest cost and sell at highest price. The global implications are that first movers enjoy entrenched positions. Companies will move location if the policies are more favourable elsewhere. There will be winners and losers in the knowledge age and companies and governments need to be ready. Government interventionist policies are needed to correct for market imperfections. Capital will gravitate towards a few ""hubs"" which have developed a critical mass of users and producers.

The existing legal framework in Malaysia is insufficient. The role of existing regulators has to be reviewed. Changes to the regulatory framework is necessary to boost consumer confidence. The aim is to expand existing laws to apply equally to online and offline transactions with minimal and light-handed interventions. Self regulation is promoted and consumer guidelines should be drawn up. There have been conflicts between trademark rights and registration of domain names and there has been inequality in bargaining power in registration of domain names. Much work is needed to develop an intellectual property management system.

"4118",4118,"163","163.      The Malaysian Government has come across several difficulties in taxing e-commerce. For income taxes it has experienced the difficulty of applying ""source-based"" taxation and the question of whether a server is considered a ""physical presence"" for tax purposes. Another difficulty experienced is that the tax provisions do not cover multi-jurisdictional transactions and that there are enforcement problems as information can be encrypted and lack audit trails. The Government might consider the introduction of stringent regulations as to identity, legislation that would impose a duty on the Internet Service Provider (ISP) to obtain information from businesses registering with them, and powers to decode encrypted private data. It might also attempt to renegotiate double tax agreements as in current agreements it is not clear whether websites or host servers are permanent establishments subject to tax. The Malaysian Stamp Duty Act of 1949 based on paper instruments is difficult to enforce on electronic documents. The Government might try to extend the stamp duty to electronic documents. For other types of taxes the difficulties include the fact that record keeping requirements are based on paper documents. Enforcement provisions should provide for electronic records. The delivery of intangible goods increases the ease of avoiding the payment of duties and current provisions for enforcement are insufficient to capture e-commerce transactions. The monitoring, audit and investigative powers of the Government therefore need to be enhanced to take modern information technologies into account.","WTCOMTDM40.pdf",""

It provides the potential for more sustainable development, the creation of better jobs, expanded world trade and improved social conditions. It offers the possibility of breaking the cycle of incremental change with marginal improvements or stagnation by vastly improving efficiency, reducing transactions costs and expanding both markets and products at an unprecedented rate. E-commerce involves much more than transactional activity. It involves marketing, customer service, problem solving and research. Research is vital for many businesses who need to track things such as commodity prices to keep the local suppliers honest.","WTCOMTDM40.pdf",""

The Government of Barbados believes that this should be done without distorting economic and technological choices. Any changes require a reassessment of the effectiveness of government policies towards commerce and of traditional commercial practices and procedures, most of which were formed in an analogue world with a different image of commerce in mind. Present experiences with e-commerce fall into two broad categories: trade in physical and digital products and trade in a growing number of services. Because of the nascent stage of development of e-commerce there is much uncertainty about the nature of the trade that will take place in intangible or digital products and a difficulty in determining the classification of such products as goods or services.","WTCOMTDM40.pdf","Barbados"
"4123",4123,"168","168.     At present all electronically ordered and/or paid physical products are taxed at the port of entry through the application of import duties and VAT. However, electronically transmitted products such as software, music and video, and other services escape both import duties and VAT. This loss in revenue for the Government of Barbados must be balanced with the need to encourage the growth of e-commerce to maximize the sale of goods and services from Barbados to the rapidly expanding global electronic market place.","WTCOMTDM40.pdf","Barbados, Barbados"
"4124",4124,"169","169.    In light of the potential for the expansion of the economy by utilizing e-commerce to reach a wider market and to focus on specific high yield customers, the Government of Barbados believes that it would not be prudent to implement direct taxation on trade in digital products and services delivered through electronic means at this time. Thus the Government of Barbados supports the provisional agreement not to introduce any new tax on electronic transmissions through which digital products and services are delivered. Governments must also be mindful of the rapidly changing technological environment and the introduction of second Internet (II) that will expand the range and complexity of e-commerce through the introduction of high speed transmissions coupled with enhanced security systems. This will introduce new products and new ways of conducting business which are unpredictable at this time.","WTCOMTDM40.pdf","Government, of, Barbados, Government, of, Barbados"

"4126",4126,"170","170.     The Government of Barbados will continue to develop systems that integrate with e- commerce and facilitate the clearance of physical goods through the port. In this regard there is an existing system of integration of express delivery carrier operations with the customs department which facilitates the automatic download of an aircraft's manifest upon take off which allows for the automatic generation of tax computation for the entire manifest and the payment of all import duties and VAT for all cargo upon landing. This system can be expanded to all air and sea freight carriers. The technology can thus be used to enhance the discipline and the accuracy of the current system of tax collection. As e-commerce is a dynamic activity, it would be imprudent to burden the private sector with cumbersome regulations and tax systems which would inhibit experimentation in the current period of developing new products, services and delivery systems. A vision could be the steam engine developed in Europe with a man carrying a red flag walking in front of it to ensure that it did not go too fast. The Government of Barbados does not intend to put any red flags in front of the Internet. Barbados stands to gain much more by maintaining an environment conducive to the growth and development of e-commerce than by introducing new and restrictive measures to tax digital WT/COMTD/M/40 Page 38 products and services at this point in time. Barbados's experience to date does not indicate a significant loss in revenue while there has been a positive contribution in several areas. This includes the expansion of the hospitality industry and the development of repeat customers, direct marketing of local products, and the development of new business opportunities that expand economic activity beyond the island shores into the region, the Western Hemisphere and the global marketplace.

The Government of Kenya recognises the important role that e-commerce can play for trade and development and in particular for poverty alleviation. However, the current focus is on developing policies which recognize the electronic aspects of trade in transforming the economy into a modern market economy. This is done through various initiatives. First, the Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP) recognizes that ICTs have an important role to play in poverty alleviation. Trade and e- commerce are also important in that respect. The telecommunication and postal sector policy statement of 1999 is another initiative. Third, Kenya is a participant in the New Partnership for African Development (NEPAD).

Access to the Intenet is exclusively controlled by ""Jambo Net"", which is a subsidiary of the state-controlled Telkom Kenya. ""Jambo Net"" sells bandwidth to various Internet Services Providers (ISPs). Although more than a hundred ISPs have been licenced by the Communications Commission of Kenya (CCK.) as required, only about 30 are operational. Similarly Telkom Kenya has the exclusive rights for the provision of international Very Small Aperture Terminal (VSAT) facilities. The following statistics gives an indication of the use of e-commerce in Kenya:         -    Teledensity is pegged at 4 lines per 100 people in urban areas and 0.16 rural in areas;         -    Internet access is limited to about 200,000 people out of a population of 30 million;         -    50 per cent of the users are multi-national corporations, international corporations and              NGO'S;         -    Less than 5 per cent of the users are government and educational institutions;         -    There are only about 50,000 e-mail accounts;         -    The number of "".ke""-domains was about 1,700 in 2001;         -    Most websites are run by exporters of products or services, i.e.                         (i)      Tours and Travel         50%                         (ii)     Hotels and Restaurants 20%                         (iii)    Arts and Handicrafts     16%                         (iv)     Agriculture              4%                         (v)      Manufacturing            1%                         (vi)     Shipping                 1%","WTCOMTDM40.pdf","Kenya, Kenya, Communications, Commission, of, Kenya, Kenya, Kenya"

A common policy spanning many different              ministries and government agencies is necessary but currently lacking.         -    adopt a legal framework, possibly based on the UNCITRAL model law. There is as yet              no legal framework covering electronic transactions.         -    develop the telecommunications infrastructure, especially in rural areas where              70 per cent of the population live, but where access to electricity, telephone and financial              services is limited and costs high.","WTCOMTDM40.pdf","Kenya, Kenya, UNCITRAL"
"4130",4130,"174","174.     Kenya is a developing country that relies heavily on import duties to supplement government revenue to meet various development objectives. Out of KShs. 200 000 million collected every year, direct taxes contribute about a quarter while indirect taxes contributes slightly over half of the total revenue. Only import duties and VAT on imports together accounts for a quarter of total government revenue. Since 1997 import duties collected have shown an upward trend, although as from the year 2000 the increase has been marginal. This latter can be attributed to the liberalisation measures being undertaken both at regional and international level and particularly within the COMESA as member states adopt the Free Trade Area.","WTCOMTDM40.pdf","Kenya, COMESA"
"4131",4131,"175","175.     The growth of e-commerce has great potential to expand markets, productivity and competitiveness. The challenge and dilemma for the Government is how to tax the increased revenue arising from e-transactions. On the other hand Kenya's competitive edge is in the agriculture and manufacturing sectors and the priority concern for the Government is rather how to enhance access to the Internet to improve productivity in those sectors rather than how to tax Internet transactions. The major challenges therefore include:         -       enhanced technical and institutional capacity to monitor e-transactions;         -       human resource development;         -       compliance and enforcement, especially in the large informal sector; and         -       improved communications infrastructure.","WTCOMTDM40.pdf","Kenya"

The Government of Kenya recognises the important role that e-commerce can play in trade development and particularly in poverty alleviation and that the country needs to catch up with e- commerce. A national Task Force on e-commerce was therefore established in 1999 with the mandate of enhancing the use of e-commerce. The task force has now been re-constituted and registered as an independent organization: the Nationwide Task Force on E-Commerce (NTFECOM). The initiatives have been strengthened further through the International Trade Centre's (ITC) ""E-Trade Bridge""-Programme for Kenya which is spearheaded by NTFECOM. Through this programme the NTFECOM has been able to identify Kenya's e-commerce strengths and weaknesses and is currently in the process of translating the E-Trade Programme into a policy document for submission to the Government. The Government should then prioritize:     -        policies for facilitating e-trade;     -        telecommunications infrastructure;     -        the legal and regulatory framework;     -        the financial environment;     -        human and institutional capacity building; and     -        the e-commerce support network.

Delegations felt, in conclusion, that there is need to continue the debate and further analytical work including impact studies to get a clearer picture of the implications of e-commerce for the development of developing countries in fulfilment of the Doha Development Agenda. It seems that e- commerce poses both challenges and opportunities to developed and developing country governments and companies alike. The direct effects on government revenue through tariff losses seem to be very small whereas the effects on the efficiency of an economy can be large.

Mr. Chiedu Osakwe, Director, Technical Cooperation Division said that the Secretariat had initiated the process for designing the WTO TA Plan for 2003. 2001 and 2002 were transitional years in WTO technical cooperation. A far-reaching re-organization had been undertaken in 2001 of both the structure of the Technical Cooperation Division and the elaboration of the New Strategy. Post-Doha, in interaction with Members in the CTD, the architecture of the WTO TA Plan had been significantly changed and Members had assisted the Secretariat in designing the 7 pillars of the Secretariat response to the TC mandates in the Doha Ministerial Declaration. However, there had been a considerable rush and the work had been done under pressure. It was the intention of the Secretariat to present a draft TA Plan for 2003 to the CTD after the summer break. To that end, the Secretariat wished to invite Members and Observers to submit their requests for TA for 2003 to the Technical Cooperation Division before the end of July 2002. The requests received would be processed on the basis of consultations with the requesting countries. Requests should include clear indications of venue, for both regional and national activities, and dates. The Secretariat had began early as one of the difficult challenges that the Secretariat had faced in the implementation of earlier TA Plans was inability to plan ahead because of the late receipt of requests. Forward planning would assist the Secretariat, Members and Observers to limit ad hoc requests. While the Secretariat had kept ad hoc requests in the 2002 Plan to a minimum, the intention was to hold it to zero in the 2003 Plan, except in the most exceptional of circumstances. Ad hoc requests had had a damaging effect on WTO TA Plans and had affected implementation and delivery of agreed activities.","WTCOMTDM40.pdf","Chiedu, Osakwe, Director, Technical, Cooperation, Division, Secretariat, WTO, WTO, Technical, Cooperation, Division, Members, CTD, WTO, Members, Secretariat, Secretariat, Secretariat, CTD, Secretariat, Members, Technical, Cooperation, Division, Secretariat, Secretariat, Secretariat, Members, Secretariat, WTO"

The Secretariat would be asking them to inform the Secretariat of any invitations they intended to extend to the WTO Secretariat, asking for resource persons, for their programmes and activities in 2003. The WTO Secretariat needed to immediately plan for them. In the past few years, the Secretariat had received many invitations from other international agencies, both at the multilateral and regional level, inviting the WTO Secretariat to participate by providing resource persons. Most of the programmes and activities of many international organizations were essentially focussed on the work of the WTO. However, many of the invitations were received at the last minute and classified as urgent. The WTO Secretariat treated those invitations as TA as they could not be classified as anything else in the WTO budget. To be able to respond to them, the Secretariat had to plan ahead. Unlike previous years, the Secretariat would not be able to respond positively if it did not plan well in WT/COMTD/M/40 Page 6 advance. Members were invited to provide the Secretariat with any ideas they might have, for improving on the design and the architecture of the WTO TA Plan. He thanked Members for assistance given with the Plan currently under implementation.

Deputy Director General Mr. Ravier said that he wished to say a few words on the recent initiative of the Director-General, as set out in his communication of 4 April 2002 to all Geneva-based ambassadors. That initiative proposed the holding of parallel three-month trade policy courses in English in Nairobi and in French in Rabat. The programme of those courses would be substantially the same as that of the residential courses run by the WTO Training Institute in Geneva. The first series of courses was intended for officials from African countries. Should the experience prove positive, it could be extended to other parts of the world. The project was a joint undertaking with the respective universities of those two cities. The courses would, insofar as it was possible, not be given by WTO officials, but by various experts selected from amongst retired GATT and WTO officials, and among experts proposed by Members in response to an invitation from the Director-General, or from experts put forward by the host institutions or donors within the framework of project financing. He pointed out that the project was an addition to and fell outside both the ""normal"" activities of WTO Training Institute, of which the Committee had already been informed at a previous meeting, and the consolidated technical assistance programme under the Doha Trust Fund. It was an additional, and as yet unfunded, activity. Neither did it replace any other scheduled activities of which Members had been informed.","WTCOMTDM40.pdf","Director, Ravier, Director-General, Nairobi, Rabat, WTO, Training, Institute, Geneva, WTO, GATT, WTO, Members, Director-General, WTO, Training, Institute, Committee, Doha, Trust, Fund, Members"

The representative of the European Communities asked whether the Secretariat could expand on some of the basic parameters of the delivery of TA, in particular with respect to paragraph 2 of the Coordinated WTO Secretariat Annual Technical Assistance Plan 2002, in which the coordination with well-defined inter-agency groups and multilateral agencies was mentioned. At the end of small roman (i) of paragraph 2 there was a commitment to inform the Membership of partnerships under negotiation in the many areas where the WTO was not the best placed to deliver TA. Although there seemed to be progress with regional banks, he asked how contacts with other agencies had evolved as there were many other international organizations or agencies with which the WTO should cooperate. He also requested additional information on the in-house coordination, and especially with respect to how the TAMC had functioned. That information would be useful in ensuring that some of the themes in the plan were being followed up in a manner which met the expectations of the Members.

He agreed that the short time-frame for planning had made it difficult for the Secretariat to include elements of the Doha Development Agenda into the 2002 TA Plan. Advance preparations for the 2003 Plan were welcome and he urged other Members to take advantage of that. Although there were problems with the Integrated Framework (IF), there was the idea to extend it to other countries. He said that his delegation saw a problem with such an extension as the IF still was a pilot scheme. Before a pilot scheme could be extended it had to be ensured that it was effective and working. He therefore asked the Secretariat to explain the future plans in that regard as                                                                                      WT/COMTD/M/40                                                                                              Page 7 the LDCs were getting worried that in an attempt to widen the scope of the IF, its effectiveness might be lost even before it had been perfected.","WTCOMTDM40.pdf","Uganda, WTO, Secretariat, Doha, Development, Agenda, Members, Secretariat, LDCs"

However, she urged that it not be forgotten that situations constantly evolved and that a certain level of flexibility therefore had to be included in all programmes and plans designed. She did not urge for ad-hocism but for some flexibility. There should be a preparedness to respond to the needs of developing countries as those needs became apparent.

He asked whether the Secretariat could consider prolonging the seminars which lasted for less than one week as it was impossible to understand the WTO system in just three days. So short seminars used donor money which could be better spent, and implied lost time for Secretariat staff. The participants would not get a result out of it which corresponded to their needs either. The last seminar in Djibouti had lasted three days with about forty participants. He asked whether these participants really had obtained a knowledge which corresponded to their needs.

That was an innovative initiative which would have large value added. A certain level of expertise in the organization of short-term training courses had been acquired in his country. A successful national seminar had recently been held (15-19 April 2002).

She welcomed the Secretariat's intention to developed the TA Plan for 2003 by the end of 2002. That Plan could hopefully address some concerns raised with respect to the 2002 Plan, such as better country and regional distribution of TA activities and a balancing of the unmet needs from 2002 by including them in the 2003 Plan. She wished to hear more about the proposal for a two-faced training of trade negotiators programme. In light of the dynamism of the negotiations, an intensive first phase of the programme, before the Mexico Ministerial Conference, could provide benefits as the skills acquired could be utilized during the remaining part of the negotiations, in particular after the Mexico Ministerial Conference.","WTCOMTDM40.pdf","Malaysia, WTO, Secretariat, Mexico"

Deputy Director General Mr. Ravier proposed that the Secretariat would make a report to the next meeting of the CTD on cooperation with other international organizations as a number of precise pieces of information could be provided. With respect to internal Secretariat coordination he said that a Technical Cooperation Management Committee (TAMC) had existed for almost a year. The TAMC met once a month and comprised the relevant directors and one representative of each substantive Division as WTO TA activities increasingly were carried out by the substantive divisions and not by the Technical Cooperation Division. Those meetings were productive. As information was WT/COMTD/M/40 Page 8 exchanged, it was a learning process for all involved. It permitted to keep the coordinated character of TA between the activities, information, follow-up, audit and financing of all WTO TA.","WTCOMTDM40.pdf","Director, Ravier, Secretariat, CTD, Secretariat, Technical, Cooperation, Management, Committee, TAMC, TAMC, WTO, Technical, Cooperation, Division, WTO"

"4149",4149,"30","30.     Mr. Chiedu Osakwe, Director, Technical Cooperation Division confirmed that there was no intention to extend the IF beyond the 49 LDCs. That position had been taken by the heads of agencies in paragraph 7 of their Communiqué of 26 February 2002.1 However, there were several non-LDCs which had asked for the model of the IF to be applied to the assistance they received. Those Governments considered that the totality of their trade development needs would be better met by the agencies working jointly on the basis of the IF concept. The agencies were considering applying the concept to other countries. As they had received specific requests in that regard, there was a favourable disposition in the agencies to do so. The reason was also that the Members had asked the agencies to coordinate better, to seek coherence and to be complementary in the way they responded to the priority needs of non LDCs as well as LDCs. It was no question of a simple extension of the IF, nor would the resources of the Trust Fund be applied to non LDCs. What was considered was an extension of the application of the concept.","WTCOMTDM40.pdf","Chiedu, Osakwe, Director, Technical, Cooperation, Division, Members"
"4150",4150,"31","31.      He went on to say that he shared the view that there had to be some flexibility in the delivery of WTO TA, and there would be a certain degree of flexibility. However, flexibility was not another name for ad-hocism. That there would be flexibility did not mean that ad-hoc requests would be accommodated. The CARICOM had approached the Secretariat to readjust by replacing some of the activities earlier suggested by new projects. There was a flood of requests from different organizations to the WTO Secretariat. The WTO Secretariat therefore needed to be rigorous and disciplined in its responses in order to be able to deliver on the commitments made in a manner that would be qualitatively satisfactory. With respect to cooperation with other agencies, he said that the WTO had a good working relationship with several agencies such as UNCTAD, UNEP, ITC, WCO and had an active dialogue with UNIDO, OECD and some others. The challenge was to find appropriate co-financing arrangements. He did not believe that there was any expectation that the WTO would be funding the totality of the costs out of the Doha Development Agenda Trust Fund for activities with other agencies. Discussions with other agencies were ongoing. The issue of the length of seminars had to be looked at in its totality in response to the requests. With respect to the type of activities delivered so far in 2002 he said that they covered all themes in the Plan.","WTCOMTDM40.pdf","WTO, CARICOM, Secretariat, WTO, Secretariat, WTO, Secretariat, WTO, UNCTAD, UNEP, ITC, WCO, UNIDO, OECD, WTO, Doha, Development, Agenda, Trust, Fund"

It was important that the WTO Secretariat responded to the Members-driven agenda in terms of technical cooperation and capacity building. There were a number of observations from the floor pointing to the need to look at the issue of capacity building beyond TA per se. The medium and long term perspectives of capacity building had to be considered in addition to the seminars and workshops which were valuable in the short run.","WTCOMTDM40.pdf","Chairman, Committee, WTO, Secretariat, WTO, Secretariat"

The Chairman said that as many of the technical cooperation activities under the Co-ordinated WTO Secretariat Annual Technical Assistance Plan were financed through a new Global Trust Fund, the Committee on Budget, Finance and Administration (CBFA) and the CTD were jointly responsible for the execution of the Plan and keeping the spending commitments under periodic review.

"4157",4157,"38","38.     Mr.Neil McMillan, Chairman of the CBFA, said that it was worth recalling that at its meeting held on 19-20 December 2001, the General Council had approved the terms of reference of the Doha Development Agenda Global Trust Fund (DDAGTF) contained in the report of the CBFA (WT/BFA/56). In particular, the General Council had approved a target of CHF 15 million for the Doha Development Agenda Global Trust Fund for 2002. Three miles-stones were attached to that amount in terms of the payment of the funds into the WTO Secretariat Bank Account. An amount equivalent to:         -        25 per cent of that target (i.e. CHF 3.75 million) should have been deposited into                  WTO bank account by the end of 2001;         -        75 per cent (i.e. CHF 11.25 million) should have been deposited by the end of March                  2002; and the aim was for         -        100 per cent (i.e. CHF 15 million) to be deposited at the end of June 2002.","WTCOMTDM40.pdf","McMillan, Chairman, CBFA, General, Council, Doha, Development, Agenda, Global, Trust, Fund, General, Council, WTO, Secretariat, Bank, Account, WTO"

In addition, a buffer account of CHF 1 million was created out of the 2000 WTO budget surplus to cover temporary shortfalls in the Trust Fund in case contributions did not keep pace with activities’ expenses. The monitoring of the achievements of those mile-stones were jointly entrusted to the CTD and the Budget Committee. Since then, the CTD had approved the Co-ordinated WTO Secretariat Annual Technical Assistance Plan for 2002 (WT/COMTD/W/95/Rev.3) and the Secretariat had estimated the total cost of that Plan at CHF 17.3 million, after deduction of an ambitious amount of cost sharing (CHF 5 million) with other institutions, including UNCTAD and a number of regional development banks.","WTCOMTDM40.pdf","WTO, Trust, Fund, CTD, Budget, Committee, CTD, WTO, Secretariat, Secretariat, UNCTAD"

"4160",4160,"40","40.      The pledging conference held on 11 March had produced an unprecedented level of pledges from Members2. At that conference, donors had announced pledges totalling CHF 21.2 million to the Trust Fund for 2002 and a further CHF 3.7 million of earmarked contributions. Those figures included transfers of existing funds to the Trust Fund, but not those funds for which the Secretariat had no instructions from Donors to date in terms of a transfer into the Trust Fund. As the decision taken in December 2001 made clear, where such funds can be used to support the new Trust Funds' activities, they would so be used. Thus, there was scope for the use of funds which were heavily earmarked still to support the objectives of the Trust Fund overall. The downside of the otherwise rosy situation was that funds had been slow in reaching the WTO bank account. In March 2002, the Secretariat had to use up to 80 per cent of the buffer account to cover expenses and commitments which it had already been undertaking according to the Plan. The balance of the Trust Fund was back in the black and the buffer account replenished. The 75 per cent target for receipt at the end of March had been missed. The Trust Fund had by the end of March only received CHF 5.3 million of contributions instead of the target level of CHF 11.25 million as mandated in the General Council’s decision. That was against a level of pledges which was almost 50 per cent higher than the target of         2             Document WT/BFA/SPEC/73. WT/COMTD/M/40 Page 10 CHF 15 million initially agreed by Members. According to the General Council Decision, it was for the CTD and the CBFA to closely supervise whether those benchmarks had been met. Furthermore, when contribution receipt targets were manifestly not met, it was for those to bodies to report to the General Council and for them to meet on an urgent basis to discuss the matter. He would therefore convey the same message to the meeting of the General Council on 14 and 15 May 2002. By 17 April 2002, the total new funds had risen to 7.9 billion and further contributions had been received from Ireland and Estonia, which brought the total receipts of the Trust Fund up to CHF 8.4 million. Document WT/BFA/SPEC/73 would be reissued with any further updates for the meeting of the General Council. If there were imminent payments which Members wished to bring to the attention of the Secretariat, not reflected in the document, he encouraged Members to inform the Secretariat.","WTCOMTDM40.pdf","Secretariat, Trust, Fund, Trust, Fund, WTO, Secretariat, General, Council, Members, General, Council, Decision, CTD, CBFA, General, Council, General, Council, Ireland, Estonia, General, Council, Members, Secretariat, Members, Secretariat"
"4161",4161,"41","41.     As a personal final comment he said that the contributions had fallen short of what the Membership collectively had agreed in December 2001 to pay into the account of the Trust Fund. It was understandable that delays occurred in turning pledges into actual payments. However, he recalled that all had agreed when adopting the decision in the General Council to an ambitious set of benchmarks, with the aim of all funds being remitted to the Secretariat by end of June 2002. The reason was that there was a link drawn in the Doha Ministerial Declaration between the availability of TA and the agreement of delegations to deal with the issues set out there. It was therefore important to provide the funds pledged as quickly as possible, to allow the Secretariat to deliver on an ambitious Plan in a short time. Delegations owed it to themselves to provide the means for capacity building so that capacity building could play the positive role in the Doha Development Agenda which was foreseen in the Doha Ministerial Declaration.","WTCOMTDM40.pdf","Trust, Fund, General, Council, Secretariat, Secretariat, Doha, Development, Agenda"

"4165",4165,"45","45.      Deputy Director General Mr. Ravier said that Members would recall that in 2001 the Training Division had been reconstituted as the Training Institute and that its mandate had been considerably extended. That had led to a complex transition period for the Training Institute. In fact, that transition period had continued into the year 2002 to enable the Institute not only to come to terms with the new functions it had been assigned, but also to adapt to the doubling, under the 2002 budget, of the three-month trade policy courses held in Geneva which were its main activity until December 2001. The report before Members covered the year 2001. He said that in his view that report provided a clear presentation of the Training Institute's activities. Nevertheless, he wished to make two further comments with respect to the document which he hoped would assist Members' discussions. First, the Institute had used the second part of 2001 to lay the necessary foundations for the introduction of a number of new activities. That largely unseen groundwork consisted, in particular, of coordinating and harmonizing not only the selection procedures for participants and the arrangements for their stay, but also the training materials and programmes of the various courses. Most of those changes would only become visible in the course of the year 2002. To bring up to date the information contained in the report (document WT/COMTD/W/96), he provided the following details for the current year:                                                                                   WT/COMTD/M/40                                                                                          Page 11    •   4 three-month trade policy courses would be organized in 2002:                 −       the 19th trade policy course (in English) had been completed almost three                         weeks earlier ;                 −       the 20th trade policy course (in Spanish) would begin the following week;                 −       the 21st and 22nd trade policy courses (in English) would take place for the                         first time in parallel in the coming autumn in the new training rooms, which                         would have been fitted out by the end of August.    •   2 three-week WTO induction courses for LDCs would be organized in 2002:                 −       the first course (in English) had been completed over three weeks earlier;                 −       the second course (in French) was scheduled to take place, in November.    •   3 one-week specialized courses on Dispute Settlement (in English with interpretation in French        and Spanish) would be organized in 2002:                 −       the first course had taken place two weeks ago;                 −       the second course would take place at the end of July; and                 −       the third would take place in December.    •   3 WTO induction days would be organized in 2002:                 −       the first induction day had been held in February;                 −       the second would be held in May; and                 −       the third was scheduled for the autumn.    •   A first series of internet-based training courses was due to begin in the coming autumn on the        basis of the results of a pilot scheme.    •   The first phase of a Training-of-trainers project had been launched in the spring, for WTO        officials engaged in technical cooperation or training activities. It was due to be followed at        the end of the year by a second phase designed for officials from developing countries.    •   Various cooperation projects with the academic community would be set up over the course of        the year. To begin with, particular emphasis would be placed on building the capacities of the        African continent.","WTCOMTDM40.pdf","Director, Ravier, Members, Training, Division, Training, Institute, Training, Institute, Institute, Geneva, Members, Training, Institute, Members, Institute, WTO, WTO, WTO"

His second comment concerned coordination between the Training Institute's activities and the technical cooperation activities carried out by other divisions of the Secretariat. He pointed out that a TAMC had been established in June 2001. That body was currently in operation, providing a link between all the Divisions engaged in technical cooperation and training. The activities of the Training Institute WT/COMTD/M/40 Page 12 presented were thus an integral component of the coordinated approach taken by the Secretariat. The WTO Secretariat distinction between technical cooperation and training could appear artificial, especially as the TA activities would be further enriched by training components. However, the current Secretariat structure contained two different Divisions: one Technical Cooperation Division charged with the activities outside Geneva and a Training Institute mainly carrying out the Geneva-based activities. However, there had to be close and constant coordination between the two and the two were under his responsibility.","WTCOMTDM40.pdf","Members, Committee, Training, Institute, Secretariat, Training, Institute, WT/COMTD/M, Secretariat, WTO, Secretariat, Secretariat, Geneva, Training, Institute"

His delegation wished to hear more about progress in that respect. He encouraged the Secretariat to cooperate as closely as possible with the established institutions in the countries concerned who had the specific knowledge required in training when implementing the new training-related activities.

There was an example from the recent training course where, after the training course, there had been a meeting with some representatives and the Commonwealth Secretariat to discuss how the training could apply to their countries. Cooperation with other organizations would provide participants with more in-depth knowledge of the issues covered in the training courses. He encouraged further such cooperation and agreed with the delegation of the European Communities about the usefulness of cooperation between the WTO Secretariat and the academic community, in particular in developing countries, as mentioned in paragraph 13.

Those activities were in the process of being profoundly renewed, diversified and extended. The aim was to have an Institute which could provide a large range of activities in order to respond to Members' varying needs. One of those was the cooperation with universities. That was the fastest growing area of the Training Institute's activities and the area which would develop the most in the near future. One of the reasons for the creation of the more independent Training Institute was to facilitate a deepened cooperation with universities. There were almost daily contacts between the WTO Training Institute and various other training institutions and universities which asked to collaborate with the WTO Training Institute. One of the current tasks of the Training Institute was to see how to build the network with all those institutions.

Mr. Claude Mercier, Director, the WTO Training Institute said that numerous fruitful contacts had been maintained with a large number of academic institutions, both in developed and in developing countries. The Training Institute was in the process of finalizing a strategy as the large number of contacts required adequate responses within the means at the disposal of the Institute. The various parameters that would guide the institute in its contacts with other institutions were being finalized. The main emphasis was on academic institutions in developing and developed countries which had strong collaboration networks of contacts and cooperation with developing countries. The WTO Training Institute had not been able to move faster in that respect as that activity was not funded. It was the only activity which had been left out of the budget and the Doha Development Fund. His small team was doing its best with the means available. It was anticipated that the networking with universities would at some stage overlap with the training of trainers programme. It was unavoidable that links would have be made with established learning institutions as the passing on of knowledge was the basic concept of the training of trainers programme. The university networking would link to activities such as the training of trainers but also to the distance learning Internet-based courses. The second phase of the training of trainers would be a more complex one than the first one. The first step was to train the WTO personnel to improve their training delivery and design capacity. It was in that respect mostly a presentation skills course. Phase two included training officials from governments and possibly universities to become trainers. They should acquire the same presentation skills. However, that presupposed that the ""trainers to be"" already were experts in WTO matters. Phase two was thus both presentation skills training and training in presenting the content of the WTO Agreements in a better way. Instead of the three-day training provided to WTO staff, they would receive a more than two week, or even longer, training. The plan of how to go about the second phase was still under consideration. One decision that had to be taken was whether to bring the participants to Geneva or whether there would be training in the regions or the countries. Another element under consideration was to use the former participants in the regular training programmes who had since been based in capitals. As they already knew much about the WTO, they were ideal trainers. The aim was to have a definitive plan at the end of 2002. The Secretariat would be able to say more about it at the July or October meetings of the Committee. There had been a WT/COMTD/M/40 Page 14 question regarding fellowships and if the WTO would continue to grant them. He was happy to confirm that that was the case as the fellowships came under the regular budget. The regular budget had even provided for an increase in fellowships, in addition to the more stable and sustainable financing. The regular activities did not yet include the recent initiative of the Director-General for regional courses in Nairobi and Rabat. Those were to be financed separately and they had not been included in the regular budget or the Global Trust Fund. There was no change in the policy with respect to the granting of the regular fellowships. Regarding distance learning and the participation in the pilot phase, he said that a group of between 60 and 65 people had been selected from former training course participants and other colleagues in capitals who had offered to help adjust and improve the distance learning programme. An assessment was to be made after the six weeks. It was a new activity and the WTO wished to do it well. The software and the user-friendliness of the material had to be tested. That was why the Institute proceeded with an initial pilot project before it was expanded. The first real course would be launched in the fall of 2002. How to select the participants for that course would have to be decided. However, the number of potential beneficiaries from that kind of activity would be limited only by the number of tutors that could be guaranteed at the WTO, as the programme was based on two-way communication. The participants had to have access to a tutor at the WTO or elsewhere, e.g., professors at a university. Ultimately, all developing countries would be touched by the programme. As to the university networking, a number of ideas had been received following the request by the Director General for places where training could be carried out. There had been responses from Latin America, various parts of Asia, the South Pacific region and central and eastern European countries as well as from Arab countries. The potential was there but the Training Institute had only begun to look at them and what would become the overall policy of networking with universities. At the moment, the main effort was focussed on organizing, at short notice, the two courses in Africa in the summer of 2002. On another matter, he recalled that the second joint course between the WTO Training Institute and the Commonwealth Secretariat had recently been held. It was a special programme of two weeks held at the end of the three-month training course. The participants seemed to have enjoyed the specific, tailor-made programme. Lastly, the question of whether regional organizations would be invited to the courses in Rabat and Nairobi had not yet been considered.","WTCOMTDM40.pdf","Claude, Mercier, Director, WTO, Training, Institute, Training, Institute, Institute, WTO, Training, Institute, Doha, Development, Fund, WTO, WTO, WTO, WTO, Geneva, WTO, Secretariat, Committee, WTO, Director-General, Nairobi, Rabat, Global, Trust, Fund, WTO, Institute, WTO, WTO, Director, Latin, America, Asia, South, Pacific, region, Training, Institute, Africa, WTO, Training, Institute, Commonwealth, Secretariat, Rabat, Nairobi"

Mr. Paul Rolian, Director of the WTO Technical Cooperation Audit said that the CTD had before it in document WT/COMTD/W/97 the first annual report of the Technical Cooperation Audit. The report covered the period from February 2001, when the function had been created, to 31 December 2001. Judging from the repeated references that had been made by Members to the                                                                                    WT/COMTD/M/40                                                                                           Page 15 importance of a system of evaluation for the WTO TA programme, that report responded to a real need that had been identified by Members. He hoped that the report could serve as a basis for discussion and guidance from Members both for future TA activities and for the evaluation thereof. He would confine his introductory remarks to highlighting three main points. The first concerned the context or, the background. The report recalled that the year 2001 had been a year of transition. Not only was it the year in which the evaluation function had been established, in response to Members' clearly expressed desire, but it had also been the year, in October, in which the strategy for WTO TA had been debated and approved in the CTD, giving a new direction to that aspect of the WTO's work. Reflecting those changes, the Technical Cooperation Division had been reorganized and had absorbed the unit dealing with the IF and LDCs. The Training Division had been renamed the Training Institute and given an expanded mandate. A TAMC had been created as had a focal point in each Division, responsible for TA matters. Some 400 TA activities, more than ever before, had been carried out. That was also the year that saw an end to the debate that had not entirely subsided as to whether TA was or was not a core function of the Organization. Certainly, the Doha Development Agenda could leave no doubt that it was. As the report pointed out, those developments were not merely of academic interest. In the absence of agreement on the legitimacy of TA as part of the mandate of the WTO, it would have been difficult to conduct a strategically coherent programme of TA, and even to evaluate it.","WTCOMTDM40.pdf","Paul, Rolian, Director, WTO, Technical, Cooperation, Audit, CTD, Members, WTO, Members, Members, Members, WTO, CTD, WTO, Technical, Cooperation, Division, LDCs, Training, Institute, TAMC, Doha, Development, Agenda, WTO"
"4183",4183,"61","61.      He continued by saying that his second point concerned the question of methodology. From 1999, work had begun on the development of a monitoring and evaluation system for WTO TA, with the assistance of a consultant. That work had been promising but had been abandoned before being completed when the consultant left the Organization. When the TCA had been established, action had therefore been taken to revamp the function of TA monitoring and evaluation. In doing so, due account had been taken of the work that had been carried out prior to February 2001, as had been the high priority given to TA by Members and the TA Strategy adopted by the Committee. The main conceptual work had therefore been the development of a methodology for the evaluation of WTO's TA, to reflect the specific nature of that assistance. He acknowledged the contribution made by the Department for International Development of the UK Government, which had sponsored that work through a dedicated trust fund. The methodology that had been approved by the Director-General was briefly outlined in paragraphs 9 to 14 of the report, but the full methodology, which was in the Director-General's Notice to Staff (OFFICE(02)/40), had been distributed to Members as well. In relation to the methodology, three observations could be made:         (a)     The WTO's TA portfolio consisted of a large number of activities (around 400 in                 2001 and over 500 in 2002) almost exclusively in the form of training and                 capacity-building, which were of short duration and covered a great number of                 different topics, i.e. they were fragmented.         (b)     Because WTO TA was of that nature, the more common forms of evaluation                 methodology had not been found to be entirely relevant. One of the most challenging                 aspects of evaluation in the WTO context was to establish yardsticks for measuring                 long-term impact. The methodology addressed both that aspect and what had been                 called process aspects, for which criteria of success were easier to determine in terms                 of long-term sustainability.         (c)     The resources devoted to evaluation were limited in relation to the number of                 activities that had to be covered. That was why the methodology envisaged a shared                 responsibility between the Technical Cooperation Audit and the providers of TA.                 Inevitably, most of WTO's TA would be the subject of self-evaluation by the                 providers themselves, and the methodology went into some detail in setting out the                 framework for such self-evaluation. The fact of the matter was that without self-                 evaluation, if only the resources of the TCA were to be used, the basis for drawing WT/COMTD/M/40 Page 16                any conclusions about WTO TA would simply be insufficient. The role of TCA                would be inter alia to conduct evaluations on a broader basis, bringing together                information and drawing lessons from the self-evaluations and from its own, more                generic studies.","WTCOMTDM40.pdf","WTO, TA, TCA, Members, TA, Strategy, Committee, WTO, Department, for, International, Development, UK, Director-General, Director-General, Members, WTO, WTO, WTO, Technical, Cooperation, Audit, WTO, TCA, WTO, TCA"
"4184",4184,"62","62.     He went on to say that the third main point that the report drew to the attention of the Committee concerned some of the observations made and the lessons learned during the first year of operation.        (a)     The first of those was that over all, the quality of execution of WTO's TA was high.                It was not just the Auditor who said that; it had been confirmed consistently in                feedback from participants and in consultations with representatives of beneficiary                Members. WTO staff were on top of that aspect of their work, professional in their                approach and dedicated to what they were doing. It was worth recalling in that                connection that most of them were not hired for their skills in delivering TA, and that                in the period under review the pressure on them of competing work priorities                remained high.        (b)     The second observation was that making TA successful called for a cooperative effort                between the WTO Secretariat (providers) and Members (beneficiaries). That                cooperation could take several forms, from purely practical ones – pre-activity                logistics, meeting room arrangements, security, back-office assistance, hospitality,                etc. – to more substantive issues relating, for example, to the selection of participants                in WTO TA activities. Appropriate selection of those who would participate in                training activities meant that those activities would have a greater chance of                producing substantive results than they would otherwise. In a demand- and Member-                driven context, the selection of participants was obviously a matter for Members, but                they could and do enhance the impact of TA activities when they ensured that those                who participated really were concerned in their day-to-day work by the issues under                discussion, and were likely to remain in the trade business. More outreach to sectors                other than government also turned out to be a factor which adds value to TA.        (c)     Third, TCA had observed that there was a need for the Secretariat to continue to                focus on what was termed ""upstream"" activities, namely analysis of the needs of                Members and design of TA. For example, the report made the point that a simple                thing, such as clearly setting out the objective that was being sought in a given                activity or cluster of activities, should be an automatic step in planning for TA. The                identification of needs could rely on more than just the input from Members; TPR                reports, the work of Committees, and cooperation with other agencies might also be                factored in. Thinking about objectives had to begin early in the process of                determining the programme of activities. The DDA and the strategy for TA would be                helpful in that respect.        (d)     Fourth, with regard to sustainability, which was the most difficult aspect to evaluate,                there had been confirmation that the value of TA was enhanced when beneficiaries                recognised that they had more than a passive stake in the process. The success of TA                activities over the longer term would depend on factors such as the following:                (i)     beneficiary governments had national strategies that ensured that participants                        and other stake holders gained maximum benefit from WTO TA;                (ii)    beneficiaries continued with their own capacity-building activities even after                        WTO TA had ended, in order to consolidate and extend the results;                                                                                    WT/COMTD/M/40                                                                                           Page 17                 (iii)   beneficiaries took steps to ensure that WTO TA activities were extended                         beyond the immediate recipients to other government and non-governmental                         actors in the national context.         (e)     Fifth, at almost every TA activity that TCA had attended, remarks had been made                 concerning the fact that the WTO type of assistance addressed only one aspect of the                 trade capacity deficit faced by developing countries, and in particular by LDCs.                 Those remarks echoed those that had been made also in the Committee. Having a                 fuller understanding of the Agreements and rules underpinning the multilateral                 trading system was important, but so was having concretely the possibility of taking                 advantage of the opportunities that were beckoning, or at least overcoming the main                 obstacles to trading more. While TA evaluation had not focussed particularly on that                 aspect, it would be interesting to observe the extent to which, for example, the idea of                 mainstreaming WTO policy into national policy, and the IF programme could                 constitute a response to that concern that was so deeply felt.","WTCOMTDM40.pdf","Committee, WTO, Members, WTO, WTO, Secretariat, Members, WTO, Member, Members, TCA, Secretariat, Members, Members, TPR, DDA, WTO, WTO, WTO, TCA, WTO, Committee, WTO"
"4185",4185,"63","63.      Much had been done in 2002 as well that would have an impact on TA activities; the preparation of an annual plan specifically tied to the Doha Development Agenda, and a pledging conference that had produced commitments almost double those of previous years, would have an impact on TA activities, was would the onset of mandated negotiations. But that was for future reports.","WTCOMTDM40.pdf","Doha, Development, Agenda"
"4186",4186,"64","64.      The representative of Switzerland said that his delegation did not consider the auditing mechanism and such reports as instruments for criticizing those providing TA, but as a means of learning and improving the TA provided. The recommendations of the TCA seemed useful and his delegation expected that they be seriously taken into consideration and that there would be follow-up upon them. Mr. Rolian had provided a comprehensive overview and had outlined the main findings. However, he said that four aspects were of particular importance to his delegation. The first was the need to set clear objectives for the various groups of TA. Close dialogue with the beneficiaries could assist in setting such objectives. As a second point, his delegation would welcome continued efforts in defining the tasks of, and the interface between, the operational divisions and the TC Division. His third point was that the selection of the participants in the different courses was crucial. Increased attention had to be given to that aspect, both by the Secretariat and by the beneficiary countries. It might help to analyze the reason why participants in the Trade Policy Courses seemed to remain longer in the trade area than participants in other courses. Collaboration between the WTO and agencies specialized in networking, such as the International Centre for Sustainable Development (ICSTD), might therefore be helpful. As the fourth point he said that his delegation supported the ideas mentioned in the last chapter of the report under the heading ""Lessons Learned"", although his delegation was aware that they were not easy to implement. However, some reflection on them was worthwhile. That included the suggestion that expanding the duration of the seminars at the expense of reducing the overall number of seminars, would, in the long run, prove beneficial for all. Given the Doha Work Programme and the pressing need for TA related to it, it was probably not something which could be done in 2002 or 2003. Nevertheless, it should be kept in mind for the future.","WTCOMTDM40.pdf","Switzerland, TCA, Rolian, TC, Division, Secretariat, WTO, Doha, Work, Programme"
"4187",4187,"65","65.     The representative of the European Communities said that his delegation was one of those which had underlined the need for more coherence and improved evaluation of WTO TC. It was not a coincidence that one of the European Communities' Member States had taken the initiative to pay for much of the preliminary work of the Technical Cooperation Audit. His delegation therefore remained attached to that exercise. He noted that the basis for the audit had been nine projects and forty back-to-office reports. His delegation would appreciate it if the basis would be broader the second time. However, it was a good start. A more in depth analysis of some of the issues involved would be helpful in the next report. For example, paragraphs 17 and 21 dealt with the important question of demand-drivenness and objectives. His delegation found it worrying that paragraph 17 stated that WT/COMTD/M/40 Page 18 ""Members are on the whole receptive to discussing with the Secretariat priority areas and other details based on the Secretariat's experience"". That did not correspond to his delegation's mainstreaming dogma which was firmly established and which stipulated that measures planned and objectives set should be part of the overall development strategies of the beneficiaries. His delegation would be pleased if more could be done to deepen that important preliminary step before other measures were taken. The question of sustainability had been highlighted by other delegation. It would be a key point to follow up on to see how difficult it might be to measure success, track the impact and see how WTO TA could be improved. More than ever after the Doha Ministerial Conference and the commitments made there, Members were under pressure to live up to the TA commitments made and had to ensure that the activities were effective. The report of the TCA would help delegations answer the question whether the TC provided had been effective or not. He therefore encouraged the Secretariat to continue on the chosen track.","WTCOMTDM40.pdf","European, Communities, WTO, TC, European, Communities, Member, Technical, Cooperation, Audit, Members, Secretariat, Secretariat, WTO, Doha, Ministerial, Conference, Members, TA, TCA, Secretariat"

The Chairman said that in paragraph 1.1 of the Decision on Implementation-Related Issues and Concerns (WT/MIN(01)17), Ministers had reaffirmed that:          ""… Article XVIII of the GATT 1994 is a special and differential treatment provision         for developing countries and that recourse to it should be less onerous than to         Article XII of the GATT 1994."" The need to revisit Article XVIII was originally recognized in tiret three of Job(01)/152/Rev.1 of 27 October 2001 which stated that:         ""A complete review of Article XVIII shall be undertaken with a view to ensure that it         subserves the original objective of facilitating the progressive development of         economies in developing countries and to allow them to implement programmes and         policies of economic development designed to raise the general standard of living of         their people.""

He said that it was his understanding that the Committee on Balance-of-Payments was considering section B of Article XVIII and would report to the General Council at the end of the year 2002.

She wished the Secretariat to comment, in view of the terms-of-reference of the CTD, on whether issues related to governmental assistance to economic development, which was the title of Article XVIII, were to be dealt with in the CTD. Her delegation observed that sections A and C of Article XVIII, and Section 4(a) specifically, were limited to economies which could only support low standards of living and were in the early states of development. That meant that Article XVIII was a development provision.

Donors had kept their word to commit themselves to provide predictable funding. It was also important to highlight the role that the Conference had had in facilitating a policy dialogue among Members and multilateral agencies to better coordinate their technical cooperation activities with the mandates from the Doha Development Agenda. A full report had been circulated in document WT/COMTD/37. The Pledging Conference held in March 2002 was the first of its kind. It would be an annual event in the future.

A special session of the CTD had been created to deal with issues related to special and differential treatment. Special and differential treatment was a matter for the CTD.

Mr. Patrick Low, Director of the Development and Economic Research Division said that, the International Conference on Financing for Development had been held on 18-22 March 2002 in Monterrey, Mexico, where the ""Monterrey Consensus"" had been adopted. The Monterrey Conference had marked the first quadri-partite exchange of views between governments, civil society, the business community, and institutional stakeholders on global economic issues, and key financial and development issues. The Monterrey Concensus document, addressed six main themes: (i) domestic resource mobilization in developing countries; (ii) the role of private capital flows; (iii) the role of trade; (iv) international development cooperation, including the role of Official Development Assistance (ODA); (v) debt; and (vi) ""systemic issues"" relating to the framework of international cooperation on economic, financial and developmental questions. The document highlighted the importance of trade and recognized that in many cases, trade was ""the single most important external source of development financing"". The statement by the Director-General to the conference, which spelt out his views on the importance of trade in a broader development context, had been made available on the WTO website. In a section of the Monterrey Consensus document entitled ""Staying Engaged"", all stakeholders had been urged to participate actively in the follow-up to the Conference. The discussions at the Conference on poverty reduction, development and coherence were being seen as part of a process which started with the UN Millennium Summit, had been advanced by the WTO Doha Ministerial Decisions, and was to be continued with the World Summit on Sustainable Development, scheduled to be held in Johannesburg, South Africa, in late August/early September 2002. The Sustainable Development Summit, was also being seen by some as an opportunity to have an early stock-taking of the results of the Monterrey Conference and effectiveness in carrying out the operational aspects of the Monterrey Consensus. Additional information on the Conference, including the text of the Monterrey Consensus, the Plenary sessions, the twelve Roundtables and the various side-events might be found at the web-site address www.un.org/esa/ffd.","WTCOMTDM40.pdf","Patrick, Low, Director, Development, and, Economic, Research, Division, International, Conference, on, Financing, for, Development, Monterrey, Mexico, Monterrey, Monterrey, Conference, Monterrey, ODA, Director-General, WTO, Monterrey, UN, WTO, Doha, Ministerial, Decisions, Johannesburg, South, Africa, Monterrey, Monterrey"

The Chairman said that Paragraph 51 of the Doha Ministerial Declaration stated that:         ""The Committee on Trade and Development and the Committee on Trade and         Environment shall, within their respective mandates, each act as a forum to identify         and debate developmental and environmental aspects of the negotiations, in order to         help achieve the objective of having sustainable development appropriately         reflected."" The Committee on Trade and Environment (CTE) had already decided to keep paragraph 51 as a standing item on the Agenda. At the last regular session of the CTE, delegations had had the opportunity to come forward with ideas as to how to approach the issue. It had then been suggested that the CTE have a first exchange of views on the matter at its October 2002 meeting. Some delegations had indicated that they considered it premature to discuss Paragraph 51 at the current stage of the negotiations. Further informal consultations would be held in the CTE. The CTD also had to deal with the subject, in accordance with the decision in paragraph 51. He sought Members' views on how they wished to proceed with that directive from Ministers.","WTCOMTDM40.pdf","Chairman, Committee, on, Trade, and, Development, Committee, on, Trade, and, Environment, Committee, on, Trade, and, Environment, CTE, CTE, CTE, CTD, Members"
"4214",4214,"9","9.       His second point concerned the implementation of the 2002 Technical Assistance Plan. Implementation of the Plan was progressing at a reasonable rhythm even if it was somewhat slower than the Secretariat wished. As of 25 April 2002, a total of 150 activities had been undertaken, totalling 23 per cent of planned activities. That was somewhat below the expected rate as the date of 25 April corresponded to approximately one third of the year. However, with the filling of the WTO Secretariat positions opened in the L-series which would be recruited according to a fast-track procedure, the Secretariat would be able to step up the delivery of TA activities in the second half of the year and be better equipped to meet the ambitious targets established in the 2002 TA Plan. The Secretariat had been invited by Members in the Negotiating Group on Non-Agricultural Market Access, and the Working Group on Trade and Investment to report on TA activities underway and those envisaged, and how they would contribute to the ongoing negotiations and the different work programmes. Members of those bodies had expressed a reasonable degree of satisfaction with WTO TA. The rate of implementation was critically dependent on the extent to which beneficiary countries provide fixed, reliable dates for activities to be delivered in their countries. Frequently, dates were not given on time, and scheduled dates were moved, dislocating the timely delivery of planned activities.","WTCOMTDM40.pdf","Secretariat, WTO, Secretariat, Secretariat, Secretariat, Members, Working, Group, on, Trade, and, Investment, Members, WTO"
"4215",4215,"90","90.      The representative of the European Communities said that he wished to present some preliminary ideas of how to deal with paragraph 51 and he encouraged other delegations to consider the issue. His delegation believed that it was a potentially useful paragraph in the Doha Development WT/COMTD/M/40 Page 22 Agenda as it would allow delegations to have focussed debates on one of the main overall objectives of the Doha Development Agenda. The question was where to start and how to make the work systematic and useful. His delegation had presented some ideas in the CTE. Those ideas had not been very structured and might have been too ambitious. The first reaction from other delegations had been to go slow and to think about them further. What his delegation wished to discuss was the idea of starting off modestly by providing a basis for how work could proceed. That had led his delegation to realize that if any delegate was asked how far the work on the development dimension of the Doha Ministerial Declaration had progressed, it would be difficult to respond. That delegate would have to ask his colleagues dealing with other bodies what they were doing in their respective bodies, under what items they spoke about development, and how work was progressing. Because of that difficulty his delegation suggested some kind of a tracking exercise or all comprehensive exercise to identify progress in various bodies, focalised and centralised in the CTD. Some sort of score board or document that the WTO Secretariat would collect in interaction with the various bodies. A state of play to regularly monitor what happened with respect to development in other bodies. It would be one single paper which would regularly be updated which showed what actually was going on with respect to development, containing short paragraphs of what happened with respect to the IF, TA, S&D, the Working Group on Trade, Debt and Finance, Transfer of Technology, Small Economies, and the Sub-Committee on LDCs for example. This paper did not have to be very detailed but should allow delegations to see the ongoing work in a comprehensive way. He asked other delegations whether they thought that it would be useful for the CTD to ask the Secretariat to consider and explore the idea and suggest the approach to be taken. His delegation believed that it would allow delegations to be more specific and to identify themes for focussed discussions on individual items when it became clear how and where progress was being made. That exercise might also be useful for providing the public at large with an idea of what happened with respect to development in the WTO. The round was called the Doha Development Agenda and delegations had to be able to respond to the question of what progress was being made with respect to development. His delegation's proposal was meant to be a tool to assist in that respect by providing a concise assessment through a continuous tracking exercise throughout the negotiations and during the execution of work programmes. Without asking for an immediate decision, he asked for other delegations' reactions.","WTCOMTDM40.pdf","European, Communities, Doha, Development, Agenda, CTD, WTO, Secretariat, TA, S&D, Working, Group, on, Trade, CTD, Secretariat, WTO, Doha, Development, Agenda"

"4241",4241,"104","104.     The representative of the United States said that the type of analysis provided by the Secretariat in preparing the document WT/COMTD/W/100, helped inform Members' discussions and provided useful insight. One aspect of the report that her delegation found not worthy was that countries that diversified into higher technology sectors, from exporting only primary products, had increased their participation in global trade in the longer term. According to the WTO Secretariat Report, world exports were correlated with the level of technology. The highest growth rates were recorded in the high technology category, accounting for more than a quarter of world exports in the year 2000. The lowest overall growth rate of 3.2 per cent was recorded in primary products. Her delegation particularly appreciated the fact that the Secretariat had provided both regional and country level analysis to reflect the wide range of participation of Members. Among the points highlighted was the fact that some Members had had greater success in increasing their participation in the trading system than others. The report also highlighted the well known success of Asian economies such as China; Hong Kong, China; Chinese, Taipei; The Republic of Korea and Singapore; and their increasing share in global trade. China had become the fourth largest trader in the world. In addition, there were other regions that had experienced some growth in trade. The Secretariat report also mentioned dynamic exporters including                                                                                    WT/COMTD/M/41                                                                                           Page 25 some Members from other geographic regions whose merchandise exports had increased by more than 10 per cent annually. In future reports, her delegation would be interested to learn more from the Secretariat and Members about other relevant factors, domestic and others, that assisted countries in increasing their participation in the global trading system.","WTCOMTDM41.pdf","United, States, Secretariat, Members, WTO, Secretariat, Secretariat, Members, Members, China, Hong, Kong, China, Taipei, The, Republic, of, Korea, Singapore, China, Secretariat, Members, Secretariat, Members"
"4242",4242,"105","105.     The representative of Paraguay said that document WT/COMTD/W/100 contrasted to the report presented by UNCTAD and that WTO Members therefore could reflect upon both documents. His delegation found the document useful with respect to the information it contained on the trends, evolution and increase in the industrial production of developing countries as well as their exports of industrial products. His delegation also noted a slight improvement in some regions or in some countries. He requested that the Secretariat carry out a more detailed analysis with respect to the participation of developing countries, in referring specifically, for example, to a region such as Latin America which contained both giant industrial countries and other less industrially developed countries. The information did not reflect the realities of all countries in one region when the two types of countries were merged into one regional image. His delegation asked the Secretariat to issue a revision of the document providing a breakdown of the information by region, including for example more details on the Asian, African, Latin American and Caribbean regions.","WTCOMTDM41.pdf","Paraguay, UNCTAD, WTO, Members, Secretariat, Latin, America, Secretariat, Caribbean"
"4243",4243,"106","106.    The representative of the European Communities said that Members might have to revert back to the document (WT/COMTD/W/100) at the next meeting as delegations would then have had more time to study it. His delegation found the document interesting and some of the trends that had been identified might warrant an in depth discussion. The representative of the United States had already alluded to some of them when mentioning the relationship between high technology and commodity exports, the problem of commodity prices, the disparities among developing countries and the value of regional integration. He said that Charts 1 to 4 of the Annex were intriguing in showing the progress that some countries had made in reducing their dependency on primary products, while others had not been able to do so. If that was coupled with the actual growth of GDP or exports it would probably be more significant. His delegation looked forward to a deeper discussion along the themes he had just indicated.","WTCOMTDM41.pdf","European, Communities, Members, United, States"

The Chairman said that when he first had seen document WT/COMTD/W/100, he had felt that it required serious consideration and deep examination and that Members would not have enough time to react to it at that meeting.

One was the submission by the European Communities contained in multi-symbol document WT/COMTD/W/99 – WT/CTE/W/208 - TN/TE/W/3 and the other was the overall question of how the CTD should proceed with work on the agenda item. He suggested that Members treat those sub-items simultaneously.","WTCOMTDM41.pdf","Chairman, European, Communities, CTD, Members"
"4246",4246,"109","109.    The representative of the European Communities said that the main purpose of submitting that document was to ensure that Members were aware that it existed. His delegation believed that Members needed to seriously consider what was in the Doha Ministerial Declaration about WT/COMTD/M/41 Page 26 encouraging voluntary sustainability impact assessment. To be precise on what that could mean, his delegation had provided two documents, one was on the methodology that had been used by the European Communities. The methodology was important in terms of the type of assessment in question. The second part provided an example of how an assessment could be done, considering some sectors and some products. He urged Members to read the introductions as well as the methodologies and case studies, as they would give an idea of what his delegation was doing. Further information was available on the website http://idpm.man.ac.uk/sia-trade as indicated in the covering letter in WT/COMTD/W/99 – WT/CTE/W/208 - TN/TE/W/3. The studies and especially with respect to the question of major crops, warranted a closer look. He urged Members to look at that in order to see whether they also considered it an interesting exercise. His delegation was in favour of more work on paragraph 51. He referred to the minutes of the last meeting where Members had set the ideas of a tracking exercise in the CTD. His delegation had listened to the reactions in the informal meeting and still believed that it would be useful to have some kind of comprehensive overview, in one document, which would allow Members to see where they were on the ""Development"" part of the DDA agenda.","WTCOMTDM41.pdf","European, Communities, Members, Members, Members, Members, Members, CTD, Members, DDA"

Her delegation's support for the DDAGTF was in addition to the AITIC contribution of AUD500,000 and the successful delivery of a trade policy training course for African trade negotiators which was run in cooperation with the Government of South Africa in May 2002. That training course was delivered to 25 participants from 16 African countries including seven LDCs and two WTO non-resident Members. Her Government would provide AUD25 million of trade-related technical assistance during the 2002-2003 financial year. Overall, her delegation was pleased with the implementation of the 2002 Technical Assistance Plan including the advanced training courses for Government Officials and activities of the WTO Training Institute. Her delegation commended the Secretariat on the transparency of its reporting process. She trusted that the ongoing reporting provided would assist the Secretariat and the Membership to fine tune the 2003 Plan, thereby allowing the WTO technical assistance strategy to be continually improved. Her delegation was especially appreciative of the work being done with other organizations, particularly the regional development banks. She requested information on three points so as to clarify the situation and to possibly identify areas where Members could make a contribution to the process. Those included the types of assistance being provided on an ad-hoc basis, the level of response to the call for requests for technical assistance in 2003, and the issues that the WTO was having problems resolving with other agencies. It was in the interest of all WTO Members to make the technical assistance strategy as effective and efficient as possible. Her delegation would be happy to look at ways of making that possible, including through action in other organizations.","WTCOMTDM41.pdf","Australia, Committee, South, Africa, WTO, Members, WTO, Training, Institute, Secretariat, Secretariat, WTO, Members, WTO, WTO, Members"

He said that his delegation had concerns with respect to some of the aspects of the document. There was no mention of the impact of rural development in developing countries, and the way in which the high level of subsidies in some developed countries could disturb investment flows in rural zones of developing countries and the poorest zones of those countries. His delegation had expressed its non-trade concerns about the lack of trade liberalization in agriculture in CTE document (WT/CTE/W/138). It had also been presented in the first stage of the negotiations in agriculture (under document symbol G/AG/NG/W/88). Another concern was the lack of any mention of the dependence caused by food export subsidies on which the MERCOSUR and other Members had presented a document (G/AG/NG/W/38) under phase 1. His delegation noted that there were some omissions in the document WT/COMTD/W/99 – WT/CTE/W/208 - TN/TE/W/3 and it would continue studying the submission.","WTCOMTDM41.pdf","Argentina, CTD, MERCOSUR, Members"

His delegation would have to look at the document (WT/COMTD/W/99 – WT/CTE/W/208 - TN/TE/W/3) in greater detail. There were some elements that were inherent to constraints of the study, as the paper itself recognised. Some elements, as stated by the representative of Argentina, had not been included in the analysis and there were some indications which pointed to certain concerns as to how the methodology had been developed.","WTCOMTDM41.pdf","Chile, Argentina"
"4251",4251,"113","113.     The representative of the European Communities clarified that the question of subsidies was part of scenario number three, the liberalization scenario, which was based on the assumption that all forms of export subsidies, domestic support measures, and import duties would be abolished. The effects on rural development were also taken into account. The first paragraph on page 21 of his delegation's submission considered the issue of rural women in the agricultural sector. The third paragraph considered small-scale farmers and the rural poor in general. He said that he would not go into that in more detail, but he wished to ensure that all the elements had been put on the table.

It had been decided that open-ended informal consultations be held on item H, including a proposal that had been made by the delegation of the European Communities for a process of tracking the developmental aspects of the negotiations and other WTO work. Those informal consultations had been held and it was clear that delegations required more time to consider all aspects of the topic, and needed time to react to the proposal made by the delegation of the European Communities. He had enquired at that Meeting if delegates felt that it would be fruitful to continue the informal consultations. Some delegations had expressed support for continuing the informal consultations. A few delegations had said that they wished to examine document WT/COMTD/W/99 – WT/CTE/W/208 - TN/TE/W/3 further. He also understood that the delegations which had not had the chance to consider it wished for an opportunity to do so.

He had concluded from those consultations that there had been no objection to deal with Article XVIII, apart from section B relating to balance-of-payments, as an outstanding implementation issue in the regular sessions of the CTD as long as it was without prejudice to work related to Article XVIII carried out elsewhere. The questions before the CTD were firstly, how it should deal with Article XVIII, excluding Section B, as an outstanding implementation issue; secondly, what delegations wished to get out of the consideration of it; and thirdly, what the goal with the reporting in December should be.","WTCOMTDM41.pdf","Chairman, CTD, CTD"
"4255",4255,"117","117.     The representative of India said that the implementation-related issues and concerns regarding the various WTO agreements had been raised by some developing countries in the run up to the Seattle and Doha Ministerial Conferences. Decisions on certain implementation concerns had been reached at the Doha Ministerial Conference, which were contained in the Doha Decision on Implementation-Related Issues and Concerns (WT/MIN(01)/17). Some implementation-related concerns remained outstanding and needed to be dealt with as per paragraph 12 of the Doha Ministerial Declaration. Paragraph 12(b) of the Doha Ministerial Declaration stated that ""the other outstanding implementation issues shall be addressed as a matter of priority by the relevant WTO bodies, which shall report to the Trade Negotiations Committee, established under paragraph 46 below, by the end of 2002 for appropriate action."" Ministers had agreed that negotiations on outstanding implementation issues should be an integral part of the work programme. Accordingly, her delegation drew Members attention to its earlier proposal on Article XVIII, sections A and C of GATT 1994 as contained in document WT/GC/W/363 dated 12 October 1999. She recalled that Article XVIII recognised the need for Members to take protective or other measures affecting imports in order to implement programmes and policies of economic development with the objective of raising the general standard of living. In that endeavour, additional facilities would be provided to enable them, inter alia, ""to maintain sufficient flexibility in their tariff structure to be able to grant the tariff protection required for the establishment of a particular industry"" and to take other specific measures effecting imports envisaged in Section C in the process of economic development. Article XVIII, sections A and C, also specified the procedure to be followed by a Member wishing to promote the establishment of a particular industry with a view to raising the general standard of living of its people. The underlying intention of those provisions was based on the recognition that WT/COMTD/M/41 Page 28 Members with limited resources might not, at all times, be able to rely exclusively on WTO consistent measures to deal with issues arising from the implementation of their programmes of economic development. While WTO Members, acting jointly, could under specific circumstances release the concerned Member from its obligations under the WTO Agreement to the extent necessary to apply that measure, the obligation of having to make additional concessions or face temporary suspension by other WTO Members of a substantially equivalent concession on account of an impairment due to the introduction of the measure in question, actually nullified the very intention of allowing developing countries to promote industrial development.","WTCOMTDM41.pdf","India, WTO, Seattle, Doha, Ministerial, Conferences, WTO, Trade, Negotiations, Committee, Members, GATT, Members, Member, Members, WTO, WTO, Members, Member, WTO, WTO, Members"
"4256",4256,"118","118.     She went on to say that her delegation's proposal (in document WT/GC/W/363) sought to ensure that for the purposes of paragraph 7(b) and 18(b) of Article XVIII, as the case might be, it should be sufficient for WTO Members, acting jointly, to concur in the proposed measure if they were satisfied that all reasonable efforts had been made by the concerned Member to reach an agreement with any relevant Member, without having to face the prospect of suspension of equivalent concession and/or retaliation. The mandate before the CTD was to conduct a complete review of Article XVIII, with the view to ensure that it served the original objective of facilitating the progressive development of economies in developing countries, and to allow them to implement the programmes and policies of economic development designed to raise the general living standards of their people. The proposal that she had outlined drew upon one set of issues in that context. Her delegation had also noted the proposals by the delegation of Saint Lucia (TN/CTD/W/8). Her delegation had in particular noted the need to clarify certain procedural ambiguities in Article XVIII:C, the need to interpret broadly the circumstances involving ""infant industries"" read along with the Addendum note to paragraphs 2, 3, 7, 13 and 22 of Article XVIII and the need to reconsider the concept of compensation and/or retaliation in order to make the provisions of Article XVIII effective, as well as to facilitate the implementation of sustainable economic development programmes in developing member countries. While the delegation of Saint Lucia had made those proposals in the Special Session of the CTD, her delegation had been working on similar issues. She hoped to concretize similar aspects related to the development of industries in developing members in the context of the current work in the regular sessions of the CTD and under implementation-related issues in the near future.","WTCOMTDM41.pdf","WTO, Members, Member, Member, CTD, Saint, Lucia, Saint, Lucia, CTD, CTD"
"4257",4257,"119","119.    The representative of the United States reiterated that her delegation did not oppose dealing with Article XVIII in the CTD as long as it was clear that the CTD was handling over-arching aspects of the proposals and that its work was without prejudice to any view on which the WTO body would handle Article XVIII invocations. Her delegation believed that there was precedence in the BOP's Committee concerning Article XVIII:B and in the Council for Trade in Goods concerning Article XVIII:C. She asked if the delegation of India could make its statement available so that delegations could examine its details more carefully.3 It was faxed to all delegations on 10 July 2002. Her delegation was not persuaded that, at that time, a review of Article XVIII:A and C was warranted. However, her delegation was still prepared to listen and reflect on any views expressed, in light of what the representative of India had said. Members had spent a considerable amount of time on some of the issues before they had reached that stage and were now fulfilling the mandate of the Doha Implementation-Related Issues and Concerns. Her delegation's reflection would also be related to its concern with the implications of the proposal. The phrase ""with a view to ensure"" in Job 152 was particularly problematic to her delegation. Initiating a review based on past discussions would be of concern, especially when that would weaken existing obligations or predetermine the outcome.","WTCOMTDM41.pdf","United, States, CTD, CTD, WTO, BOP, Committee, India, India, Members, Doha"

The representative of Sri Lanka said that her delegation supported the statement made by the representative of India regarding Article XVIII and that a review needed to be undertaken. Her delegation believed it was the right time to undertake that review since Members were going to engage in negotiations both for the liberalization in the agricultural and non-agricultural sectors. Developing countries would be able to understand how they could exercise the flexibilities provided         3             It was faxed to all delegations on 10 July 2002.

At the Special Session of the CTD, her delegation had highlighted that there was a lack of coherence in the WTO Agreements and had requested the Special Session to look into the issue of coherence in the architecture of those agreements. She said that was something that would be of relevance to the CTD in regular session. Her delegation believed that the proposal by the delegation of India would guide the CTD to the solutions that Members needed to look for in relation to that implementation issue.","WTCOMTDM41.pdf","Sri, Lanka, India, Members, GATT, WTO, CTD, WTO, CTD, India, CTD, Members"

Views had been expressed of how difficult that would be and he asked the Secretariat to inform Members about its efforts. He said that he raised that issue because he found it difficult to engage in a debate on the virtues of lowering some of the barriers or, as the delegation of India might say, ""loosening the strait jacket of Article XVIII"", because Members were still not certain how it would work and whether there were cases where it had already been used. He suggested that the minutes of the meeting should contain some answers on the experience which was available. It would be difficult for Members to have a hypothetical discussion without case studies, where for example, there was no possibility for Members to ask for concessions elsewhere or suspend concessions. His delegation's concern was that if Members were not aware of how that would operate, they might be creating a bigger loophole than even the proponents might want. He asked other delegations to reflect on how Members could make progress on that issue, and in particular whether they had experience of cases where the protection of an infant industry was not possible because of the restraints of Article XVIII.","WTCOMTDM41.pdf","European, Communities, CTD, Secretariat, Secretariat, Members, India, Members, Members, Members, Members, Members"

That report was a useful source of information on the revenue implications of e-commerce.

"4264",4264,"125","125.    The representative of Pakistan said that his delegation attached great importance to the aspect of e-commerce in the work programme of the CTD. Most developing countries had little or no national experience, expertise or technical capacity in the field of e-commerce and thus had not fully analysed the possible and often unpredictable implications of its development in their economies and their societies. His delegation understood that in the present day world, e-commerce presented opportunities. However, it posed many threats to the economies of the developing countries and the LDCs along with those opportunities. In a world of a digital divide between the North and the South, there were many aspects of that particular mode of commerce which needed to be examined. In one WT/COMTD/M/41 Page 30 of the publications appearing in the International Herald Tribune, the Director General of the WTO had said that ""there are more internet connections in Singapore alone than that in all of Africa"". If the scenario was that two-thirds of humanity did not even have access to e-commerce, it seemed unjust and unfair to be talking about globalisation with respect to e-commerce. In that regard, his delegation was pleased with the work done by the CTD and hoped that the CTD would be able to examine issues in more depth and come up with concrete suggestions to the General Council which would lead to meaningful results. Though there was little doubt that e-commerce was an important issue for world trade, there were several aspects of it that needed to be further studied, especially from the point of view of its implications for the developing world. There were several impediments to the availability of and access to that medium in developing countries and unless those were addressed, the gap between the North and South and that between the poor and the rich would only widen. His delegation therefore suggested that the Committee deal with the issues of infrastructure, investment, availability of hardware and software, awareness, education and training when considering e- commerce. Developing countries needed to be given adequate time to thoroughly study the implications and the optimal ways of placing the internet and e-commerce in the service of development. The granting of S&D for developing countries with reference to the infrastructure development had to be duly considered by the CTD.","WTCOMTDM41.pdf","Pakistan, CTD, South, International, Herald, Tribune, Director, WTO, Singapore, Africa, CTD, CTD, General, Council, North, Committee, CTD"
"4265",4265,"126","126.     He continued by saying that as regards the issue of transfer of technology, one of the major barriers to the interests of developing countries was the non-availability of encryption technology. Developing countries faced special challenges and responsibilities to create a conducive policy environment that, on the one hand allowed for the development of e-commerce, and on the other ensured the social objective of providing access and benefits for those that could not afford it. If developing countries were to benefit from the new technological and economic boom which the growth of e-commerce represented, they would need to get access to technology and develop their infrastructure. His delegation reminded the CTD about the concerns raised by the developing countries regarding the non-operationlization of Article IV of the GATS. Article IV provided for the participation of developing countries, through enhanced market access in areas of export interest to them, and through better access to technology, including encryption technology and security of transactions and efficient telecommunication services. The existing restrictions on the export of state- of-the-art encryption technology by some Members was of particular concern to his delegation. The striking disparity between the developed and developing countries' capacity to engage in e-commerce, especially in terms of the infrastructure that was required, had to be central to Members' discussions. To address that disadvantage and to ensure a level playing field, a package of measures would have to be considered. That package could include access to, and transfer of, related technology such as the sharing of encryption and security technology to allow secure transactions. In addition mechanisms that facilitated the ability of developing country firms to engage in e-commerce were necessary. In that regard, there was a need for subsidized access to e-markets and assistance in the establishment of banking systems for all types of e-commerce transactions. He concluded by saying that standards related to various aspects of e-commerce should be formulated with the effective participation of developing countries. Such standards should not be complex and onerous to observe as that would act as a barrier to entry of developing country firms into e-commerce.","WTCOMTDM41.pdf","CTD, Members, Members"

"4268",4268,"129","129.     The representative of Canada said that on 27 June 2002, the Canadian Prime Minister, Jean Chrétien had announced initiatives that her Government would take to support Africa's development, including enhanced market access, trade and investment, resources for good government, conflict prevention, education, health, agricultural research and water management. The announcements represented a commitment of Canadian $6 billion in new and existing resources over five years to Africa's development, including a Canadian $5 million Canada Fund for Africa that had been previously announced. The new initiatives would bring together governments, the private sector and civil society to promote African initiative, human development and critical infrastructure services. They would include public participation and capacity-building to develop African solutions to its challenges and were in complete alignment with the NEPAD and the G8 Africa Action Plan. There would be a Canadian $100 million programme to encourage private sector investment by creating an African investment fund which would support and leverage private sector resources for investment in infrastructure such as roads, water supply and pipeline construction. Canadian $20 million would be set aside for three new initiatives to increase Africa's trade capacity by working to promote exports within and outside Africa and to strengthen the role of African countries and institutions in the multilateral trading system. Those included Canadian $7 million, over three years to further the JITAP programme, $8 million over three years, to the ITC and the Trade Facilitation Office of Canada for a creative new programme of export promotion, and $5 million over three years to develop a trade policy expertise centre for Africa in partnership with the Economic Commission for Africa. There would also be Canadian $35 million for three initiatives to help bridge the digital divide by supporting African initiatives that expanded the use and benefits of new information and communications technologies.","WTCOMTDM41.pdf","Canada, Jean, Chrétien, Africa, Africa, Canada, Fund, for, Africa, Africa, Africa, ITC, Trade, Facilitation, Office, of, Canada, Africa, Economic, Commission, for, Africa"

He said that the content of Mr. Ravier's presentation was available in two conference documents with the symbol CRP/1 for technical cooperation and CRP/2 for training activities. He reiterated that the item on training dealt not only with the activities of the WTO Training Institute but all WTO training activities.","WTCOMTDM41.pdf","Chairman, Director-General, Ravier, Ravier, WTO, Training, Institute, WTO"
"4270",4270,"130","130.    Another representative of Canada said that on 27 June 2002, Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chrétien announced that, effective from 1 January 2003, Canada would provide duty free and quota free access to imports from 48 of the world's LDCs for all products except dairy products, poultry and eggs. That action was being taken to help LDCs develop by increasing their opportunities to trade and by encouraging investment in those countries. His Government had received direct representations from LDCs to provide improved market access. A number of international organizations, including the WTO, IMF, the World Bank and the UN, had noted the benefits of granting greater market access to LDCs. Canada's LDC market-access initiative covered the major products of interest which those LDCs exported to Canada, including apparel which accounted for more than half of Canada's imports from LDCs. His Government was also developing new rules of origin and rules of origin procedures for textiles and apparel for those preferences. Those rules of origin were designed:                 (i)     to provide real opportunities and benefits that LDCs could realize by directly                         taking into account the production capacity of LDCs;                 (ii)    by allowing for accumulation, they extend benefits to developing countries,                         as well as LDCs, who produced inputs, such as yarn and fabric, that was used                         by LDCs to produce apparel and other finished textile products; and                 (iii)   to ensure that the benefits went to where they were intended while protecting                         against illegal transhipment and without imposing undue administrative                         burdens.","WTCOMTDM41.pdf","Canada, Jean, Chrétien, Canada, LDCs, WTO, IMF, World, Bank, UN, Canada, Canada, Canada"
"4271",4271,"131","131.    He gave the example of apparel imported from an LDC, which would qualify for duty free and quota free access if first, the apparel was assembled in that LDC; second, it was made from fabric cut or knit to shape in that same LDC; and third, if the fabric or yarn originated in that same LDC. Apparel cut and sewn in an LDC could also qualify if it used imported fabrics or yarns so long as first, WT/COMTD/M/41 Page 32 there was 25 per cent value added in the LDC in producing (cutting and sewing) the apparel; and second, the imported fabric or yarn originated in another LDC or a developing country. For fabric to be considered originating, it needed to be made from yarn produced in an LDC or developing country, and the yarn needed to be spun or extruded in the LDC or developing country. In short, the rules of origin for apparel would allow cumulation not just from other LDCs but also from developing countries, hence encouraging greater trade with developing countries as well as from Canada. To further ensure that the benefits went where they were intended, LDCs would be required to sign an undertaking to cooperate on the exchange of information for verification purposes. His Government would also be putting in place an enhanced and more targeted monitoring, verification and investigation regime on textiles and apparel. The purpose of that action was to deter illegal transhipments that would erode the benefits to LDCs. In addition to apparel, his Government extended the duty free and quota free regime for LDCs to also cover other products of key interest to those countries, including textiles and most agricultural products, as well as other industrial products. He said that more details would be provided in the fall as his Government prepared to implement its new duty free and quota free regime on 1 January 2003. He concluded by saying that his Government's new LDC market access initiative was far-reaching and designed to give LDCs preferential treatment in the products of key interest to them. His delegation would provide a notification on that new regime in due course.","WTCOMTDM41.pdf","LDC, LDC, Canada, LDCs"

"4276",4276,"14","14.     Deputy Director-General Mr. Ravier said that the first conference room paper CRP/1, prepared by the Secretariat was circulated on 26 June, an extract of which was available for Members. That document intended to summarise the status of the implementation of the 2002 Technical                                                                                   WT/COMTD/M/41                                                                                           Page 5 Assistance Plan and covered a number of specific points on technical co-operation activities that had been raised by delegations during the last CTD meeting. The paper covered eight points.","WTCOMTDM41.pdf","Director-General, Ravier, Secretariat, Members"
"4277",4277,"15","15.      The first point was about the implementation of the 2002 Technical Assistance Plan. What Members needed to keep in mind was that, as of 30 June, a total of 261 activities had been undertaken, including 185 planned activities. That was 36 per cent of the activities in the 2002 Technical Assistance Plan. There was a discrepancy between planned activities and activities actually implemented. That discrepancy was due to the ad-hoc requests. He said that he would not wish to enter into the discussion on ad-hoc versus planned activities. The number of ad-hoc requests were so substantial that it might prevent the Secretariat from having an efficient management policy. Ad-hoc activities went against sound management and obliged the Secretariat to take difficult decisions in order to fulfil the activities in due time. The Director General had recently taken the decision to recruit some professionals on yearly contracts to help the Secretariat deliver technical assistance activities. That should allow the Secretariat to keep to the Plan and enable it to present to Members, by the end of the year, an implementation ratio close to one hundred percent.","WTCOMTDM41.pdf","Members, Secretariat, Secretariat, Director, Secretariat, Secretariat, Members"
"4278",4278,"16","16.     The second point related to the cooperation with regional development banks. He said that the first meeting with heads of regional development banks had been convened by the Director-General on 3 May 2002 in Geneva. Participants in that meeting had reached an understanding to maintain the strategic partnership between the WTO and regional development banks as seen in Annex I of the conference room paper CRP/1. So far, collaboration had been formalised with the Arab Monetary Fund, the Asian Development Bank, the Inter-American Development Bank and the Islamic Development Bank. The Secretariat was currently working towards setting up the same kind of Memorandum of Understanding with other regional development banks, notably the African Development Bank.","WTCOMTDM41.pdf","Director-General, Geneva, WTO, Arab, Monetary, Fund, Asian, Development, Bank, Inter-American, Development, Bank, Islamic, Development, Bank, Secretariat, African, Development, Bank"
"4279",4279,"17","17.     The third point covered the questions of mainstreaming trade through Ministerial trade conferences and experience had been gained with a trade ministers' Conference organised by the Inter-American Development Bank with the collaboration of the WTO in February 2002. That Conference showed a way to enhance the understanding of the concept of mainstreaming trade policies into global economic development policies in developing, developed and transition economies. He said that the Secretariat hoped to institutionalize that kind of format in partnership with the regional development banks he had mentioned. The WTO Secretariat would work with finance and trade ministries in various developing country regions to ensure that trade was, and continued to be, mainstreamed into development plans and strategies for poverty reduction. So far, two ministerial conferences involving trade and finance officials had been organised, one in Tbilisi, Georgia in May 2002 and the other in Zagreb, Croatia in June 2002.","WTCOMTDM41.pdf","Inter-American, Development, Bank, WTO, Secretariat, WTO, Secretariat, Tbilisi, Georgia, Zagreb, Croatia"
"4280",4280,"18","18.     The fourth point related to the establishment of the Doha Development Agenda Database on Trade-Related Technical Assistance and Capacity-Building. He said that it was a joint exercise between the WTO and the Development Assistance Committee of the OECD and the idea was to set up a database that would answer the question of who did what. The database was based on matrices and its main unit was the ""country file"". The idea was to develop a matrix for each country consisting of lines containing the different technical assistance activities and columns showing which activity was undertaken by what agency in the field of trade related technical assistance. One important step had been to reach a common definition of those activities, and that work had already been completed. He said the work was going well and a demonstration of the main features of the database would be organised for the high-level meeting on technical assistance for senior officials on 16 July. There would also be a demonstration at the next Trade Negotiations Committee on 19 July.","WTCOMTDM41.pdf","Doha, Development, Agenda, Database, on, Trade-Related, Technical, Assistance, WTO, Development, Assistance, Committee, OECD, Committee"
"4281",4281,"19","19.     The fifth point related to Inter-Agency Cooperation. He said that despite the fact that the paragraph on inter-agency cooperation in document CRP/1 was short, cooperation was at the core of WT/COMTD/M/41 Page 6 the Secretariat's activities and was functioning efficiently both within the frameworks that had been set up with a number of inter-governmental organizations and on a day-to-day basis.","WTCOMTDM41.pdf","Secretariat"
"4282",4282,"2","2.

"4283",4283,"20","20.     The sixth point related to the Report of the Pledging Conference. He said that Members had seen that WT/COMTD/37/Rev.1 reflected the comments made by delegations.","WTCOMTDM41.pdf","Members"
"4284",4284,"21","21.      The seventh point concerned the Doha Development Agenda Advanced Training Courses. He said he would revert to that at a later time when speaking on the training activities. Annex II of document CRP/1 showed where Members stood on the Advanced Training Courses for Trade Policy Officials. It was an undertaking that was considered in Annex I of the 2002 Technical Assistance Plan. The programme for those advanced training courses would be jointly delivered in a tri-party relationship between the WTO, Academic Centres of Excellence, Research Institutions, Policy Oriented Think Thanks, and Regional Development Banks. The first of those two-week courses had been organised in June 2002 in the Western Hemisphere with the collaboration of the Organisation of American States and Georgetown University to the benefit of Latin American Countries. Other courses would follow according to the plan that appeared in Annex II.","WTCOMTDM41.pdf","Doha, Development, Agenda, Advanced, Training, Courses, Members, WTO, Western, Hemisphere, Organisation, of, American, States, Georgetown, University"
"4285",4285,"22","22.     The final point was with respect to item C(v) of the agenda on the 2003 Technical Assistance Plan. He recalled that the Secretariat had requested all delegations to forward their priority requests for 2003 to the Secretariat by 31 July 2002, so as to allow the WTO Secretariat to submit the draft 2003 Technical Assistance Plan immediately after the summer break. The 2003 Plan would be drafted in August. However, that depended entirely on delegations' inputs. He reminded Members, observers and international organizations of the initial announcement made at the Fortieth Session of the CTD on 25 April. The draft 2003 Technical Assistance Plan would be submitted to the CTD for authorisation in October 2002. A note on the financial implications of the 2003 Plan would be submitted to the BFA Committee in November 2002. A pledging conference would be held in December 2002/January 2003.","WTCOMTDM41.pdf","Secretariat, Secretariat, WTO, Secretariat, Members, CTD, CTD, BFA, Committee"
"4286",4286,"23","23.      He went on to say conference room paper CRP/2 contained a list of all the training activities offered by the Secretariat as a whole in 2002. The presentation in a single document should provide Members with information on all the WTO's training activities. There were three categories of activities. Those held in Geneva, long-distance training activities and field-based activities at the regional level. There were five types of Geneva-based activities. The first four lines of the table in CRP/2 covered trade policy courses organized in Geneva, which lasted for a period of 12 weeks. They were the main pillar of the training provided by the WTO Training Institute. The 19th training course, in English, had ended in April for the majority of the participants with the exception of those from the Commonwealth. The Training Institute and the Commonwealth Secretariat had organized two extra weeks of training for the participants from the Commonwealth. The 19th course had been immediately followed by the 20th course, in Spanish, which would end at the end of July. For the first time, the Training Institute would hold two parallel trade policy courses beginning in September 2002. Those would be held in English in the two new training rooms that were being built on the fourth floor of the WTO building. Line five and six of the table showed the WTO introduction courses for LDCs, which lasted for three weeks. The first such course given by the Institute had been held in English in March 2002. The programme and the training material had been updated and through a strengthening of cooperation with the International Trade Centre (ITC), a concrete hands-on approach had been used to attempt to address the specific interests of LDCs. That type of approach would be used for the second course in French to be held in November 2002. The third type of training involved the specialized courses on rules and procedures for dispute settlement, each lasting one week. Delegations were already familiar with those courses. The training programme and material for that activity, which was conducted with the cooperation of the Legal Affairs Division and the Secretariat of the Appellate Body, had been partially modified. The fourth element of training involved the WTO induction days which were mainly intended for new arrivals to Geneva. Two of those had already been carried out, one in February and one in May. A third one would be held in                                                                                    WT/COMTD/M/41                                                                                            Page 7 mid-September. The fifth element of training concerned the training of trainers. The first phase of the programme, launched in the spring would continue through the fall. The programme already seemed to be yielding fruitful results which related to a qualitative change in the approach to training carried out by the collaborators from the Secretariat. The second phase would take place near the end of the year and was currently being prepared by the Secretariat. That would enable the Secretariat to address the needs of its training partners in the developing countries themselves. He said that in the CTD Members had always said that the Secretariat had to improve the quality of trainers so that those following the training activities could benefit from the higher quality of the trainers' work. That type of activity only made sense if the training for trainers could be broadened to reach those in developing countries, so that there could be teams of trainers in the countries which were benefitting from the WTO training programmes.","WTCOMTDM41.pdf","Secretariat, Members, WTO, Geneva, Geneva, WTO, Training, Institute, Training, Institute, Commonwealth, Secretariat, Commonwealth, Training, Institute, WTO, WTO, Institute, ITC, Secretariat, WTO, Geneva, Secretariat, Secretariat, Secretariat, Members, Secretariat, WTO"
"4287",4287,"24","24.      He went on to speak about the other two categories of activities, the distance learning activities and the activities in the field. There were two types of distance learning. The first was video conferencing where the Training Institute, in close cooperation with the World Bank, had taken part in five conferences held simultaneously in Geneva and Washington and four other sites in developing countries. To date there had been twenty hours of training given in twenty developing country partners, using the telecommunications technology and the infrastructure set up by the World Bank as part of its ""Global Development Learning Network"" programme. The second type of distance learning was the new online courses. After several months of designing the courses, the Training Institute had initiated an introductory course to the WTO and its fundamental principles, which was currently available on the Internet in English. The participants were guided by tutors which made the courses truly interactive. It was still a pilot project in which around 50 national officials from 30 developing countries took part. The lessons to be learnt from that pilot project would enable the Secretariat in 2003, to launch a series of Internet-based interactive courses in the three official languages of the WTO on various subjects. He said that the third category of training activities at the WTO were the field-based activities. Those were activities conducted outside Geneva. The first two lines under that heading showed two new trade policy courses lasting three months. They would be held in Casablanca in French and in Nairobi in English, and would start on 8 and 15 July respectively. He said that those recent initiatives taken by the Director-General were supplementary to the regular activities of the Training Institute. It was a new activity that had been launched over a short period of time. He said that there had been problems with financing but he hoped that the Secretariat would be able to obtain the necessary funds in the near future. There were also 15 short trade policy courses, which should involve more than 450 participants, and there were four advanced training programmes for negotiators which should involve around 100 participants.","WTCOMTDM41.pdf","Training, Institute, World, Bank, Geneva, Washington, World, Bank, Training, Institute, WTO, Secretariat, WTO, WTO, Geneva, Casablanca, Nairobi, Director-General, Training, Institute, Secretariat"
"4288",4288,"25","25.      He went on to mention the strengthened cooperation between the WTO Training Institute and universities. The Training Institute was moving towards such cooperation which would be non- exclusive. He recalled that one of the reasons why the Training Institute had been created was to give it a certain amount of independence which would facilitate the building of relationships with other academic institutions throughout the world. The Secretariat wanted to allow academic institutions to have an independent partner to deal with. The Secretariat's relationship with academic institutions had since developed rapidly and there were several possibilities that had been realised in the framework of that cooperation. A large number of potential partners had shown a keen interest and the Secretariat would have to choose some in a way that would not be discriminatory. The Secretariat would have to consider the logistical problems, the different types of cooperation, and the financial and human resources available in the Institute.","WTCOMTDM41.pdf","WTO, Training, Institute, Training, Institute, Training, Institute, Secretariat, Secretariat, Secretariat, Secretariat"
"4289",4289,"26","26.      The representative of Japan said that his delegation felt that the technical assistance and capacity-building activities were important instruments to effectively integrate beneficiary countries into the multilateral trade system. His delegation was ready to continue to support the efforts by beneficiary countries through the WTO, other international organizations or through bilateral activities. He said that he wished to make three points. The first was with respect to the revised WT/COMTD/M/41 Page 8 version of the Report of the Pledging Conference. His delegation was one of those which had registered concern over the previous version and it appreciated the improved version that the Secretariat had provided. The second point was that his delegation was pleased that the Secretariat currently was better equipped to meet the target of the Technical Assistance Plan for 2002, since his delegation had had certain concerns regarding the pace with which the Secretariat had implemented the planned activities. In that regard he noted that Mr. Ravier had mentioned that ad hoc requests were being made that it would take time to respond to. The preparation time for the 2002 Technical Assistance Plan had been rather limited. That was one of the main reasons why ad hoc requests were being made by delegations. The third point was that, in order to frame the 2003 Technical Assistance Plan, Members needed to keep the pace explained by Mr. Ravier. That would give for the 2003 Technical Assistance Plan a better prospect of success. He said that in order for it to be successful it was important to monitor the effectiveness and pace of the implementation of the activities and then report back to the CTD or any other fora. That would provide Members with a view about what had to be improved and what should be continued in the following year. Reflecting on his Government's bilateral experience with other developing partners, he said that it was important for beneficiary countries to tactically choose the activities in order for them to improve the capacity within that beneficiary country's government. His delegation would therefore welcome information from the Secretariat with respect to how it chose the trainees of the training activities, the effectiveness of those activities, the pace of future activities and how the Secretariat could encourage the beneficiary countries to provide their priority requests by the end of July.","WTCOMTDM41.pdf","Japan, WTO, Secretariat, Secretariat, Secretariat, Ravier, Members, Ravier, CTD, Members, Secretariat, Secretariat"
"4290",4290,"27","27.      The representative of Venezuela reiterated that her delegation attached great importance to the issue of technical assistance and capacity building. Paragraph 3 of document CPR/1 indicated that 185 different activities had been planned and carried out. Of those, 75 had responded to requests by members. Her delegation was pleased that the Secretariat was taking into account requests which had not been included in the Plan and which responded to the requirements of developing countries. Her delegation noted that 37 per cent of the activities under the Technical Assistance Plan had been carried out and agreed with the representative of Japan in that the Secretariat had to improve the pace of implementation in order for all the planned activities to be carried out. That would enable the Secretariat to respond to the ad hoc requests made by Members. She said that she wished to make a distinction between ""regular"" technical assistance coming from the WTO which related to the application of the agreements and the ""new"" technical assistance which responded to the different goals set for Members, especially the developing country Members, at the Doha Ministerial Conference. Her delegation would be concerned if the importance of the normal technical assistance programmes which dealt with the application and implementation of Agreements, for example, the trade policy review, were left aside. There should be no imbalance between the two types of technical assistance and she hoped that the Secretariat could make a distinction between those two types of technical assistance. Her delegation was pleased with the efforts made to strengthen the ties with regional development banks and to carry out the work plan approved by Ministers at the Doha Ministerial Conference with respect to inter-agency cooperation. She noted the distinction made between cooperation with the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) which was referred to in the document as ""an effective form of fusion with WIPO"", and cooperation with UNCTAD which was progressing on an ad-hoc basis. Cooperation between agencies was important and cooperation with UNCTAD deserved special attention. Her delegation hoped that future cooperation, in all its aspects, would become effective and efficient.","WTCOMTDM41.pdf","Venezuela, Secretariat, Japan, Secretariat, Secretariat, Members, WTO, Members, Members, Doha, Ministerial, Conference, Secretariat, Doha, Ministerial, Conference, World, Intellectual, Property, Organization, WIPO, WIPO, UNCTAD, UNCTAD"
"4291",4291,"28","28.     She went on to say that DDG Ravier had reported that the training programmes were working well and that their objectives had been updated in order to improve the participation in negotiations. Her delegation was pleased to see that courses had been organised jointly by the WTO and Georgetown University. Making a distinction between training provided in Geneva, distance training and training in the field was positive. With respect to distance learning activities, her delegation wished to know when the pilot courses would be established so that Members could follow them in Spanish. With respect to the training for trainers programme, she said that it would improve the                                                                                       WT/COMTD/M/41                                                                                               Page 9 quality of trainers so that they could improve the quality of their work. Her delegation had a concept of training that went somewhat beyond that. It felt that training was for public officials, whether or not they were negotiators. The consequence of that training would be to build the capacity of officials in carrying out activities in relation to trade. It was her delegation's understanding from the report that the training of trainers programme was being strengthened. Another aspect was the ""export"" of such courses to the regions. Two pilot projects already existed in Africa and, at the last CTD meeting, Members had been informed that such projects would be launched in other regions, including Latin America and the Caribbean. Her delegation's expectation was to have a broader group of public officials in the regions making use of the resources made available to them. Many of the facilitators would be the negotiators and officials who had attended the training programme in Geneva. The third aspect was a much broader view of the training. The fourth part of ""Strengthening Cooperation between the Institute and Universities"" in the report referred to the training of professors who taught WTO disciplines in universities and postgraduate institutes. That was important and the WTO Secretariat had to pay close attention to that group of people for two reasons. Firstly, in addition to professionals aiming for public service employment, universities also trained people intending to go into private-sector firms and the private sector also needed a better grasp of WTO objectives and principles since many firms were affected by the processes and the decisions adopted in the WTO. Countless professors from her country taught WTO disciplines in universities and postgraduate study centres, with the best of intentions. However, the knowledge they had about the WTO and its Agreements was limited in many cases. That was why her delegation felt that it was the Secretariat's duty to provide the tools that those professors required to be able to teach in a more effective way. That could contribute to improving the negative image in universities of what the WTO's principles and long-term goals were. Teaching clarified doubts which, in many cases, arose as a result of the lack of information. That was in line with what was proposed by the WTO on pages 17 and 16 in its booklet ""The Road to Doha and Beyond"". She concluded by saying that it was important to keep the spirit of independence which existed in universities. That independent spirit brought with it challenges but would enable Members to improve the image of the WTO in teaching institutions in her country.","WTCOMTDM41.pdf","Ravier, WTO, Georgetown, University, Geneva, Members, Africa, Members, Latin, America, Caribbean, Geneva, Institute, and, Universities, WTO, WTO, Secretariat, WTO, WTO, WTO, WTO, Secretariat, WTO, WTO, Doha, Members, WTO"

His delegation had proposed that in addition to the trade policy courses conducted in Geneva it would be worthwhile to have ten to twelve week duration trade policy courses in host countries on a regional or country-specific basis. He said that he was pleased that the Secretariat had been able to operationalize that proposal. His delegation sought clarification with respect to the location of the field-based training activities. He asked whether they were demand driven, in terms of the host country requesting for the courses, as was the case with the delegations of Kenya and Morocco. He asked if that was so, who would finance those courses, whether the financing would be on a joint basis, and whether other governments could apply to host such courses Holding field-based trade policy courses was beneficial for any country as the training could reach a larger number of people.","WTCOMTDM41.pdf","Pakistan, Geneva, Secretariat, Kenya, Morocco"

The representative of Colombia said that despite the fact that there were a large number of technical assistance activities which remained to be carried out during the rest of the year, she commended the effort put into implementing the agreed activities for 2002. However, her delegation hoped that the rate of implementation would improve in 2003. Her Government was of the view that predictability and regional balance in the distribution of activities were key factors on which the new technical cooperation strategy should be based. Developing country beneficiaries would through such capacity building be provided with additional knowledge and increased negotiating power which would help them achieve fuller participation in the multilateral trading system. Her delegation hoped that those two elements, together with its request for technical cooperation activities, would be pivotal in the preparation of the 2003 Technical Assistance Plan and that the personal decisions of some members of the Secretariat under no circumstances would be allowed to prevail and end up obstructing the implementation of the activities. She thanked the Technical Cooperation Division for WT/COMTD/M/41 Page 10 its contribution to the development of the regional dispute settlement seminar held in Bogotá and attended by almost 40 Latin American officials. The seminar had been highly successful and achieved its objectives. She supported the point made by the representative of Venezuela with respect to the importance of the training of trainers. The technical assistance established in the Annual Plan was of particular significance to her Government since it provided her Government's officials with training in important current issues in the short term. It was essential that it be given greater importance and that particular attention be paid to the allocation of resources to the second phase of the Training of Trainers Project and the distance-learning trade policy courses, since those were long-term projects which would enhance awareness of WTO issues in Members and would consequently have a great impact. A training of trainers programme in a university and at an international business department had been established in her country, both of which had been met with great success in all regions. That project had been set up and coordinated by the Ministry of Foreign Trade in conjunction with a group of 50 universities throughout the country and had succeeded in developing export culture. Her delegation believed that it was the universities and institutions that had made it possible to ensure that information on international trade was disseminated in a coherent and consistent manner. Students, officials and entrepreneurs were all aware of the benefits accruing to them as a result of that. It was important to increase resources for the training of trainers programme, which would increase the capacity of her Government's officials.","WTCOMTDM41.pdf","Colombia, Secretariat, Technical, Cooperation, Division, Bogotá, Venezuela, Training, of, Trainers, Project, WTO, Members, Ministry, of, Foreign, Trade"

The representative of Indonesia sought clarification on the field-based activities and asked whether the Secretariat would provide such ad-hoc trade policy courses in other regions. The Doha Development Agenda Advanced Training Course in Annex II of CRP/1 showed that the training for government officials would be organised sometime in April 2003, but his delegation was not aware of the estimated number of participants for that course. He asked if the Secretariat could provide the estimated number of participants in those activities for the Asia Pacific Region.","WTCOMTDM41.pdf","Indonesia, Secretariat, Doha, Development, Agenda, Advanced, Training, Course, Secretariat, Asia, Pacific, Region"
"4296",4296,"32","32.      The representative of Kenya said that he hoped that the delegation of Pakistan had not proposed that the costs for the ad hoc field-based trade policy courses remain ad-hoc. His delegation wished to see the courses become permanent features in Africa. That would enable African countries to participate fully in WTO activities. He said that he hoped that adequate funds would be sourced and set aside to ensure that those courses were run on a permanent basis. His delegation hoped that the Geneva-based training of trainers activities could be included in the field-based activities. He said that perhaps they could borrow the form used in the JITAP programme which had a training component, so that there would be trainers in the host countries who could expand the training. He said that with respect to the 2003 Technical Assistance Plan, a deadline of 31 July for the submission of requests had been set. That deadline was close in time and delegations sometimes needed technical assistance to identify their technical assistance needs. Members had to consider that when working on the work programme. He proposed that the Secretariat send missions to Members that had not been responding in time to assist them identify their technical assistance needs. That would make the work programme comprehensive and minimise the number of ad-hoc requests.","WTCOMTDM41.pdf","Kenya, Pakistan, Africa, WTO, Members, Secretariat, Members"
"4297",4297,"33","33.      The representative of Canada said that her delegation felt that the start, in the first part of the year, in the delivery of the Doha Development Agenda Technical Assistance was impressive. 2002 was clearly a year of learning. Many different modes of delivery were being tried, from short and medium to long-term types of programmes both in Geneva and the field. Her delegation hoped that those were being monitored through the work of Mr. Paul Rolian, Director of the Technical Cooperation Audit, and looked forward to a report on all those various activities. She said that with respect to the question of ad-hoc versus planned activities, her delegation had noted, as had other delegations, that approximately a third of the technical assistance activities that had taken place were ad hoc activities. That was not necessarily good or bad. However, it did have financial and staffing implications. Her delegation hoped that when the report was provided, it would indicate where the planned activities had been delivered, where ad-hoc activities had been introduced, why the ad-hoc activities had been given priority over planned activities and what activities had not been delivered                                                                                     WT/COMTD/M/41                                                                                            Page 11 and why. She said that she was certain there were good reasons why some planned activities were not delivered. There might for example be timing constraints. Her delegation wished to see that presented in the end of the year report to get the full picture. Her delegation appreciated the Secretariat's work towards a 2003 Plan which would reduce the number of ad-hoc activities bringing the planned and delivered activities much closer together.","WTCOMTDM41.pdf","Canada, Doha, Development, Agenda, Technical, Assistance, Geneva, Paul, Rolian, Director, Technical, Cooperation, Audit, Secretariat"
"4298",4298,"34","34.      The representative of the European Communities said that the comments he was about to make were only to allow for the optimal preparation of the mid-July event on technical assistance and the preparation of a report at the end of the year. He questioned whether the CRP form of documents for the information on the Implementation of the 2002 Technical Assistance Plan was the best way to proceed. Those documents were not available on the website and he asked why the information could not be provided in the form of normal WTO documents that would allow maximum diffusion and distribution of that information. He said that it was not clear whether the situation regarding the ad-hoc activities had improved and what the financial implications would be of the planned activities and the extra one third ad-hoc activities taking place. He asked what criteria the Secretariat would use when deciding on the execution of new ad hoc activities. It was his understanding that unless the criteria was made clear, the Trust Fund would be difficult to use. His delegation felt that the database was important. However, there seemed to have been problems with the information gathering with the OECD with respect to how the activities would be classified. His delegation asked for information on progress in that regard. With respect to point 9 in CPR/1 on Inter-Agency Cooperation, he suggested that the Secretariat provide Members with a short outline of what the state of play was with the various other agencies in terms of what sort of memorandum had been concluded, what cooperation had been made, and what was envisaged. That could be part of the preparation of the 2003 Technical Assistance Plan. It was sometimes difficult ex-post to evaluate and consider the number of numerous activities, but it was important to get an idea on how the issue was moving forward.","WTCOMTDM41.pdf","European, Communities, CRP, WTO, Secretariat, Trust, Fund, OECD, Secretariat, Members"
"4299",4299,"35","35.      He went on to say that with respect to the activities under training, including those covered by the Training Institute and by other parts of the Secretariat, his delegation wished to have more information on who exactly did what and why. From his delegation's point of view, training was different to technical assistance because it was mainly a deductive exercise and it might be useful to ensure that the necessary know how and synergies, which were possible were fully utilised, even if different WTO divisions were involved. He noted that the number of participants in the African field- based course had decreased from 25 to 19. He asked what implication that would have on costs and on the ratio of trainers to trainees, which, in his delegation's view, might not even initially have been optimal. He said that with respect to point 12 of CRP/1, it was interesting to hear what the representative of Kenya had said on the planning and the difficulty to get the necessary information. His delegation was pleased that the Secretariat had undertaken steps to ensure that the information necessary could come forward, not only from Members' missions but also directly from their governments. His delegation believed that there were other sources to ensure that the Plan broadly covered all the issues that Members wished to address. He gave the example of his delegation's wish to ensure that the information from other Committees dealing with technical assistance was adequately taken into account. He asked the Chairman to ensure that that source was used to fully assess the needs of Members. Going through what had been done in other WTO Committees on technical assistance was one way to ensure that nothing was forgotten, no country was overlooked, and that all aspects of what should be done were taken into account. With respect to the point made on auditing, he said that it was still early to talk about the first experiences with the 2002 Annual Technical Assistance Plan because any auditing exercise had just begun and there would not be much of a result available. However, by the end of the year some sort of ongoing evaluation should be part of the exercise in order to give delegations a full picture of what was taking place.","WTCOMTDM41.pdf","Training, Institute, Secretariat, WTO, Kenya, Secretariat, Members, Members, Chairman, Members, WTO, Committees"
"4300",4300,"36","36.    The representative of Morocco said that the trade policy course to be held in Casablanca in July would be the first trade policy course in French to be held outside Geneva. That course would be WT/COMTD/M/41 Page 12 held in partnership with the Institut Supérieur de Commerce et de Gestion d'Entreprise (ISCAE) in Casablanca. That was concrete proof of a good form of cooperation with universities which his delegation had always advocated, particularly in the CTD. His delegation believed that that additional activity was a good initiative which would help to establish real proximity in a continent where there was great need for technical assistance and capacity-building. His delegation hoped that that type of activity would be expanded to other regions in the future. He said that the Memorandum of Understanding that had been signed between the Casablanca Institute and the WTO Training Institute was a concrete example of the new strategy within a framework of activities which was strategic and beneficial to the WTO and which was aimed at capacity building and bringing about a greater proximity.","WTCOMTDM41.pdf","Morocco, Casablanca, Geneva, Institut, Supérieur, de, Commerce, Casablanca, CTD, Casablanca, Institute, WTO, Training, Institute, WTO"
"4301",4301,"37","37.      The representative of China said that his delegation, like other developing Member countries, attached great importance to the issue of capacity-building. However, it was unfortunate that, in spite of the efforts made, it was still difficult to meet Members' increasing and diversified needs. It was his delegation's view that capacity-building was part of a country's development endeavour. No single agency, including the WTO, could meet all the demands in that area. It was thus important to find creative ways to match the resources of the WTO with other resources. His delegation was pleased to see that the WTO Secretariat had begun cooperation with regional development banks. That was a typical example of how the WTO resources could be used as a leverage. Cooperation with regional development banks would be conducive to making the training activities more relevant in the regional context. It was his delegation's view that the potential capacity of developing country Members to be involved in technical assistance activities should not be underestimated. There were many existing training facilities, human resources, and sometimes financial resources available in developing Members countries that could be used. The question was how to integrate all those factors into professional training activities. In that respect, his delegation suggested that the Technical Cooperation Division develop a handbook to help developing countries develop and implement training and technical assistance activities for themselves and by themselves.","WTCOMTDM41.pdf","China, Member, Members, WTO, WTO, WTO, Secretariat, WTO, Members, Members, Technical, Cooperation, Division"

The national and regional seminars had been well attended and Omani officials had been satisfied with the results. She said that her Government, as one of the recently acceded Members, had extensive obligations that had to be implemented immediately, without any transitional periods. Her delegation believed that giving priority to the technical assistance provided to her Government would enable Omani officials to enhance their understanding of the obligations that had to be implemented. Technical assistance should not only be provided in the form of seminars or workshops. It should also include sponsoring the participation of officials from her capital to attend seminars and meetings in Geneva. Without that type of assistance, it would always remain difficult for her delegation to fully participate in WTO's work. She concluded by saying that her delegation would work with the Chairman in order to ensure that its needs and priorities were reflected in the 2003 Plan.","WTCOMTDM41.pdf","Oman, Members, Geneva, WTO, Chairman"

The representative of Tanzania said that the Secretariat needed to assist delegations, and especially LDCs, in coming up with activities for the 2003 Plan as the July deadline was too close. Her delegation appreciated the effort made to organize field-based trade-policy courses in Nairobi and Morocco. She said that as thirty-four of the LDCs were in Africa, her delegation expected that one of the courses would be held in one of those LDCs. If the WTO was serious in assisting LDCs to build capacity, then one of the courses should be held in an LDC. Universities existed in the LDCs. It would thus be possible to hold training there. It was only a question of selection one LDC and begin the course.","WTCOMTDM41.pdf","Tanzania, Secretariat, Nairobi, Morocco, Africa, WTO, LDC"

Her delegation would appreciate to get a clearer picture of which participants were funded by the WTO and which were                                                                                    WT/COMTD/M/41                                                                                           Page 13 self-funded. With respect to the ad hoc residential trade policy courses, she asked how the residential trade policy courses being held in certain regions would affect the participation in the regular Geneva- based trade policy courses. She asked how it could be ensured that the quality of the field-based training given in the residential trade-policy courses would be equally high as for those carried out in Geneva. With respect to the normal technical assistance activities, her delegation was aware that it might not be possible for a Member's technical assistance needs to be solely met by the WTO. Cooperation with other organizations, as well as regional development banks, could be useful to ensure a more seamless delivery of technical assistance. In some WTO Committees, such as the TBT and SPS Committees, some of the technical assistance requested was of a technical nature and went beyond the competence of the WTO. She asked how the WTO could address such needs. Her delegation was aware that some WTO agreements provided for technical assistance on a bilateral basis. She asked how the Technical Cooperation Division could work with the bilateral providers to meet some of those requests which could be met more substantively.","WTCOMTDM41.pdf","Malaysia, WTO, Geneva, Geneva, Member, WTO, WTO, Committees, TBT, WTO, WTO, WTO"

Her delegation hoped that the Secretariat would give priority to the training of civil servants in Member countries so that they could train other trainers on trade policy.

"4309",4309,"44","44.     The Chairman said that technical assistance and capacity-building was an important part of the work of the CTD. A number of delegations had raised questions, commented on the programmes, and made useful suggestions for the future. He asked Deputy Director-General Mr. Ravier to respond to some of the main questions that had been raised in the meeting.","WTCOMTDM41.pdf","Chairman, CTD, Director-General, Ravier"
"4310",4310,"45","45.      Deputy Director-General Mr. Ravier said that the Secretariat had noted the many statements made and would respond individually to Members on questions he would not mention. A number of the questions asked dealt with the field-based activities. The field-based activities related to three different products. They were the ad hoc residential trade policy courses in Nairobi and Casablanca, the short trade policy courses and the advanced training programme for negotiators which was described in Annex I of the 2002 Technical Assistance Plan. All were new activities which had to be evaluated before they were prolonged or extended. The ad hoc residential trade policy courses represented a first attempt to deliver ad hoc trade policy courses. The reason why they were being delivered in the African countries was because it was on the African continent that the needs were the greatest. Those courses were demand-driven and it was possible to hold them in other countries. The Director-General, during his trips to Africa over the past month, had noted that the needs were WT/COMTD/M/41 Page 14 greatest there and thus the choice of having the courses in one Anglophone and one Francophone African country had been made according to needs expressed. That did not mean that there were no needs elsewhere and that the Secretariat would not take other needs into account if they were expressed. However, the two courses first had to be held and evaluated. In response to the question posed by the delegation of Malaysia as to how it could be ensured that the quality of those courses would be as high as those being held in Geneva, he said that once the courses had taken place, their effectiveness could be evaluated. The Training Institute had closely followed the process of preparing the courses in line with the Geneva-based courses and the teaching staff would be a mix of local trainers, people from the WTO Secretariat, and people from outside the WTO Secretariat. There was no reason to believe that the quality of the residential training courses would be lower than that of the courses held at the WTO. The only difference was that participants in a course held at the WTO headquarters would be able to meet with delegations and attend WTO meetings. From that point of view there was an additional advantage of attending the Geneva-based courses. Apart that, everything else should qualitatively be the same as what took place in Geneva.","WTCOMTDM41.pdf","Director-General, Ravier, Secretariat, Members, Nairobi, Casablanca, Director-General, Africa, Secretariat, Malaysia, Geneva, Training, Institute, WTO, Secretariat, WTO, Secretariat, WTO, WTO, WTO, Geneva"
"4311",4311,"46","46.      He went on to say that the Advanced Training Programme for Government Officials and Negotiators was a direct result of the fact that a round had been launched at the Doha Ministerial Conference and that there was an upcoming Ministerial Conference. Members had therefore identified the need to improve the negotiating capacity of government officials in charge of trade policy. That was why those courses were going to focus on negotiation skills. They would not be general courses on the WTO, but would focus on negotiation techniques. He said that Members could see in CRP/1 that one of the courses had already taken place and that other courses would take place in Arab countries, Central Europe, the African Anglophone countries throughout 2002. The courses would then continue in 2003 in Asia and the Pacific. With respect to the question on the Asia/Pacific course, he said that it would in principle take place at the Beijing University with the help of the Asian Development Bank, and that it would be given to 29 participating countries, with one participant from each country. The short-term trade policy courses were also the result of demand. Members had expressed the view that the short-term trade policy courses were a good product that should be kept. However, Members wished to have something more flexible so that those courses could be delivered in the field over a shorter time-period. The Secretariat had then offered courses with a duration of three weeks in the requesting countries. In response to the question from the delegation of the European Communities regarding the difference between the WTO Training Institute and WTO technical cooperation, he said that it was not useful to get into that debate. There were always difficulties in defining where the line between them should be drawn. Within technical cooperation there was constant progress with respect to its content, from basic technical cooperation which consisted of explaining the rules as they were, to a more proactive technical cooperation with a stronger focus on training. Of the three field-based activities, only the ad hoc residential trade policy courses were entirely provided by the Training Institute. The other two had a technical assistance component. That was a situation which he was not certain would last because the three field-based activities needed to be defined in the future and remained flexible. He said that the situation that Members currently saw was not necessarily the situation they would see in six months' or a year's time.","WTCOMTDM41.pdf","Advanced, Training, Programme, Members, WTO, Members, Central, Europe, Asia, Pacific, Beijing, University, Asian, Development, Bank, Members, Members, Secretariat, WTO, Training, Institute, WTO, Training, Institute, Members"
"4312",4312,"47","47.      He continued by saying that some delegations had felt that the 31 July deadline was too short for Members to submit their requests for 2003. He said that the Secretariat was in the hands of the Members. If Members could not submit their requests by 31 July, then the Secretariat would have to delay the creation of the 2003 Technical Assistance Plan. However, it was necessary to stick to that deadline if Members wished to present the 2003 Plan to the October meeting of the CTD and the Budget Committee at the end of November and be able to finalise before the end of 2002. Members would otherwise find themselves in the same situation that they had found themselves in 2002, with the 2003 Plan only to be approved by the CTD in March 2003. That would delay and make the implementation of the programme difficult. The longer the deadline of 31 July was put off, the more difficult it would be to have the Plan ready for 2003. He said that, with respect to identifying needs,                                                                                    WT/COMTD/M/41                                                                                           Page 15 he had heard Members say that they needed technical cooperation to enable them to identify their technical cooperation needs. Everything was possible. However, missions by definition were expensive because people needed to be sent out to the different countries. That was why the Secretariat did not leave identification of needs by missions. Sending out special missions to identify technical cooperation needs meant that there would be less resources available to provide regular technical cooperation. With respect to the question posed by the delegation of Egypt on the internet courses, he said that the pilot programme included some fifty participants from thirty different developing countries. Once the evaluation of that activity had been carried out, the Secretariat would be able to see how to develop the programme further.","WTCOMTDM41.pdf","Members, Secretariat, Members, Members, Secretariat, Members, CTD, Budget, Committee, Members, CTD, Members, Secretariat, Egypt, Secretariat"

In their opening statements, the UNCTAD Secretary-General and the WTO Deputy Director-General had underscored the high quality of ITC's work. They had both pointed out that ITC, UNCTAD and the WTO had pursued and expanded their cooperation, especially with regard to the LDCs. The WTO DDG had also emphasized that, in the Doha Ministerial Declaration, the Ministers had reaffirmed their support for the work done by ITC and had stressed that it should be further enhanced. In that connection, the DDG had expressed the wish that ITC's donors allocate extra funding so that the ITC could step up its efforts to increase the capabilities of developing countries. The Director-General of UNIDO, who had attended a meeting of the Joint Advisory Group for the first time, had referred to the increased cooperation between UNIDO and ITC, UNCTAD and the WTO and trusted that such meetings would help UNIDO to find better ways to interact and achieve joint objectives by working cooperatively. In his introductory statement, the Executive Director of the ITC had noted that, over the past three years, the ITC had worked towards becoming a more focused organization. Its emphasis was directly focused on the critical issue of building national capacities for international competitiveness. The Executive Director had said that he hoped that the thirty-fifth session of the JAG would provide ITC with the guidance and resources it needed to respond comprehensively to the challenge of delivering trade-related assistance and capacity building in the post-Doha era. The Joint Advisory Group had expressed its satisfaction with ITC's performance in 2001, noting that the organization had maintained its role as a key niche player in its sphere, and had offered high quality service to its clients. A number of topics had been addressed in the general debate. The Joint Advisory Group considered that the Joint Integrated Technical Assistance Programme (JITAP) and its coordinated approach to technical cooperation had worked extremely well. Some representatives had recommended, not only that JITAP be continued, but also that the approach be replicated in other developing countries. Several representatives had underscored the importance of the World Trade Net programme in building business capabilities for WT/COMTD/M/41 Page 16 timely inputs into preparations for negotiations and in reinforcing cooperation between the business community and trade policy makers. Comments had also been made on ITC's participation in the Integrated Framework initiative, and the organization had undertaken to provide active export development support for countries participating in the Integrated Framework. Other delegations had encouraged ITC to work towards an expansion of the number of LDCs involved. The Joint Advisory Group had mentioned the role played by ITC in fostering the public-private sector partnership both in the preparations for and in the follow-up to the Doha Ministerial Conference. It had noted ITC's work in the area of trade in services and commended the launching of the E-Trade Bridge programme, which was seen to be relevant to the future international competitiveness of developing and transition economies, despite the connectivity problems encountered by many of them. In addition, the Joint Advisory Group had taken note of the Report of the Consultative Committee on ITC's Global Trust Fund.","WTCOMTDM41.pdf","Ambassador, Girard, ITC, UNCTAD, WTO, Director-General, ITC, ITC, UNCTAD, WTO, WTO, DDG, ITC, DDG, ITC, ITC, Director-General, UNIDO, Joint, Advisory, Group, UNIDO, ITC, UNCTAD, WTO, UNIDO, Director, ITC, ITC, Director, ITC, Joint, Advisory, Group, ITC, Joint, Advisory, Group, Joint, Integrated, Technical, Assistance, Programme, ITC, ITC, Joint, Advisory, Group, ITC, Doha, Ministerial, Conference, ITC, Joint, Advisory, Group, Consultative, Committee, ITC, Global, Trust, Fund"

He continued by saying that with respect to the specific topic of the Doha Development Agenda, the JAG had registered that in a paper ITC had identified existing programmes and priorities of developing countries, including LDCs and economies in transition, and had assessed its own capacity to deliver. The JAG had acknowledged that ITC was well positioned to make a contribution but that it had to expand its resource base to implement its planned approach.","WTCOMTDM41.pdf","Doha, Development, Agenda, ITC, ITC"
"4319",4319,"53","53.      He went on to draw Members' attention to paragraphs 89 to 91 of the JAG Report, that was, relating to item 8 of the JAG agenda. At the thirty-fourth session of the JAG, held in the spring of 2001, a proposal had been made for issuing official documentation of the JAG in the Arabic and Chinese languages, in addition to the four current languages of publication. The request had been costed and included in the ITC budget submission to the United Nations and the WTO. However, no political decision had been reached at the WTO General Council or the UNCTAD Trade and Development Committee, which would have enabled the budgetary organs to consider the increased costs involved. The question had been raised once again at the JAG's thirty-fifth session in 2002. Following that meeting, he had received a communication from the Egyptian Ambassador urging him to reiterate to ITC's parent organizations how important it was for the documents of the JAG to be translated into Arabic and Chinese. He asked the CTD Chairman to consider that request so that a decision could be reached during the next budget cycle. He concluded by expressing, on behalf of the JAG, his gratitude to the numerous governments that had announced financial contributions to the ITC at that session, namely the delegations of Canada, China, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, India, Ireland, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland and the United Kingdom.","WTCOMTDM41.pdf","Members, ITC, United, Nations, WTO, WTO, General, Council, UNCTAD, Trade, and, Development, Committee, Ambassador, ITC, CTD, Chairman, ITC, Canada, China, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, India, Ireland, Italy, Netherlands, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland, United, Kingdom"
"4320",4320,"54","54.     The representative of Egypt said that his delegation appreciated the quality of the technical assistance provided by the ITC and hoped that it would be extended to as wide a range of sectors as possible. That was why his delegation, on behalf of the Arab Group, wished to see the CTD, and subsequently the General Council, approve the proposals made in paragraphs 89, 90 and 91 of the JAG Report. He reiterated that translation into Arabic of the documents of the meetings of the JAG, especially the annual report, would lead to wider dissemination of information on the activities and the technical assistance provided by the ITC in the Arab world. The greatest beneficiaries of such information dissemination would be the SMEs, which was the group that was supposed to benefit most from the ITC's activities.","WTCOMTDM41.pdf","Egypt, ITC, Arab, Group, CTD, General, Council, ITC, ITC"
"4321",4321,"55","55.     The representative of Mauritania said that the ITC efficiently supported developing countries in a concrete way. His delegation hoped that support would be given to ITC so that its high quality work could continue. His delegation supported the delegation of Egypt's request for the translation of the JAG documents into all of the working languages of the United Nations (UN) system. That was important for all the documents within the WTO and would enable all delegations to work on a level playing field.

"4322",4322,"56","56.      The representative of China supported the request made by the delegations of Egypt and Mauritania with respect to the translation of documents. It was his delegation's view that the reports of the JAG and the ITC annual report should be translated into all UN working languages. He said that his delegation had also brought up that issue in the UNCTAD Trade and Development Board and sought the support of the CTD in that respect.","WTCOMTDM41.pdf","China, Egypt, Mauritania, ITC, UN, UNCTAD, Trade, and, Development, Board, CTD"
"4323",4323,"57","57.     The representative of Senegal said that ITC's high quality technical cooperation contributions explained why the work of the JAG was followed closely by so many delegations, including his own. His delegation ensured that delegates from his capital participated every year. That was why his delegation, like others, wished to draw attention to the request for translation of documents by emphasising the fact that the preparatory documentation for the preparation of the JAG was important. Delegates from capitals were often faced with the problem that the documentation was only available in English. His delegation hoped that that problem would be resolved in the future given the importance of the work that was being done.","WTCOMTDM41.pdf","Senegal, ITC"
"4324",4324,"58","58.     The representative of the European Communities said that Members' continued support for ITC's work had been well expressed by Ambassador Girard and by what was reflected in paragraph 87 of document ITC/AG/(XXXV)/191 where the announcement of trust fund contributions were stated. He said that with respect to the point raised on the translation of documents, his delegation would have to revert to it after some reflection. It was not clear to him how the discussion on the language issue had gone in the JAG and what the nature of such a precedent would be. Members needed some more information to consider that.","WTCOMTDM41.pdf","European, Communities, Members, ITC, Ambassador, Girard, Members"

"4326",4326,"6","6.      The Chairman said that at previous meetings the Committee had had before it a number of outstanding requests for observer status. Those came from the League of Arab States, OPEC, the Gulf Organization for Industrial Consulting, the Organisation Internationale de la Francophonie and the Common Fund for Commodities. The positions of delegations were well known and on the record. He proposed that, unless there had been any recent change of position, Members revert to those requests at the next formal CTD meeting.","WTCOMTDM41.pdf","Chairman, Committee, League, of, Arab, States, OPEC, Gulf, Organization, for, Industrial, Consulting, Organisation, Internationale, de, la, Francophonie, Members"
"4327",4327,"60","60.      Deputy Director-General Ouedraogo pointed out that Members were in a WTO forum and that at the WTO the official languages were French, English and Spanish. For the time being, Members had not taken a decision regarding Chinese or Arabic. He said that asking for an endorsement from the General Council might constitute a problem. The General Council might find it difficult to take a decision on languages which, for the time being, the WTO had not adopted as official working languages. It was true that problems of translation of documents had always been a thorny issue within the WTO and many delegations had already flagged that point. Efforts were being made at the budgetary level in order to fill the gaps. He said that it was up to Members to decide. For the time being, the WTO as an organization which only worked in three official languages.","WTCOMTDM41.pdf","Director-General, Ouedraogo, Members, WTO, WTO, Members, General, Council, General, Council, WTO, WTO, Members, WTO"

He said that if Members wished more elaborate information regarding what had been done on the issue of languages following the previous year's request, such information could be provided as he had followed the issue closely with both parent organizations. The ITC was there to service the Members as well as it could and in languages Members deemed appropriate.","WTCOMTDM41.pdf","Bélisle, ITC, Members, Members, ITC, Members, Members"
"4329",4329,"62","62.    The Chairman said that it was important that the information be available in other languages for wider dissemination.

"4330",4330,"63","63.    The representative of Egypt sought clarification with respect to the ITC report. He asked if it was acceptable, when the CTD presented its report to the General Council, to specify that the proposal         2            The ITC Secretariat subsequently provided Members with information regarding the issue of languages in document WT/COMTD/40. WT/COMTD/M/41 Page 18 regarding translation of documents had been supported by several delegations and that one delegation had expressed its wish to have additional information in that regard. He asked if it would be possible to then ask the General Council to adopt the decision, as the delegation of the European Communities would then have had additional time to consider the issue and the supplementary information that they had asked for by that time.","WTCOMTDM41.pdf","Egypt, ITC, CTD, General, Council, ITC, Secretariat, Members, General, Council"

"4333",4333,"66","66.     The Chairman said that the New Partnership for Africa's Development (NEPAD) was a development policy framework first adopted by African Heads of State/Government in Lusaka in July 2001. It was a commitment by African leaders to eradicate poverty and to place Africa on a path of sustainable growth and development. NEPAD was considered as a long-term vision of an African-owned and African-led development programme. It was a plan for Africa's development which would promote, through a peer review mechanism, good governance, democracy, the rule of law, and good economic and corporate governance, in return for increased investments, aid and development support from the West, and full market access for Africa's exports. At the recently completed G8 Summit in Kananaskis, Canada, NEPAD had been on the agenda. He invited Professor Wiseman Nkuhlu, head of the NEPAD Secretariat to say a few words on the results of the G8 Summit for NEPAD, and suggest how the WTO, through its work on technical assistance and market access, could support the work of NEPAD, Africa's new development framework.","WTCOMTDM41.pdf","Chairman, Africa, Lusaka, Africa, Africa, Africa, Kananaskis, Canada, Wiseman, Nkuhlu, NEPAD, Secretariat, WTO, Africa"
"4334",4334,"67","67.      Professor Wiseman Nkuhlu said that the African Heads of State that were leading the initiative had met the G8 in Kananaskis a few days earlier. He had prepared an input that dealt with the market assess initiative of the NEPAD programme. He said that due to the time constraints he would not deal with why the WTO should be interested in development. He would rather give an input on the issues that NEPAD had been dealing with. He would deal with the introduction of NEPAD and the market access initiative and also look at the relationship that NEPAD had with the WTO and the type of support that it wished to get from the WTO. He said that NEPAD was a political process. After approval of the policy framework document by the OAU Summit in 2001, the Heads of State Implementation Committee of Fifteen, three from each of the OAU regions had been appointed. The nominations had come from the African Ambassadors in Addis Ababa and those fifteen countries became the members of the Heads of State Implementation Committee. The focus of the Heads of State Implementation Committee was twofold. One element of focus was to accelerate the social, economic and political reforms in Africa and the second was to strengthen Africa's capacity to negotiate at a global level, especially with respect to trade issues. The internal focus was mainly initiatives that were directed at consolidating democracy and sound economic management, and covered conflict prevention; management resolution; promotion of intra-Africa trade; strengthening the regional economic community structures; as well as further measures to deepen democracy and promote sound economic management. The Heads of State Implementation Committee believed that those kind of initiatives were necessary not to address the concerns of the international community, but to deal with the fact that for Africa to develop it needed in the first place to give security to its own people. There had to be political stability and Africans needed to feel that their leaders took democracy seriously and that the issues of corruption were addressed. The Heads of State                                                                                       WT/COMTD/M/41                                                                                              Page 19 Implementation Committee believed that it was time for African leaders to take leadership in ensuring that those measures were taken. Since the establishment of the Heads of State Implementation Committee in October 2001, the focus had been on the social, economic and political transformation processes that needed to be accelerated in the continent and the roles that political leaders needed to play in that. He said that he was pleased that the outcome of that was a far-reaching agreement on an instrument called ""A Declaration on Political Economic Cooperate and Financial Governance"" which was going to be presented by the Committee to the OAU as well as an ""African Peer Review Mechanism"". The African Peer Review Mechanism's primary purpose was to enable African countries to share experiences on good practices and reinforce those practices. It was less of a punitive mechanism, that African leaders had in mind. It was actually to say that, if for example Botswana had done well in providing a conducive environment in the mining sector and as a result made itself attractive to mining companies, other countries could learn from that. It was also to ensure that those experiences in macroeconomic management were shared.","WTCOMTDM41.pdf","Wiseman, Nkuhlu, Kananaskis, WTO, WTO, WTO, OAU, State, Implementation, Committee, of, Fifteen, OAU, Addis, Ababa, State, Implementation, Committee, State, Implementation, Committee, Africa, Africa, State, Implementation, Committee, Africa, Implementation, Committee, State, Implementation, Committee, Committee, OAU, Botswana"
"4335",4335,"68","68.      He went on to say that the second leg focused on the relationship between Africa and the international community, primarily on issues that required coordination such as market access issues, the resolution of conflicts, and issues involving the reforms of Official Development Assistance (ODA). After the approval of the framework document by the Heads of State in July 2001, the heads of state had made a presentation on NEPAD to the G8 in Genoa explaining that the African leaders were serious about accelerating the pace of reform in Africa to make it attractive to domestic and foreign investors, but for that to succeed it would need additional resources from the international community. The response of the G8 was that it would constitute a committee of personal representatives, which would prepare a response to that presentation. The Steering Committee which supported the Heads of State Implementation Committee had spent from October 2001 to May 2002, providing inputs and having interaction with the G8 personal representatives to ensure that there was a common understanding on what Africa saw as priorities and how African leaders felt that those priorities should be addressed. That interaction made a significant input in the preparation of the response by the G8 personal representatives. The response was presented in Kananaskis in the form of a G8 Africa action Plan. That Plan covered all the priority areas as identified by the Heads of State Implementation Committee. The main point that the African leaders had been emphasizing was the need to build a new partnership that was anchored on mutual respect and mutual accountability. Not the kind of relationship that countries had then, where when a problem arose, it was only the LCD's that needed to reform. When things went wrong it was rare that it was the developed countries which had to take corrective action. It was that balanced partnership that African leaders were hoping for. He said that it also had, to a large extent, been achieved in the Kananaskis declaration. If one looked at the number of interactions that had taken place between African leaders and the G8 leaders during the last year, an agreement had been reached that those interactions were going to continue over the following years. There had been a commitment to accept NEPAD as the framework that would form the relationship between Africa and the developed countries. There had also been the commitment that no country that was genuinely committed to poverty reduction, good governance and economic reform, would be denied the chance to achieve the millenium development goals.","WTCOMTDM41.pdf","Africa, ODA, Genoa, Africa, Steering, Committee, State, Implementation, Committee, Africa, Kananaskis, Africa, State, Implementation, Committee, Kananaskis, Africa"
"4336",4336,"69","69.      He continued by saying that according to their statements, President Obasanjo, President Boreflecker, President Mbeki and President Watt, were satisfied with the response because it was an initial response, a point of departure. What the response said was that the invitation to change the partnership had been accepted and that new partnership would be based on certain principles and that as a start, the G8 was going to support actions and projects in order to kick start the programmes. The content of the programmes was still to be worked out. For example, there was a long list of actions under peace and stability, economic growth, and trade, and the next stage was to work out the detailed projects under each of those as well as the costing of those projects. That was possibly where the real test was going to be, in terms of working out those details and negotiating the support of the programmes. He said that the response from the African leaders was expected to be more concrete than it had been. That was a matter of concern. He said that for priorities like WT/COMTD/M/41 Page 20 universal primary education the costing had been made and what was required was a project such as the one that had been recently completed by the World Bank. That report went into detail country but country and it could have been taken as a starting-point to provide knowledge about how much money was needed to enable African countries to achieve universal primary education. NEPAD had worked out a detailed programme with the Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO) which clearly showed what should happen in each country under four programmes. NEPAD believed that there was enough material in that area to go further than they had done. He concluded by saying that the Heads of States Implementation Committee was a committee of the OAU, President Obasanjo, as Chairman of that Committee, would soon report to the OAU in full. The question of how the response of the G8 would be followed up was a matter for the OAU. A start had been made and like all projects of that kind it could have been better, however he believed that the foundations that were there were better than before.","WTCOMTDM41.pdf","Obasanjo, Boreflecker, Mbeki, Watt, World, Bank, Food, and, Agricultural, Organization, FAO, Heads, of, States, Implementation, Committee, OAU, Obasanjo, Chairman, Committee, OAU, OAU"

The representative of Mauritius said that his delegation appreciated what Professor Nkuhlu had said about the need for a new partnership based on mutual respect and mutual accountability. He referred to an article that had appeared in a publication the previous week, where a commentator had made disparaging remarks about NEPAD. It was compared to a ""knee pad"", suggesting that it was a symbol of capitulation. Such remarks about a bold and ambitious programme could do a lot of harm. That was why his delegation were gratified when Professor Nkuhlu had said that the G8 recognised that NEPAD was a bold and clear sighted vision of Africa's development.","WTCOMTDM41.pdf","Mauritius, Nkuhlu, Nkuhlu, Africa"
"4340",4340,"72","72.      Professor Nkuhlu in response to the delegation of Ghana's question about the WTO's relationship with NEPAD, said that the major issue for NEPAD was the issue of coordination. The primary support was in the area of capacity building. It was important that, in a complex environment where African countries had liberalised and were continuing to do so, the imbalances in the capacity to negotiate and defending positions that they wished to take remained a matter of concern. The WTO's role would be to provide technical support and capacity building. The NEPAD process on the African side was strengthening the political leadership. There was nothing more important than the issues related to trade to enable Africa to industrialise and become a meaningful player in the global economy. That was an area where NEPAD needed capacity and better coordination on the African side. NEPAD was not taking over the role of the individual countries that negotiated those positions, it needed better coordination and insurance that on the African side there was stronger coordinated political leadership. He thanked the delegation of Mauritius for stating the correction that NEPAD was not ""Knee-pad"".","WTCOMTDM41.pdf","Nkuhlu, Ghana, WTO, WTO, Africa, Mauritius"

The objectives of the Agreement were:                                                                                    WT/COMTD/M/41                                                                                           Page 21                 (i)     to promote through the expansion of trade the harmonious development of                         the economic relations between India and Sri Lanka;                 (ii)    to provide fair conditions of competition for trade between India and Sri                         Lanka;                 (iii)   for the contracting parties to pay due regard to the principle of reciprocity in                         their implementation of the Agreement; and                 (iv)    to contribute, to the harmonious development and expansion of world trade                         by the removal of barriers to trade.","WTCOMTDM41.pdf","Sri, Lanka, India, FTA, India, Sri, Lanka, India, Sri, Lanka, India, Sri, Lanka"

As the respective phase-out schedule of each country was concerned, zero duty would be applied by both governments to some items from the date of entry of the Agreement. For the remaining items, except for items contained in the negative lists, tariffs would be gradually reduced to zero per cent by the Government of India within three years from the entry into force of the Agreement. The Agreement provided for an eight year period for reducing the tariffs to zero level for the Government of Sri Lanka. The different time schedule for phasing out tariffs as well as the respective negative lists, reflected the recognition in the Agreement of the different levels of economic development in the two countries. He said that, with respect to Article XVII, the Agreement would enter into force on the 30th day after the parties had notified each other that their respective constitutional requirements and procedures had been completed. Following completion of those requirements and procedures by both the Governments, the FTA had entered into force on 15 December 2001 and had been notified to the WTO pursuant to the Decision of 28 November 1979, under the GATT on Differential and More Favourable Treatment, Reciprocity and Fuller Participation of Developing Countries, known as the ""Enabling Clause"". The Governments of India and Sri Lanka believed that the establishment and promotion of FTAs would help the development of their respective national economies and strengthen intra-regional economic cooperation as well as world trade.","WTCOMTDM41.pdf","India, Sri, Lanka, India, India, Sri, Lanka, FTA, WTO, GATT, India, Sri, Lanka"

His delegation understood that there were constraints in scheduling the meetings and he suggested that the Secretariat bear those constraints in mind when drafting the agenda, instead of having to resort to last minute changes. He had noticed that technical cooperation had been taking up a few hours of the last two CTD meetings. It was important for delegations that the procedure for discussing various agenda items be made smooth. He suggested that one Session of the CTD session be allocated fully to technical cooperation. It would then be easier to know when the items would come up for discussion and the concerned officers could be present. In some missions various agenda items were dealt with by different officers.

The Chairman said that the first sub-item under item C on Technical Cooperation and Training was a statement by the Chairman of the Committee on Budget, Finance and Administration (BFA) in relation to pledges announced and payments received to finance the implementation of the Coordinated WTO Secretariat Annual Technical Assistance Plan. Further to the decision of the General Council in December 2001, the CTD and the Committee on Budget, Finance and Administration (BFA) were jointly responsible for monitoring the level of resources and expenses related to the execution of the Plan. Mr. McMillan, Chairman of the Committee on Budget, Finance and Administration, would therefore give a report to the CTD.","WTCOMTDM41.pdf","Chairman, Chairman, Committee, on, Budget, ,, Finance, and, Administration, BFA, WTO, Secretariat, General, Council, CTD, Committee, on, Budget, ,, Finance, and, Administration, BFA, McMillan, Chairman, Committee, on, Budget, ,, Finance, and, Administration, CTD"

The reason behind the document's (WT/COMTD/N/16) late circulation was that his delegation had submitted the document after the first version of the agenda had been issued. It could therefore not have been included in the original version of the agenda. In view of that, his delegation had no problem in having the item included on the agenda for the next meeting of the CTD for further discussion. His delegation looked forward to clarification and consultation with the Secretariat with respect to the point made by the representative of the United States as to whether the FTA between India and Sri Lanka should be notified to the CRTA. He said that the last time that an agreement had been notified to the CTD under the ""Enabling Clause"", his delegation had raised some questions which remained unanswered. Firstly, his delegation wanted the full text of the Africa Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA) which had been notified and not made available at that meeting. Only the list of items on which some concessions were being made had been circulated at the meeting. He asked whether the full text of the AGOA had been received, and if so, if it had been circulated to Members.","WTCOMTDM41.pdf","India, United, States, Pakistan, CTD, Secretariat, United, States, FTA, India, Sri, Lanka, CRTA, CTD, AGOA, AGOA, Members"

"4359",4359,"9","9.       Mr. McMillan, chairman of the Committee on Budget, Finance and Administration, said that he would report on funds received against the Doha Development Agenda Global Trust Fund (DDAGTF). He recalled that the General Council on 19 and 20 December had approved the terms of reference for the DDAGTF which were contained in the report of the BFA (WT/BFA/56). In particular, the General Council had approved a target at that point of CHF15 million for the Trust Fund for the year 2002. That target was phased in three steps. First, there was a target of 25 per cent of that funding ,about CHF3.75 million, to be deposited in the WTO bank account by the end of 2001. The second milestone of 75 per cent, or CHF11.25 million, should have been met in March 2002. At the end of June the full amount of CHF15 million should have been received. He said that the BFA also had created a buffer account of a further CHF1 million out of the 2000 surplus account to cover temporary shortfalls in the Trust Fund in case the contributions did not keep pace with the expenses of the various activities. Since then the CTD had approved the Coordinated Annual Technical Assistance Plan for 2002. The Secretariat had estimated in that Plan a total cost of CHF17.3 million after the deduction of an ambitious amount of cost sharing of CHF5 million with other institutions, including UNCTAD and a number of regional development banks. The Pledging Conference held on 11 March had produced an unprecedented level of pledges from Members.1 Donors had announced pledges totalling CHF21.3 million to the DDAGTF for 2002 and a further CHF 4 million of related funding earmarked to specific objectives. He said because that had been put in place almost three months into 2002, it had taken the BFA a little time to deliver on its commitments. Since the last time he had reported to the CTD on 25 April 2002, the situation had dramatically improved and the June         1             The precise figures were available in document WT/BFA/SPEC/77 which had been distributed to the CTD. WT/COMTD/M/41 Page 4 deadline had almost been met. Document WT/BFA/SPEC/77 showed that the WTO had received a total of CHF14.7 million by 25 June. That change over the last three months was highly encouraging. He thanked all donors that had helped meet that target.","WTCOMTDM41.pdf","McMillan, chairman, Committee, on, Budget, ,, Finance, and, Administration, Doha, Development, Agenda, Global, Trust, Fund, General, Council, BFA, General, Council, WTO, BFA, Trust, Fund, CTD, Secretariat, UNCTAD, Members, BFA, CTD, CTD, WTO"

The representative of India had asked how the ceiling quotas for industrial products would be allocated. She assumed that, within the quota, the preferential duty would be applicable so that once the quota was exceeded the normal rate of duty would be applicable. That was why there was a GSP ceiling. However, there were different ways to allocate that quota. It could be allocated on a first come first served basis, which meant that the country which exported first would fill the quota or it could be allocated by reserving country quotas. She sought clarification from the delegation of Japan as to whether the Government of Japan allocated what she assumed was a global quota on a first come first served basis or whether each beneficiary country had a quota which was determined based on the country's export performance during previous years. Her delegation did not expect those questions to be responded to at that meeting but wished to get further information at a subsequent meeting.","WTCOMTDM41.pdf","Sri, Lanka, India, India, GSP, Japan, Japan"

"4384",4384,"10","10.      The Director-General, Dr. Supachai, said that technical assistance was important and was one of the four pillars that he had established for his work as Director-General of the WTO. He had taken that decision knowing the vital importance that effective trade-related technical assistance (TRTA) and capacity building played in trade development. DDG Dr. Rana would supervise the area of technical assistance and capacity building. However he, as Director-General, would personally continue to stay in touch with the topic and conduct his own consultations and deliberations on it. The 2003 TA Plan was a key element in his evolving thoughts on the subject of technical assistance and capacity building and it was based in part on consultations with Members on how WTO technical assistance could be better structured to meet present priorities and future challenges. He said he would share several points influencing his thoughts on technical assistance after which the Director of the Technical Cooperation Division, Mr. Osakwe would present the details of the Plan. First, what Members needed to develop up front was a clear strategic sense of the areas of WTO's technical assistance and capacity building. One question was where WTO's comparative advantage could best be applied. The Secretariat could not perform its duties in areas where it did not possess the full expertise or lacked the resources to do so. He believed that the skills of the Secretariat staff would be best utilised in delivering technical assistance to build effective capacity for trade negotiations. However, as that was not the totality of all technical assistance, there was a need to coordinate WTO's skills with those of other relevant multilateral agencies to deliver technical assistance for the understanding of the rules and their implementation. In that regard, he placed high premium on collaboration with UNCTAD, the International Trade Centre (ITC), the UNDP, the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the World Customs Organization (WCO), the International Standardizing Bodies, and others. Another key element was technical assistance for the construction of commercial infrastructure, which would enable developing and least-developed countries (LDCs) to draw on the benefits of improved market access and the open, rules-based trading system. After Members had agreed on certain market access measures it was not automatic that poor countries, especially the LDCs would be able to make use of the opportunities offered to them. There was therefore a need to build commercial infrastructure. The WTO had to seek coordination with other development institutions such as the World Bank, the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and the United Nations Industrial Development Organisation (UNIDO) in that area. The Secretariat would principally focus on what it did best, which was to provide technical assistance to WT/COMTD/M/42 Page 4 build effective capacity for negotiations. The Secretariat would continue to coordinate the various phases of technical assistance that went beyond the Doha Development Agenda (DDA) period of negotiations.","WTCOMTDM42.pdf","Director-General, Supachai, Director-General, WTO, Rana, Director-General, Members, WTO, Director, Technical, Cooperation, Division, Osakwe, Members, WTO, WTO, Secretariat, Secretariat, WTO, UNCTAD, International, Trade, Centre, ITC, UNDP, World, Bank, International, Monetary, Fund, IMF, World, Customs, Organization, WCO, International, Standardizing, Bodies, Members, WTO, World, Bank, United, Nations, Development, Programme, UNDP, United, Nations, Industrial, Development, Organisation, UNIDO, Secretariat, Secretariat, Doha, Development, Agenda, DDA"

"4394",4394,"109","109.    The Chairman said that it was too early to prepare a draft Annual Report of the CTD, particularly as the discussion on some items had not been completed. Furthermore, the Sub-Committee on LDCs had scheduled a Meeting for 7th November, and Members might wish to await the outcome of that Meeting before finalizing the Annual Report of the CTD. It had already been agreed that the Committee meet again to discuss the Technical Assistance Plan for 2003 on 11 November 2002. The Committee could possibly discuss the Draft report at that meeting, if time permitted. He said that he wished to provide Members with the opportunity to inform him of any particular item they might wish to include in the CTD Annual Report or to discuss any aspect of a possible Report.","WTCOMTDM42.pdf","Chairman, CTD, Members, CTD, Committee, Committee, Members, CTD"
"4395",4395,"11","11.      Second, he continued by saying that the LDCs would continue to receive focus in WTO's Technical Assistance Plans. The 2003 TA Plan proposed several new products to take account of the LDC's needs. At the same time, it had to be kept in mind that there were several regional challenges to which the WTO needed to respond. Other countries in developing country regions had needs as critical as those of the LDCs. Such regions included countries in Africa, South and Central Asia, and the Caribbean. The Doha Ministerial Declaration established a Work Programme on Small Economies and there were capacity constrained missions in Central Asia and Eastern Europe and the transition economies. Those were all challenges and priorities that the WTO had endeavoured to respond to in the 2003 TA Plan and the Secretariat would attempt to continue to improve its activities in those areas. Third, to achieve universality of the organization, there was a need to attach priority attention to acceding countries. The 2003 TA Plan addressed acceding country technical assistance priorities and it was in that context that the Secretariat would focus on the LDCs' Work Programme. Mr. Molander, Ambassador of Sweden and Chairman of the Sub-Committee on LDCs, was working hard in that regard and had the full support of the Secretariat. Fourth, based on consultations that he had held, he realised that recipients of technical assistance attached great importance to systematic, cumulative and sustainable capacity building. In that regard, a significant improvement had been made in the 2003 TA Plan. New products had been designed to reflect Members' needs including intensive short trade policy courses, training of senior government officials on the areas of negotiations within the DDA stemming from the Doha Ministerial Conference, consolidation and extension of the internship system and training-of-trainers programmes. The work of the Technical Cooperation Division, the Training Institute and the Trade Policy Review Division, which had a high technical assistance component, had been properly interfaced and he would continue to work on the improvement of that interfacing.","WTCOMTDM42.pdf","LDCs, WTO, LDC, WTO, Africa, Central, Asia, Caribbean, Central, Asia, Eastern, Europe, WTO, Secretariat, Secretariat, Work, Programme, Molander, Ambassador, Sweden, Chairman, Secretariat, Members, DDA, Technical, Cooperation, Division, Training, Institute, Trade, Policy, Review, Division"
"4396",4396,"110","110.     The representative of the European Communities said that he supported the proposal by the Chairman as it was important that the Committee had the results of the discussions in the Sub- Committee on LDCs as well as the continued discussions on the 2003 TA Plan before it before finalizing the report. He was concerned that there might not be enough time for a discussion of the draft Annual Report of the CTD on 11 November.","WTCOMTDM42.pdf","European, Communities, Chairman, Committee, Sub, -, Committee, CTD"

"4398",4398,"112","112.    The Chairman said that the delegation of Croatia had suggested a topic for discussion, and Members had agreed to its inclusion. The item related to a Ministerial Trade Conference held in Zagreb, Croatia, in June 2002.","WTCOMTDM42.pdf","Chairman, Croatia, Members, Zagreb, Croatia"
"4399",4399,"113","113.     The representative of Croatia said that he was making the statement on behalf of the Governments of Croatia, Lithuania and Moldova. Those Governments wished to thank the Secretariat for its report on the WTO Ministerial Trade Conference for Central and Southeast Europe held in Zagreb, Croatia, on 11 and 12 June 2002, contained in the document WT/COMTD/41 of 11 September 2002. He also thanked the WTO Secretariat for the preparation and organization of that important and useful event. His delegation had carefully read the Secretariat report, which was useful and contained accurate information reflecting in general the discussions held during the Conference. He had also noted the clarification that the report had been prepared under the Secretariat's own responsibility, and was without prejudice to the positions of Members or to their rights and obligations under the WTO. In that respect, the delegations he represented stressed that without having any intention to comment on the content of the report, they felt it necessary to highlight a specific issue that had not been included in the Report, but which was of significant importance to their Governments. That point had been raised and emphasized by the representatives of the three Governments in practically all session of the conference in Zagreb and particularly in the session related to the DDA negotiation round. It related to their Governments respective approaches and positions in the current negotiating round, which were strongly influenced by the fact that they had only recently acceded to the WTO. In that process, they had made extensive market-access commitments, which had been recognized in paragraph 9 of the Doha Ministerial Declaration. They therefore believed that that fact should be seriously taken into account and be adequately reflected in the DDA negotiations, including in different modalities for future market-access commitments. They had, together with a number of other Members, consistently raised that issue in other bodies. However, as the WTO Ministerial Conference held in Zagreb was an activity organized under a programme that fell within the competence of the CTD, they felt it necessary to state for the record that that specific issue had also been strongly emphasized in the Conference by senior high-level officials of their Governments.

"4400",4400,"114","114.    Mr. Low, Director, Development and Economic Research Division, said that the point made had been well taken.

"4401",4401,"115","115.    The representative of the United States said that her delegation had recently circulated a document on capacity building considerations relating to transparency in government procurement (WT/WGTGP/W/34) to the Working Group on Transparency in Government Procurement. That document set out a series of questions for Members' consideration relating to the practical implications of building transparency into government procurement systems. Her delegation offered that paper as a contribution to the CTD's review of technical assistance and capacity building as well.

"4402",4402,"116","116.    The Chairman asked the Secretariat to look into that matter and reminded delegations that the next formal session of the CTD was scheduled for Monday, 11 November 2002 at 3 p.m.                                              __________","WTCOMTDM42.pdf","Chairman, Secretariat, CTD"
"4403",4403,"12","12.      His fifth point was that he agreed with Members that priority should be accorded to the quality, not the quantity, of the technical assistance activities. Consequently, the number of discrete activities was being reduced to improve quality and increase the coverage of each. There was a tighter linkage between national and regional activities. Mr. Rolian, Director, Technical Cooperation Audit had developed new tools and processes for evaluating WTO technical assistance and training activities. In the course of the implementation of the annual technical assistance plans, Mr. Rolian would provide periodic reports to the Membership. The sixth point, and perhaps the greatest challenge was the demand for result-oriented coordination with other agencies, bilateral donors and coordination within recipient countries. There was a need to proceed with coordination and coherence with a sense of urgency. The process of building strategic partnerships and building synergies with agencies, donors and recipients needed to continue. There had been modest progress, but more needed to be done. The Joint Integrated Technical Assistance Programme (JITAP) review had yielded important insights. That success should be built upon. The Integrated Framework (IF) was the hope for medium to long-term trade development. Modest successes had been achieved in countries like Cambodia. In addition to the three pilot countries, the IF was being extended to 11 more LDCs. That extension was being closely reviewed, and he was in consultation with several Members, such as H.E. Mr. Ould Mohamed Lemine, Ambassador of Mauritania, to examine current challenges and determine how best to address those challenges. He said that concerns had been expressed with respect to the IF programme and he was doing his best to consult with both recipient and donor countries. The Heads of IF Agencies had agreed to meet in 2003 to address several issues. The speed of implementation of the IF needed to be accelerated if it was to remain relevant. The follow-up on the results of the diagnostic trade integration studies had to be taken more seriously and be based on clear procedures. He said that he would report to the Membership on that in the near future. The support of development agencies and bilateral donors was critical if the IF was to work as designed.

"4404",4404,"13","13.      He went on to assure Members that the Secretariat's technical assistance objectives were not only focused on the next WTO Ministerial Conference in Cancun. His objective as Director-General was to establish an architecture of WTO technical assistance that would last beyond the Cancun Ministerial Conference and the DDA negotiations. He believed that the process had begun well and with Members' support the objective would be achieved. What the Secretariat needed to do was to consolidate and improve what it was doing, refine technical assistance and training materials, and achieve sustainability and cumulation. He concluded by assuring Members that, together with senior management, he would work to ensure improved coordination within the Secretariat, using the Technical Assistance Management Committee, to address the incidence of problems such as ad hoc activities, and improve the implementation and delivery of technical assistance. In that regard, the support of technical assistance recipients would be required. His report, as mandated by Ministers under paragraph 41 of the Doha Ministerial Declaration, would be circulated to the membership by mid-November. Indications showed that the Secretariat was on track to effectively respond to the technical cooperation and capacity building commitments in the Doha Ministerial Declaration. The remaining months would give the Secretariat time to catch up on the work. He expressed his appreciation to the donors for establishing predictability in the WTO technical assistance funding. He also thanked the recipient countries for the clarity of their priorities, which laid the basis for a significantly improved 2003 TA Plan. He invited Mr. Osakwe, Director of the Technical Cooperation Division, to present the process for compiling the 2003 TA Plan, the main features of the requests and the key elements of the 2003 TA Plan.","WTCOMTDM42.pdf","Members, Secretariat, WTO, Cancun, Director-General, WTO, Cancun, Ministerial, Conference, DDA, Members, Secretariat, Members, Secretariat, Technical, Assistance, Management, Committee, Secretariat, Secretariat, WTO, Osakwe, Director, Technical, Cooperation, Division"
"4405",4405,"14","14.      Mr. Osakwe, Director, Technical Cooperation Division, began by apologising for the late circulation of the 2003 TA Plan. He said that what he would cover, would build on the over-arching points made by the Director-General. First, he would discuss the process of the 2003 TA Plan, the features of Members' requests and the design of the 2003 TA Plan. He would then go on to mention the lessons drawn from the delivery of the 2002 TA Plan as well as the principles applied to the 2003 TA Plan which had been slightly modified from those applied in previous years. Finally, he would deal with the issue of internal Secretariat co-ordination. He said that the Secretariat had paid attention to process because there had been criticism that the Secretariat was insensitive, that it did not pay enough attention to the priorities communicated by Members and that WTO technical assistance was Secretariat supply-side driven. To address that problem, the Secretariat had entered into formal communication with Members over a five-month period to obtain prioritised requests of individual discrete TA activities. He recalled that the Secretariat had made the first call for inputs for the 2003 TA Plan in the CTD in April. That initial call had been followed by several reminders through Committee Chairpersons. In addition, the Director-General had issued a letter on 28 June 2002 to all trade ministers with a copy to all development ministers requesting their communication of TA priorities. Every request received had been acknowledged and the Secretariat had contacted all of the 118 Members and Observers that had communicated requests. 1038 requests had been received from 118 Members and Observers. Of those requests, 613 were from 66 developing countries, 227 were from 25 LDCs and 198 of them were from 27 acceding countries. All the requests had been filed in a database which was open to verification by Members. The greatest demand for technical assistance related to the Singapore issues followed by capacity building issues. The capacity building issues encompassed one-week short trade policy courses at the national level, regional short trade policy courses of a two week duration, internships within the WTO Secretariat and other elements. Other areas in which TA was highly demanded included services, rules and agriculture.","WTCOMTDM42.pdf","Osakwe, Director, Director-General, Members, Secretariat, Secretariat, Secretariat, Members, WTO, Secretariat, Secretariat, Members, Secretariat, CTD, Committee, Chairpersons, Director-General, Secretariat, Members, Members, Members, Singapore, WTO, Secretariat"
"4406",4406,"15","15.      He went on to say that the 2003 TA Plan focused on three objectives. One was that the Secretariat sought to deliver technical assistance to build capacity for effective participation in negotiations. That was an area in which the WTO Secretariat had competence and he was confident that it could deliver that assistance. New products had been designed and arrangements had been set up which would be confirmed in the Director-General's report required by paragraph 41 of the Doha Ministerial Declaration. The second objective was technical assistance to build capacity for implementing WTO agreements. It was an area where the WTO would be delivering technical assistance in cooperation with others. For instance, in the area of standards the WTO would WT/COMTD/M/42 Page 6 collaborate with international standardising bodies and in the area of customs valuation and trade facilitation with the World Customs Organisation, UNCTAD and the International Trade Centre (ITC). The third objective was technical assistance for trade integration and commercial infrastructure an area where the Secretariat felt unable to deliver technical assistance. However, as had been mentioned by the Director-General, the WTO would pursue co-ordination with development agencies, such as the UNDP, the World Bank, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), UNCTAD and several other organisations. The Secretariat would deliver 441 activities of which 251 would be national activities directly linked to 190 specialized regional activities within the 2003 TA Plan. Where Members had made requests but the Secretariat was unable to organize national activities due to a variety of reasons they would be able to benefit from regional programmes. When considering the 2003 TA Plan he urged Members to look at the national activities from which they would also benefit, in conjunction with the regional activities from which they would benefit. They were inseparable. The second axis of the Plan was that a formal channel of communication had been established with the Development Assistance Committee (DAC) of the OECD to relate to several bilateral donors who had set aside resources and made logistic arrangements to deliver technical assistance complimentary to that of the WTO. Many bilateral donors were in contact with the Secretariat in order to reinforce the Secretariat's work by filling the gaps with regard to the priorities communicated by Members. That was integral to the 2003 TA Plan. There was inter-agency coordination following consultations the WTO Secretariat had had with the World Bank. The World Bank lead the process in coherence and co-ordination with other agencies. The WTO Secretariat had established a first understanding with regional development banks which in many respects were twice as large as the WTO Secretariat and possessed more resources. The regional development banks had confirmed co-sharing arrangements by which they would be financing and providing logistic support for a lot of the technical assistance that was to be delivered. The WTO Secretariat was grateful to the six major regional development banks and was beginning to benefit from its cooperation with them. A key part which would add value to the 2003 TA Plan was the idea of trade clinics that had been introduced by the Director-General. The Director-General had been concerned that a plan might be unable to relate and respond rapidly to Members that had difficulties in a variety of areas, for instance in implementing their obligations within transitional time frames, with respect to institutional capacity-building, and domestic legislation. The trade clinics involved specialised teams of WTO resource persons responding quickly to specific trade-related problems of beneficiary countries. That would help to decrease acute implementation related problems for example. Finally, there was the Doha Development Agenda Management Database, which would be critical to the management of the range of demands coming from Members in relation to what the Secretariat could deliver alone and with regard to assistance that the Secretariat needed to deliver in co-ordination and coherence with other agencies.","WTCOMTDM42.pdf","Secretariat, WTO, Secretariat, Director-General, WTO, WTO, WTO, World, Customs, Organisation, UNCTAD, International, Trade, Centre, ITC, Secretariat, Director-General, WTO, UNDP, World, Bank, Organisation, for, Economic, Co-operation, OECD, UNCTAD, Secretariat, Members, Secretariat, Members, Development, Assistance, Committee, OECD, WTO, Secretariat, Secretariat, Members, WTO, Secretariat, World, Bank, World, Bank, WTO, Secretariat, WTO, Secretariat, WTO, Secretariat, Director-General, Director-General, Members, WTO, Doha, Development, Agenda, Management, Database, Members, Secretariat, Secretariat"
"4407",4407,"16","16.       He continued by saying that the Training Institute, the Technical Cooperation Division and the Statistics Division had developed a comprehensive tool kit for trade negotiators. The Secretariat hoped to present it before the end of October 2002. The tool kit would enable Members to manipulate tariffs in the Integrated Database and the Consolidated Tariffs Schedule (CTS). Members would also be able to perform their own analyses of textural proposals that other Members had put forward. That had been achieved through funding assistance from the Department for International Development (DFID) of the United Kingdom and in cooperation with the Inter-American Development Bank and the Secretariat for Economic Integration of Central America (SIECA) that had done previous work in the area. The Secretariat had finally realised how to structure internships. Internships were high quality and high cost capacity building. There were four types of internships. The first was the regular internships where interns were recruited directly by Divisions. The second was the ""Dutch internship system"" where the intern was employed as WTO staff for a two-year period but was prevented from staying on to work in the Secretariat beyond that period. The intern had to return and support the administration in their country. The third and new internship programme, which would begin in January 2003, was the system of interns for regional co-ordinators. The intern would be designated by the regional group and paid by the Secretariat. There would be seven ""regional"" interns on a six-month rotating basis. The intern would be based with their missions in Geneva and would                                                                                     WT/COMTD/M/42                                                                                             Page 7 cover WTO meetings. The final type of internship followed the regional co-ordinators internship model. Several donors including Japan and the United Kingdom had offered resources to enable the Secretariat to offer internships to about 14 Members over the following months. They included capacity constrained developing countries, LDCs as well as low income transition economies. There was a DDA global training course. Another vital TA product for 2003, which would be subject to a separate presentation to Members, was the regional seminars which the Secretariat would conduct configured around the more than 120 existing reference centers which were the most successful of the WTO's technical assistance activities. Those seminars would include the training of representatives from both collaborating academic institutions, and finance and commerce ministries in order to continue to seek the mainstreaming objective. The programme would be circulated to Members for comments before being implemented in March 2003. He continued by saying that in the previous week, the Director-General of the WTO and the President of the World Bank, Mr. Wolfensohn had launched a standards trade development facility to which the World Bank had already contributed US$300 000 out of its development grant facility, which would be increased in 2003. The Secretariat was proposing, in the 2003 TA Plan, that the WTO make a complimentary contribution of CHF 100 000. It would be a joint World Bank and WTO facility in collaboration with the three major standardising institutions to address the significant problem with regard to the export quality and standards of products exported from developing and least-developed countries. Mr. Wolter, Director of the Agriculture and Commodities Division, and Mrs. Gretchen Stanton were to speak on that at a meeting to be arranged. That was the sum of the new products.","WTCOMTDM42.pdf","Training, Institute, Technical, Cooperation, Division, Statistics, Division, Secretariat, Members, Integrated, Database, Members, Members, Department, for, International, Development, DFID, United, Kingdom, Inter-American, Development, Bank, Secretariat, for, Economic, Integration, of, Central, America, Secretariat, WTO, Secretariat, Secretariat, Geneva, WTO, Japan, United, Kingdom, Secretariat, Members, DDA, Members, Secretariat, WTO, Members, Director-General, WTO, World, Bank, Wolfensohn, World, Bank, Secretariat, WTO, World, Bank, WTO, Wolter, Director, Agriculture, and, Commodities, Division, Gretchen, Stanton"
"4408",4408,"17","17.      He further spoke about a point that had been made clear in the priorities communicated by Members, and that was the need for a higher training component in the technical assistance activities. When communicating their training priorities, many Members had pointed out that they preferred training courses of a one to three-week duration rather than longer courses because of the limited human resources some ministries possessed. In order to respond to the need for institutional capacity building with the focus on courses of short-term duration, the Secretariat had included 77 training courses of short-term duration for 2003. That was the largest number ever included in a technical assistance plan. The two 12-week regional trade policy courses in Nairobi and Casablanca were being evaluated by the WTO TA Audit. The Secretariat would issue a report concerning its future policy and funding proposals in that area after the completion of the evaluation. He concluded by mentioning the lessons learnt when drawing up the 2003 TA Plan. Demand was greater than supply. The Secretariat therefore had a duty to sort and rationalise the requests. Recipient countries were calling for more emphasis on trade integration, referring to the type of technical assistance that had been mentioned by the Director-General, that was TA to build infrastructure. The Secretariat had learnt that all activities would come to nothing in the recipient countries if technical assistance was not an integral part of the overall development strategy's of the country or of its Poverty Reduction Strategy Papers (PRSP) as appropriate. The former lesson that co-ordination challenges remained acute had been reinforced. The Director-General had recommitted himself to that and it would be tackled in co-ordination with recipients and donors. Strategic partnerships and synergies were indispensable and the Director-General would pursue them both within the JITAP, a key area of synergy, and the IF. The Bretton Woods Institutions, the World Bank and the IMF, were important and without them little would be achieved. He reiterated the point made by the Director-General that there were principle challenges in Africa, South and Central Asia, the Caribbean, LDCs and acceding countries. There was a need to accelerate the implementation of the IF and Members needed to be aware that the Secretariat was dealing with the issue of ad hoc activities. He said that Members had asked the Secretariat to ensure that technical assistance and market access were complimentary, not substitutes. With respect to principles, he reconfirmed that the 2003 TA Plan had been designed on the basis of recipient-determined priorities. The Secretariat had sorted and rationalised the requests to something manageable. It had not proceeded on a strictly demand driven path, because if it had there would be 1038 activities in the 2003 TA Plan.","WTCOMTDM42.pdf","Members, Members, Secretariat, Nairobi, Casablanca, WTO, TA, Audit, Secretariat, Secretariat, Director-General, Secretariat, Director-General, Director-General, World, Bank, IMF, Director-General, Africa, Central, Asia, Caribbean, LDCs, Members, Secretariat, Members, Secretariat, Secretariat"

"4410",4410,"19","19.      DDG Mr. Abbot said that he had been asked to provide an overview of the Secretariat's cost estimates for the proposed WTO technical assistance and training activities for 2003. He made it clear that he was not making any judgement as to whether Members should be spending more or less money on technical assistance. Members had the right to accept, reject or modify the 2003 TA Plan according to their wishes. His mission was to tell Members what the 2003 TA Plan would cost. Adjustments to the cost estimates would have to be made if Members made changes to the 2003 TA Plan. In other words, he would provide information as to what a pledging conference would have to deliver if the Secretariat was to execute the draft 2003 TA Plan. He hoped that the figures he was going to present to Members, taken together with the details provided in the documents related to the Coordinated WTO Secretariat Annual Technical Assistance Plan for 2003 (WT/COMTD/W/104, WT/COMTD/W/104/Add.1) and to the activities of the WTO Training Institute in 2003 (WT/COMTD/W/103) would provide Members with the basic information they required to prepare their authorities' positions in advance of a pledging conference for the Doha Development Agenda Global Trust Fund (DDAGTF) that might be held later in 2002. The problems associated with the creation of the DDAGTF in the previous year were an element of the past. The Committee on Budget, Finance and Administration (BFA) would take the results of the discussions in the CTD into consideration later in the year. Adjustments would be made to the financing, if necessary, and the Committee on BFA would then make a recommendation to the General Council on a target amount for the 2003 DDAGTF.","WTCOMTDM42.pdf","Abbot, Secretariat, WTO, Members, Members, Members, Members, Secretariat, Members, WTO, Secretariat, WTO, Training, Institute, Members, Doha, Development, Agenda, Global, Trust, Fund, Committee, on, Budget, ,, Finance, and, Administration, BFA, CTD, Committee, BFA, General, Council"

"4412",4412,"20","20.      He further said that the cost estimates he was going to present to Members would be fully adjusted to reflect the results of Members' discussions. Members had received document CRP(02)/3 containing the financial implications of the 2003 TA Plan. For costing purposes, the 441 activities covered by the 2003 TA Plan had been regrouped into three categories: the Geneva-based activities, regional activities and national activities. Geneva-based activities were held at the WTO headquarters and would involve either Geneva-based delegates or a mixture of Geneva-based and capital-based officials, as well as some outside speakers. Geneva-based activities for capital-based delegates were something the Secretariat wished to do more of, but they were costly as participants travelling costs had to be financed. Regional activities involved several WTO Members or observers and also involved the financing, travelling and subsistence costs for the participants. The national activities took place in a given country and required the financing of WTO staff members’ travel. Globally, the Secretariat had arrived at a figure for those 2003 activities of between CHF 30 and 31 million. The total comprised of three elements. First, the total estimate for activities was CHF 35,571,750. Second, a reduction on that expected from cost sharing arrangements with individual countries and other organisations was expected to amount to CHF 5,073,755. That resulted in a net total of between CHF 30 and 31 million. In arriving at those figures, the Secretariat had applied standard cost methodologies assigning different standard costs for a one day activity for one person depending upon whether the event was classed as a national activity (CHF 1,850), a regional activity (CHF 1,150), or an activity in Geneva headquarters (CHF 2,700). Some of the figures had increased and others decreased from the previous year, and he would explain the reasons. Three additional elements had been identified and their costs had been estimated in order to arrive at the total cost of the package. The first was the future activities of the WTO Training Institute that were not covered by the regular budget. Those amounted to CHF 180,000, which was less than in 2002. The second element was the project posts funded through extra budgetary funds, also known as ""L posts"". Those were not financed by the Programme Support Fund. The ""L posts"" were temporary assistance posts, which did not tend to be temporary. Financing them amounted to CHF 2,475,470. The third element related to the overheads, which was a standard way of covering administration costs and was a function of the total. Those overheads were 13% of all direct costs and amounted to CHF 4,309,950. The consolidated total was CHF 37,463,415. However, Members were expected to contribute CHF 36,500,00 as there were some funds left over from the previous year.","WTCOMTDM42.pdf","Members, Members, Members, WTO, Secretariat, WTO, Members, WTO, Secretariat, Secretariat, Geneva, WTO, Training, Institute, Members"
"4413",4413,"21","21.     He continued by saying that the planned volume of technical assistance in 2003 was more or less the same as in 2002, and the number of planned regional activities would also remain approximately the same. However, the cost estimates were significantly higher than the estimated                                                                                    WT/COMTD/M/42                                                                                            Page 9 cost of the WTO technical assistance and training activities planned for 2002. There were several reasons for that. First, the 2003 TA Plan included a significant number of activities to be held at WTO headquarters to which more capital-based officials would be invited. In 2002, such activities had been restricted for the most part to Geneva-based delegates. Inviting capital-based officials had the benefit of spreading information and enhancing capacity in the national administrations in capitals after the end of the activity. Including overheads, that accounted for approximately CHF 10 million of the increase to the cost estimates. In 2002, it had initially been proposed that the ""L posts"" be financed out of the Programme Support Fund, and some of them had been financed in that way. However, two-thirds of them had to be financed through the Global Trust Fund. 2002 was not a full year because the staff had to be recruited and had only taken up their posts in the second part of 2002. Having a full year in 2003, the costs of the same posts would be larger than in 2002. Airfares had increased significantly in 2002 following the 11 September 2001 events while the estimates for 2002 had been based on 2001 average costs before 11 September. The Secretariat often had to organise activities in upper-market hotels, in the absence of decent cheaper alternatives to ensure adequate conference facilities. Those hotels would regularly charge more for a night than the total UN per diem for the country hosting the activity. As customers the WTO could not control those elements. The anticipated average number of participants in regional activities was expected to be 20 per cent higher in 2003 compared to 2002. While it was clear that WTO Members could not influence all elements of the increased costs, any adjustment to the 2003 TA Plan which might result from the discussions in the CTD would influence the cost estimates. The cost estimates presented did not contain any provision for the repetition of the courses held in Casablanca and Nairobi, pending the evaluation of those first two pilot three-month trade policy courses. If the evaluation was positive and the courses were to be repeated, then the Secretariat would make the necessary cost estimates and provide them as an addendum. Those courses might then not only be repeated, but as requested by the Director-General, they might include a greater number of participants. Members' views with respect to those courses were welcome. He concluded by saying that, at the first pledging conference held on 11 March 2002, Members had pledged CHF 5 million for 2003. The Secretariat anticipated that the DDAGTF would show a positive balance at the end of the year. The actual size of the surplus would depend on the receipt of the remaining contributions pledged for 2002. The Secretariat hoped that pledges to the DDAGTF for 2003 would amount to CHF 36.5 million, from which should be subtracted the pledges that had been made and any balance left from 2002. Although the figure was high, technical assistance was crucial to the DDA and many Members attached high importance to it.","WTCOMTDM42.pdf","WTO, WTO, Global, Trust, Fund, Secretariat, UN, WTO, WTO, Members, CTD, Casablanca, Nairobi, Secretariat, Director-General, Members, Members, Secretariat, Secretariat, DDA, Members"
"4414",4414,"22","22.      The representative of Kenya said that, on behalf of the African Group he was pleased to hear that technical assistance was one of the four priority areas that the Director-General had identified in his administration, and that WTO comparative advantage would be applied in building the required technical assistance. The African group was also pleased that the Director-General would seek increased collaboration with other inter-governmental organisations and bilateral donors. He noted with appreciation that there was going to be a focus on commercial infrastructure, which would address the issue of supply-side constraints. The African Group looked forward to studying the new products introduced to the 2003 TA Plan in the attempt of addressing the DDA. He agreed that Members needed to focus on the quality rather than the quantity of technical assistance. That would ensure that the Members received the right products to meet their needs. The JITAP could be one of the programmes that could be emulated and extended to other African countries. His delegation needed time to study the document in order to see how it related to the needs of African countries. However, it seemed to address some of the areas that his delegation had requested and he welcomed the new products proposed. He disagreed with the Secretariat with respect to the duration of courses. Shorter courses had proved to be more expensive than the longer ones and the long courses were more comprehensive and addressed the actual needs of the beneficiary countries. He was pleased to hear that the regional courses held in Nairobi and Casablanca were undergoing evaluation. His delegation believed that those two courses had proved their usefulness, and many of the participants interviewed in Nairobi had confirmed that that was the type of technical assistance that addressed their Governments' needs. He hoped that the Secretariat would view those courses from that angle. Those WT/COMTD/M/42 Page 10 courses should have been included in the list of activities for 2003 for planning purposes. It was easier to strike off figures than to add the same figures after the budget process was completed.","WTCOMTDM42.pdf","Kenya, African, Group, Director-General, WTO, Director-General, African, Group, DDA, Members, Members, Secretariat, Nairobi, Casablanca, Nairobi, Secretariat"
"4415",4415,"23","23.      The representative of Lesotho said that his delegation shared the views that had been expressed by the Director-General. There was an urgent need for enhanced cooperation between UNCTAD and the WTO, in implementing the mandate emanating from the Doha Ministerial Conference. When considering the concentration of requests to the WTO for technical assistance, it appeared that there was a significant focus on the Singapore issues. That was where his delegation wished to see enhanced cooperation between the two institutions due to the unique experience that UNCTAD possessed in that area. He agreed with the Director-General that enhanced market access did not necessarily lead to enhanced productive and export capacity in developing and least-developed countries. There was therefore a need to focus, perhaps more than in the past, on addressing supply-side issues. He was pleased with the Director-General's referral to the need for enhanced participation of agencies such as UNIDO, which might have a comparative advantage in certain areas. He encouraged such coordination to be undertaken as soon as possible as other organisations could effectively contribute to the WTO TA programme. He said that the issue of accession was of great importance. Over the past four years the issue of accession had been on the agenda of the Sub-Committee on LDCs as well as on the agenda of the Ministerial Conferences that had been held during that time. What had been lacking were concrete steps to make the TA programmes for acceding countries effective. His delegation hoped to see a more focused and concrete approach to addressing the concerns of acceding countries, particularly LDCs. His delegation was prepared to work with the Secretariat in formulating practical approaches to that issue. He concurred with the Director-General that there was a need to improve the quality of the TA programmes undertaken by the WTO. Over the past four years his Government had been receiving technical assistance and capacity building. However, there was little difference in the content of the courses between then and at present and that pointed to a need to concentrate on the quality of the courses. The capacity in Members and observers requesting assistance was improving and there had to be a parallel process to enhance the quality of the assistance provided. The WTO had to appreciate that countries had moved forward from where they were four years ago. Rehearsing trade policy principles was not in line with the unfolding agenda that Members were faced with in the WTO. There had to be a process of continuously upgrading the content of the courses. He agreed with the Director-General that strategic partnerships were critical, and his delegation encouraged the Secretariat to work towards establishing more strategic partnerships with regional institutions and other multilateral agencies as a way of ensuring that Members programmes were fully supported and in line with processes in other institutions. He concluded by saying that his delegation was of the view that the 2003 TA Plan should not be directed towards the Cancun Ministerial Conference but should be a long-term plan that was sustainable and that delivered long lasting results. The 2003 TA Plan needed to take into account and support other dynamics that were taking place at the national and regional levels in order to be effective. His delegation needed more time to consider the 2003 TA Plan as well as the figures that had been presented by DDG Abbot to see whether those figures would be supportive of what his delegation felt was a priority in the 2003 TA Plan.","WTCOMTDM42.pdf","Lesotho, Director-General, UNCTAD, WTO, Doha, Ministerial, Conference, WTO, Singapore, UNCTAD, Director-General, Director-General, UNIDO, WTO, Secretariat, Director-General, WTO, Members, WTO, Members, WTO, Director-General, Secretariat, Members"
"4416",4416,"24","24.     The representative of Mauritius said that his delegation supported the statement made by the representative of Kenya on behalf of the African Group. He was pleased, as coordinator of the small and vulnerable economies Group in Geneva, to hear the comments that the Director-General had made with respect to small economies. The Director-General had said that, ""we need to be aware that there are several regional challenges to which we need to respond. Countries in these regions have needs as critical as those of the LDCs. These include countries in Africa, South and Central Asia, the Caribbean, and others."" He thanked the Director-General for recognising that the small and vulnerable economies had problems. He was pleased that the three requests that his Government had made on customs valuation, services and the Singapore issues had been included. His delegation would need more time to consider the 2003 TA Plan before commenting in detail on it. He highlighted that no mention had been made of small and vulnerable economies in the Secretariat's presentation of the ""lessons from 2002 implementation"", and he hoped that that would be considered.

"4417",4417,"25","25.      The representative of Haiti said that he agreed with the Director-General that technical assistance and integration into the multilateral trading system was of great importance. The 2003 TA Plan presented a list of activities to assist developing and least-developed countries to integrate further into the multilateral trading system. The Director-General had referred to issues of particular importance to his delegation, for instance quality over quantity in technical assistance delivery and the importance to be accorded to acceding countries. Haiti had been a Member of the WTO since the GATT but the Committee on Trade and Development had to attach importance to the countries in accession. It was important for the credibility of the WTO to enable the accession of LDCs. Coherence with other institutions was also important. The WTO could offer technical assistance in the form of internships, institutional capacity building, and reference centers. However, such assistance was by itself not sufficient. Supply capacities needed to be strengthened and new infrastructures were required. The WTO could not offer that service which was why coordination with other organisations such as the World Bank, IMF and regional banks was essential. He agreed with the representative of Lesotho that Members needed to do their utmost for UNIDO to participate in the discussions. He was aware that a memorandum of understanding was being elaborated between the WTO and UNIDO and he hoped that that cooperation would soon be established. The non- exhaustive list of agencies to cooperate with the WTO had to include the International Telecommunications Union (ITU). Telecommunication was important, and the ITU, which was preparing its World Summit on the Information Society, had to work hand in hand with the WTO to offer developing countries the possibility to derive benefits from the technology that was proliferating throughout the world. His delegation also wished to see the WTO establish links with the International Agency for Atomic Energy (IAEA) as it could assist in strengthening developing and least-developed country infrastructure. It could assist in strengthening those countries' capacities to use energy resources, for instance water, solar, nuclear and wind energy which were needed for those countries to develop. The Common Fund for Commodities, which had requested observer status in the CTD was another organisation of importance to Members. Members' capacities required to be strengthened to become self-sufficient in food. The Common Fund for Commodities could strengthen the WTO's position in agriculture. He said that the discussion on internships was still open and Members would see how they could use technical assistance to make progress. He was certain that many members would make contributions at the pledging conference and he thanked those members who had contributed more than expected.","WTCOMTDM42.pdf","Haiti, Director-General, Director-General, Haiti, Member, WTO, GATT, Committee, on, Trade, and, Development, WTO, WTO, WTO, World, Bank, IMF, Lesotho, Members, UNIDO, WTO, UNIDO, WTO, International, Telecommunications, Union, ITU, ITU, Information, Society, WTO, WTO, International, Agency, for, Atomic, Energy, IAEA, CTD, Members, Members, WTO, Members"
"4418",4418,"26","26.      The representative of Venezuela said that WTO's work was high priority for her Government. The presence of the Director-General at the meeting was a sign of WTO's intention to give priority to its technical assistance and training activities. Her delegation had followed the development of technical cooperation and training programmes conducted by the WTO and it had made suggestions with a view to improving those programmes and achieving efficiency. She said that her delegation was pleased that a new impulse had been given to those programmes. She commended the Secretariat for its efforts in drawing up the 2003 TA Plan. She said that the Secretariat had contacted her delegation in order to establish priorities for technical assistance and had taken on board her delegations suggestions. She noted that progress had been made with respect to collaboration with other Geneva-based organisations and hoped that it would continue. Despite those efforts there were still weaknesses in terms of implementation and efficiency in enforcing the provisions of WTO's TA programme. There was a lack of the necessary human resources as well as the fact that the Technical Cooperation Division had other internal priorities. Delegations had made efforts of communicating their priorities to the Secretariat as well as consulting with their capitals and the Technical Cooperation Division. The divisions in charge had continued to inform Members that it took long to prepare documents and that they were not in a position to carry out the activities requested by Members. That had been a bitter experience for her delegation. Her Government had spared no effort in communicating its requests. However, it had so far not received any response. Any response that would be made was bound to be negative. Efforts made towards improving the TA programme had to go hand in hand with a greater awareness in the technical divisions. The better people in her country were trained the better they would cooperate with the WTO and comply with their duties as instructed by Ministers at the Doha Ministerial Conference. The quality of TA programmes was improving. WT/COMTD/M/42 Page 12 However, her delegation was concerned with the fact that approximately 30 activities in Latin America and the Caribbean had been forfeited. On the other had, she was pleased to note that the activities conducted and planned for 2003 by the Training Institute emphasized the training of trainers programmes. She hoped that it would be possible to connect that programme with university networks. She encouraged the Secretariat to continue efforts in that direction and to improve coordination with academic institutions. Her delegation hoped that sufficient means would be given to the Training Institute in order to coordinate with other institutions as part of a high level academic network. The new programme implied new challenges and her Government had applied for 18 activities. Her delegation felt that the number of participants in each course should be increased and that pilot courses be conducted in the Latin American region. She echoed the point made by the Director-General at the High Level Segment of the UNCTAD Trade and Development Board Meeting, that technical assistance was key to improve the understanding of processes, in particular to the understanding of the consequences of negotiations for developing country Members.","WTCOMTDM42.pdf","Venezuela, WTO, Director-General, WTO, WTO, Secretariat, Secretariat, WTO, Technical, Cooperation, Division, Secretariat, Technical, Cooperation, Division, Members, Members, WTO, Doha, Ministerial, Conference, Latin, America, Caribbean, Training, Institute, Secretariat, Training, Institute, Director-General, UNCTAD, Trade, and, Development, Board, Meeting, Members"
"4419",4419,"27","27.      The representative of South Africa said that the 2003 Technical Assistance Plan showed that WTO TA was moving in the right direction. He expressed his appreciation for the Director-General's interest in the issue of technical assistance because it was one of the pillars of the current negotiations. He said that he would begin by making some broad contextual points before commenting in detail on the 2003 TA Plan and on some of the remarks that the Director-General had made. With respect to the broader context, he said that it was important for Members to recognise that both market access and TRTA and capacity building were among the key issues that Ministers had put on the agenda of many global conferences and committed themselves to supporting as they were critical to the development process. Those conferences included the International Conference on Financing for Development, the World Food Summit and the World Summit for Sustainable Development (WSSD). The WSSD had reaffirmed the commitment of all the leaders who were present, to the DDA with the emphasis on development. The leaders had also committed themselves to increased technical assistance and capacity building, particularly during the negotiations. While discussing the issue of capacity building, Members needed to be aware that genuine, meaningful and substantial technical assistance and capacity building was most effectively provided by genuine market access for developing countries. Genuine market access required significant and substantive changes in the trade policies of developed countries. Although those issues were being discussed in other fora of the WTO, he reminded delegations that the key issues involved were domestic support and export subsidies, some of the rules that increase protection such as trade remedies, and a number of the regulatory issues including Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures (SPS) and Technical Barriers to Trade (TBTs) which could have and had had the effect of increasing protection and increasing the barriers to developed country markets. Recent studies had highlighted the fact that those policies of developed countries had had and continued to have a negative developmental effect on developing countries and estimates of losses ranged anywhere between US$50 billion to US$100 billion per annum. That had to be kept in mind when the 2003 TA Plan was discussed.","WTCOMTDM42.pdf","South, Africa, WTO, Director-General, Director-General, Members, TRTA, WSSD, DDA, Members, WTO, SPS"
"4420",4420,"28","28.     He continued by saying that the DDA contained a commitment to include technical assistance and capacity building as a term of the agreement to launch the new round of negotiations. Therefore, it was a significant negotiating issue that Ministers would pay a lot of attention to at the next Ministerial Conference. He said that special and differential treatment (S&D) was a key issue as developing countries had not benefited as much as they should have from the processes of globalization and because the benefits had accrued mainly to developed countries. The need for adjustment by developing countries as they continued with the process of integration was something that would cause increased burdens on already marginalized and vulnerable economies. The process by which those economies liberalised and integrated into the world economy had to be managed cautiously. It had to be carried out in a customized and properly sequenced manner. S&D was therefore important, and the way in which capacity building was managed for beneficiaries of S&D required careful discussion. He agreed with the Director-General's broad categorisation of technical assistance and capacity building. The three categories that the Director-General had suggested that Members focus on were the need to assist countries to negotiate effectively, the need to build capacity                                                                                    WT/COMTD/M/42                                                                                           Page 13 for countries to implement rules, and the need to build commercial infrastructure including supply- side support. With respect to the need to negotiate effectively, he said that while the WTO had an important role to play, it was not competent to provide the support that developing countries required. Members required assistance in three broad areas in order to negotiate effectively. First, developing countries needed to develop appropriate trade policies and strategies so that their negotiating strategy was part of a broader set of development and economic policies. Second, Members needed to develop appropriate trade and market access strategies and think about how their bilateral and regional strategies were synchronized with their multilateral strategies. He did not think that the WTO could provide the necessary assistance in that particular area. Third, a more sustainable way of developing the capacity of Members to negotiate was to build appropriate institutions to develop intra-Government cohesion and for consultations and consensus building with other stakeholders - including the private sector and NGOs. That area required more attention and competence than was available within the current mandate and portfolio of resources in the WTO. He would make some proposals regarding how to deal with those issues. He went on to say that there was a need for the WTO to take into account the need to work with other institutions on negotiating skills, on issues relating to implementation and compliance, and to commercial infrastructure and supply-side support. There had to be coherence with other multilateral institutions such as UNCTAD, ITC, and the World Bank, not only in the form of general coordination but also in terms of policy content and substance. One of the questions raised in discussions during the previous months was how Members without capacity would identify their own interests and make demands on the Secretariat. What was required was needs assessments. A deeper process was required in order to establish what developing countries needs were. He said that while the WTO Secretariat was doing a good job with its limited resources, it needed to draw on experiences gained over the years in capacity building, trade negotiations and trade policy development. He referred to the experiences of the more developed developing countries, which were not utilised in the development and implementation of WTO technical assistance programmes. He said that there was a need for some kind of advisory structure to the current WTO Secretariat on technical assistance and capacity building. Another question he wished to raise was how the WTO meaningfully could contribute to the process of implementation of WTO agreements in developing countries, particularly in those that required S&D. He asked how it could be ensured that the development objectives and strategies of those countries were in alignment with the implementation requirements of the WTO agreements and with the implementation difficulties that those countries faced. Proposals to create a monitoring mechanism had been made in that regard. A monitoring mechanism would develop appropriate capacity building programmes which would be in alignment with the implementation problems and development strategies of developing countries.","WTCOMTDM42.pdf","DDA, Director-General, Director-General, Members, WTO, Members, Members, WTO, Members, WTO, WTO, UNCTAD, ITC, World, Bank, Members, Secretariat, WTO, Secretariat, WTO, WTO, Secretariat, WTO, WTO, WTO"
"4421",4421,"29","29.      He further said that he had made those points because he had been asked to chair an informal group of Members which had met over the past few months and were concerned about those issues. He had chaired three out of four meetings held. The origins of that informal group went back to the discussion that had taken place with the Canadian delegation. The group consisted of all the major developed country donors and a number of beneficiary developing countries. The WTO Secretariat had participated in a number of the discussions. The group had been seized with the need to improve the efficiency and quality of the technical assistance and capacity building programmes that had been implemented and were being implemented. The group had been concerned with the need to ensure that the 2003 TA Plan took into account the lessons and experiences of the previous years. The group had identified four issues for further discussion and with regard to which it hoped to make contributions. The first issue was how the quality of the current technical assistance programmes could be improved and how it could be ensured that the 2003 TA Plan did not suffer from the same difficulties and criticisms that the 2002 TA Plan had. The second issue was how to ensure that a simple and quick needs analysis was carried out. It did not have to be as complex as the IF diagnostic analysis but would still establish which were the needs at the country level. The third issue was how to ensure that there was real coherence notably between the multilateral agencies but also between the bilateral donors and the multilateral institutions. There had been a number of difficulties in the field where bilateral donors had tended to influence the programmes in the direction of their own polices WT/COMTD/M/42 Page 14 and strategies. That was a common concern and there was a desire to reduce that tendency and to make the WTO programme a true multilateral one, but one that still included the contribution of multilateral agencies. The fourth issue related to the need for overall guidance for the WTO TA. He said that the group was keen to discuss with the Director-General how to go forward on that issue. He concluded by saying that the next meeting of developing countries participating in the informal group was going to be coordinated by the delegation of Colombia. Both the delegations of South Africa and Canada were available to discuss any of the issues in more details with any other delegations who were interested in participating in the group.","WTCOMTDM42.pdf","Members, WTO, Secretariat, WTO, WTO, Director-General, Colombia, South, Africa, Canada"

"4423",4423,"30","30.      The representative of Zambia said that he would not make any substantive comments on the 2003 TA Plan. He would also defer any detailed comments in his capacity as coordinator of the LDC Group for a later date. He thanked the Director-General for his policy statement which had given Members the feeling that Members and the Secretariat were moving toward some sort of policy convergence in the area of technical assistance and capacity building. He believed that stating policy objectives in advance of doing something always clarified matters. His delegation had always stated that there were parts of TRTA and capacity building that the WTO Secretariat was most suited to deliver and other parts that it was not. It was good that that had been reflected in the documents. Most of the LDCs preferred a certain type of technical assistance. That was the long-term technical assistance and capacity building such as supply-side assistance, trade infrastructure creation and institution building. He recalled that there had been demand for increased cooperation between the WTO and institutions such as UNCTAD. There had also been a request for UNCTAD to be included in the sharing of resources so that it could deliver the assistance that developing countries needed and that the WTO could not supply. He sought clarification with respect to the statement in bullet point 6 on page 5, in document WT/COMTD/W/104 which read ""sixth, recipient countries have shifted priorities in their TA/CB requests "". He said that that was inaccurate as Members priorities had remained consistent. What Members had done was to reclarify their priorities with the realisation of what the WTO could offer. Another statement in bullet point 6 on page 5, read ""As an agency, the WTO cannot deliver, in this regard, except through co-ordinated arrangements with development agencies and bilateral donors, and the recipient countries themselves"". He compared that with the statement in paragraph 6 on page 6, of WT/COMTD/W/104, that read ""The challenge of the 2003 WTO Annual Plan for TA/CB is to build capacity in the beneficiary countries for effective negotiations, legal implementation of WTO Agreements, and trade integration."" He said that the first mentioned quotation stated that the WTO could not deliver ""trade integration"" and yet it was included in paragraph 6. He therefore sought clarification with respect to how the WTO Secretariat would deal with trade integration.","WTCOMTDM42.pdf","Zambia, LDC, Group, Director-General, Members, Members, Secretariat, WTO, Secretariat, WTO, UNCTAD, UNCTAD, WTO, Members, Members, WTO, WTO, WTO, WTO, WTO, WTO, Secretariat"
"4424",4424,"31","31.      The representative of Bangladesh said that the 2003 TA Plan mainly focused on seminars and workshops. His delegation had repeatedly mentioned that those types of activities were neither helpful to his Government, nor LDCs in general. Only Members with expertise in WTO agreements could benefit from seminars and workshops by developing their expertise and updating their knowledge. His Government had identified its capacity building needs and realised that there was a need to develop institutional capacity. His Government could not participate effectively in WTO negotiations unless it could develop domestic institutions. It had therefore submitted technical assistance requests to the WTO with the objective of developing endogenous capacity to analyse WTO related issues. With that in mind his Government had proposed the selection of one private university and one government-owned training institute to develop capacity to run training programmes on WTO trade-related issues of interest to his Government. Those training programmes would be directed to government officials, private sector and civil society representatives. They would include the findings of recent research and analysis of WTO-related issues, particularly in areas with a bearing on ongoing negotiations and where negotiations might be required. When requested by either the government or the private sector the institutions would provide policy advice on WTO-related matters to assist the Government and the private sector representatives to implement the WTO agreements. Such assistance would include advice in the submission of periodic notifications and reports and in observing standards. As part of the 2003 TA programme, his delegation had                                                                                     WT/COMTD/M/42                                                                                            Page 15 requested assistance from the WTO to build capacity of such institutions. That included the provision of facilities such as library and a database on WTO related material, the equipment required for teaching and running courses, teaching aids and training modules on subjects of specific interests to LDCs, training of faculty and other resource personnel to fulfil the objective mentioned in paragraph 34 a-d in document WT/COMTD/W/104, i.e. training of trainers and to associate the institutions with seminars and workshops run by the WTO in Geneva, Bangladesh or its region. His delegation had requested the increased participation of candidates from Bangladesh in the Geneva-based training programmes as well as the organisation of regional seminars and workshops in Bangladesh with the participation of LDCs, in the areas of market access for agricultural and non agricultural products, services negotiations and in the area of trade and environment. His delegation had also requested the organisation of national workshops on TRIPS, WTO rules, and agriculture in association with his Government. He said that most of the needs expressed by his Government had unfortunately not been taken into account in the 2003 TA Plan. Although in the 2003 TA Plan there were three national courses for Bangladesh, as for the other LDCs, the key need of institutional building had not been included in the 2003 TA Plan. He hoped that due consideration would be given to the capacity building needs of his Government in the revised 2003 TA Plan.","WTCOMTDM42.pdf","Bangladesh, LDCs, Members, WTO, WTO, WTO, WTO, WTO, WTO, WTO, WTO, WTO, Geneva, Bangladesh, Bangladesh, Bangladesh, WTO, Bangladesh"
"4425",4425,"32","32.      The representative of Jamaica said that his delegation welcomed the 2003 TA Plan which listed the range of activities to be conducted at the national and regional levels. The 2003 TA Plan was presented in two separate documents. Document WT/COMTD/W/104 gave an overview of the challenges faced and the Secretariat's thinking in developing the 2003 TA Plan, and document WT/COMTD/W/104/Add.1 contained the activities to be implemented. He noted from section 5 of WT/COMTD/W/104 that 118 countries had submitted a total of 1038 requests with the Singapore issues, capacity building and services being the top three priority areas. The document also stated that there had been a shift in Members' technical assistance requests to greater emphasis being placed on capacity building for trade integration and the need to address supply-side constraints. However, the focus remained on capacity building in the area of the WTO negotiations and understanding and implementing the WTO agreements. His delegation supported the increased emphasis on building what had been described as commercial infrastructure. He noted from document WT/COMTD/W/104 that while the Secretariat acknowledged that that was outside the ambit of the WTO, it would be making greater efforts to enhance coordination between the WTO and other international organisations such as the World Bank, UNIDO and UNDP with a view to meeting Members requirements in that area. His delegation had always held the view that technical assistance should not only be restricted to increase Members' awareness about the rules, but should also consider supply-side constraints which hindered production and Members' ability to compete in the global market-place. While it was obvious that the WTO would increase its efforts in that regard, it was still not clear how, operationally, the greater inter-agency co-ordination and implementation envisaged in the 2003 TA Plan would be achieved. In that context, his delegation hoped that the scope of the standards trade development facility, which Members had been informed about, would be broad enough to encompass not only the traditional technical assistance relating to the WTO agreements but to go beyond that.","WTCOMTDM42.pdf","Jamaica, Secretariat, Singapore, Members, WTO, WTO, Secretariat, WTO, WTO, World, Bank, UNIDO, UNDP, Members, Members, Members, WTO, Members, WTO"
"4426",4426,"33","33.     On the issue of the nature of the requests submitted by Members he went on to say that it was not surprising to note that, in addition to the requests for the more conventional modes of technical assistance, there was at present a shift towards more resource intensive activities such as internships and national short trade policy courses in an effort to build capacity. As the work programme and the negotiations launched at the Doha Ministerial Conference intensified, Members requests for technical assistance in newer areas would increase as there was greater value added to be gained from such programmes. His delegation was able to speak of the benefits of such programmes as it had been a beneficiary of the WTO mission internship programme which had been introduced on a pilot basis by the WTO in 2001. He noted that in response, the Secretariat had undertaken to develop various modes of technical assistance such as seminars, workshops, training activities, training of trainers, and distance learning programmes. He also noted the development of the two new modes of technical assistance, namely the trade clinics and the use of the WTO references centres as a point for WT/COMTD/M/42 Page 16 establishing training of trainer programmes. Those new modes were interesting and his delegation wished to receive further information on them.                   He said that section IX of document WT/COMTD/W/104 acknowledged that there were certain regions, including the Caribbean, that were in urgent need of enhanced technical assistance and capacity building to adjust to a more open trading environment and to compete and participate more effectively in the multilateral trading system. His delegation appreciated that the Caribbean region had been accorded priority by the WTO and that it would obtain greater levels of assistance from the WTO in cooperation with other regional and international organisations. He hoped that funding for the regional three month trade policy courses would be forthcoming and sustained so that that particular programme could continue and be extended to other regions. He admitted that it was difficult to narrow his Government's requests for technical assistance in 2003 to the required limit, given his country's numerous technical assistance requirements. However, his delegation looked forward to working with the WTO and the relevant regional bodies in staging the activities that had been approved.","WTCOMTDM42.pdf","Members, Doha, Ministerial, Conference, Members, WTO, WTO, Secretariat, WTO, Caribbean, Caribbean, WTO, WTO, WTO"
"4427",4427,"34","34.      The representative of the European Communities said that his delegation was pleased to receive the 2003 TA Plan three months before the end of the year. That gave Members time to consider and comment on it. His delegation would discuss it with all member states of the European Communities. They were the major donors of the Trust Fund. Technical assistance was a crucial part of the DDA and it was encouraging that developing country Members had identified needs related to the negotiating agenda, including the Singapore issues, trade policy development, trade and services, rules, agriculture, market access and TRIPS implementation as a matter of priority. His delegation agreed with the three stage approach presented by the Director-General. Those three stages included technical assistance for negotiations, technical assistance for institutional capacity building and implementation, and technical assistance for trade integration and commercial infrastructure. That approach related closely to the European Commissions' objective identified in its recent communication to the Council of Ministers and the European Parliament. The European Commission had, in that communication spelt out how it intended to go about following up on the DDA, the Monterrey Conference on Financing for Development and the WSSD in Johannesburg. It laid down a doctrine for trade and development for the next five years which coincided with the three stage approach. It was important to acknowledge that the WTO could not do everything on its own as it was neither a full time training institute nor a development agency. The work on technical assistance and capacity building was important and related to the DDA but should not be to the detriment of the core work, which was negotiating new rules within a short time period. His delegation felt that some improvements could be made with respect to the implementation of the 2003 TA Plan. He would provide some observations and would further liase with the Secretariat. His delegation welcomed the needs based approach on which the 2003 TA Plan was based. However, he asked for more detailed information regarding the identification of those needs by developing countries and by the Secretariat. His delegation had the impression that the theoretical basis for imbedding technical assistance in the national development policies and in the PRSPs was not necessarily backed by reality and his delegation wished to hear more about the practical implementation of the process. His delegation welcomed the cooperation with the Bretton Woods institutions and the regional development banks and he asked for a detailed explanation as to what the practical arrangements for that cooperation were. He knew that the Director-General was keen to have close cooperation with other agencies. He requested that the Secretariat indicate how far it was responding to the technical assistance needs identified in the diagnostic trade integration studies undertaken by the IF. With respect to regional coverage, he stressed the importance of focusing on LDCs and low-income countries. He said that an issue that needed to be discussed in more detail was the evaluation of the implementation of the 2002 TA Plan. He understood that implementation was behind schedule and that by the end of 2002, a good part of the 2002 TA Plan would not have been implemented. He asked whether the non- implemented activities would be taken up in the following year in parallel with the 2003 TA Plan or whether they would be dropped. It was important to analyse in depth the financial side of the implementation of the 2002 TA Plan, for instance in terms of what had been spent, how procurement had been done and how much was left. That was crucial information to both the Members and the                                                                                     WT/COMTD/M/42                                                                                            Page 17 donors. It was important for donors to be able to make an assessment of the financial implications of the 2002 TA Plan before committing themselves to new pledges. It was a question of accountability towards their constituencies and taxpayers.","WTCOMTDM42.pdf","European, Communities, Members, Trust, Fund, DDA, Members, Singapore, Director-General, Council, of, Ministers, European, Parliament, European, Commission, DDA, Monterrey, WSSD, Johannesburg, WTO, DDA, Secretariat, Secretariat, Director-General, Secretariat, Members"
"4428",4428,"35","35.      He went on to say that he had been surprised by the costing of the 2003 TA Plan. The figures were three times higher than those for the 2002 TA Plan and a lot of the 2002 activities had not yet been implemented. He said that it was ambitious to triple the total amount without having been able to implement the planned activities for 2002. Members would have to consider both the financial side of the implementation of the 2002 activities and the implications of the estimated costs for 2003. When pledging for the 2003 TA Plan Members needed to be certain that the capacity was available to implement a meaningful and operational plan, which would help Members in their endeavours to achieve the objectives of the DDA. Until that was clear a pledging exercise would be difficult and donor fatigue could be expected. He concluded by raising the issue of the Secretariat's capacity to deliver 450 individual activities. When considering the three stage approach presented by the Director-General he acknowledged that the Secretariat had said that the third stage was not core WTO business. The development of infrastructure was more a question for other development cooperation partners. He also acknowledged that in the second stage there would be an attempt to outsource a lot of the activities to specialised development agencies. He said that he was still concerned that the WTO Secretariat alone would deliver the first stage. If it had to deliver 450 activities it was likely that Secretariat staff would spend more time flying around the globe than assisting the negotiating groups with the priority work before the Cancun Ministerial Conference and between the Cancun Ministerial Conference and the end of the negotiating round. He therefore urged the Secretariat to consider whether it would be possible to outsource some of those activities, either to regional public management institutions, university institutes or consultants, or by the way of tendering which would ensure the best value for money. Attempting to do everything on its own would over-stretch the limited human resources that the Secretariat possessed. Carrying out regional activities was also better as it was closer to the source where the capacity should be increased. It should therefore be done by local public or private organisations as far as possible. He said that the European Union had had a good experience in outsourcing those kinds of activities. His delegation looked forward to an in-depth discussion which should result in an effective 2003 TA Plan: a 2003 TA Plan which could be served by the limited resources, which was well-founded, which could be implemented during 2003, which was well linked to the priorities of the DDA and which remained within the reasonable limits of what could be pledged by the donor community in the WTO.","WTCOMTDM42.pdf","Members, Members, Members, DDA, Secretariat, Director-General, Secretariat, WTO, WTO, Secretariat, Secretariat, Cancun, Ministerial, Conference, Secretariat, Secretariat, European, Union, DDA, WTO"
"4429",4429,"36","36.      The representative of Thailand said that her delegation was pleased that the Director-General had identified TA as one of his four priority areas. She also supported the focus on the quality of technical assistance. Importance therefore had to be attached to the evaluation system. She agreed with the Director-General that technical assistance should not only focus on the Fifth Ministerial Conference to be held in Cancun but that it should go beyond the Doha Ministerial Conference negotiations. In that regard she echoed the statement made by the representative of South Africa regarding the problems faced by developing countries with respect to non-tariff measures. Her delegation felt that that was a priority issue and it was Members' task to streamline that issue in their technical assistance and capacity building requests so that benefits could accrue to them through the technical assistance programmes. She thanked the Secretariat for the two national seminars on regional trade agreements and on investment granted to her country in 2002. Her delegation did not only attach importance to those negotiation issues but also to human resource development. She said that her delegation found the regional trade policy courses in Nairobi and Casablanca interesting. It would be useful to expand that kind of activity to other regions by making use of the existing facilities in each region. She gave the example of the ESCAP facility and the UNCTAD Trade Related Training Institute. Her delegation looked forward to working closely with the Secretariat on that issue.","WTCOMTDM42.pdf","Thailand, Director-General, Director-General, Cancun, South, Africa, Members, Secretariat, Nairobi, ESCAP, UNCTAD, Trade, Related, Training, Institute, Secretariat"
"4430",4430,"37","37.     The representative of Uruguay said that her delegation acknowledged the Secretariat's effort and attention paid to the priorities suggested by Member delegations. Her Government had requested WT/COMTD/M/42 Page 18 three national activities to be conducted in the areas of trade and the environment, dispute settlement and trade and investment. She noted that only one of those requests, that on trade and environment, had been included in the 2003 TA Plan. The requests her Government had made were of high priority as they were important components of the technical assistance that her country required. She hoped that due attention would be paid to those requests.","WTCOMTDM42.pdf","Uruguay, Secretariat, Member"
"4431",4431,"38","38.      The representative of Canada said that her delegation realised that when preparing the 2003 TA Plan it was difficult to accommodate the unlimited demands with the constrained ability to deliver. Her delegation appreciated that the 2003 TA Plan was available three months before the end of the year as that enabled delegations to work collectively, comment and have it approved, costed and funded for delivery in January 2003. She cited the informal network chaired by the delegation of South Africa, that had been created to discuss TA and said that it was open to all delegations that wished to participate in it. With respect to the 2003 TA Plan, she said that the Secretariat was attempting to do too much itself. More effort needed to be made to collaborate with bilateral donors, multilateral agencies and the larger developing countries that had indicated their willingness and ability to mentor. Her delegation wished to see a detailed, costed report of what had been accomplished during 2002 with the funds provided for the 2002 TA Plan. That report should also contain information regarding what had not been done due to the ad hoc activities undertaken. That would enable Members to consider what could be delivered in 2003. The 2003 TA Plan was an ambitious plan and considering what had been delivered of the 2002 TA Plan it seemed impossible that all of the activities in the 2003 TA Plan would be delivered. She said that her delegation was surprised by the costing because figures that had been presented at the Committee on BFA meeting were different. Her delegation had concluded from those figures that it would be difficult to spend CHF 25 million during the remainder of the year if only 11 million had been spent in the first nine months of 2002 on the 2002 TA Plan. CHF 5 million had already been committed for the 2003 TA Plan. Her delegation looked forward to the joint discussions of the Committee on BFA and the CTD on the costing of the 2003 TA Plan. Her delegation wished to see a closer relationship between the categories used in the 2003 TA Plan and the database that was being created for tracking all TRTA. That would enable Members to better analyse their collective progress as well as the progress of the WTO TA delivery.","WTCOMTDM42.pdf","Canada, South, Africa, Secretariat, Members, Committee, BFA, Committee, BFA, CTD, Members, WTO"
"4432",4432,"39","39.     The representative of Mexico said that technical assistance was a fundamental element to promote the development of developing countries and help them integrate into the multilateral trading system. He said that technical assistance should be directed towards assisting Members to utilise the rights conferred upon them in the multilateral agreements and in that respect assist them to comply with their obligations. A few Members like his own were both donors and recipients of technical assistance and had been able to gain experience on the effects of technical assistance. He said that the Director-General's fourth and fifth point in his introductory comments were fundamental. It was important to build technical capacity in Members. The quality of the various technical assistance programmes was also important. He agreed that quality should be given priority over quantity. A point that had been recently raised was the need to analyse the durability of the effects of technical assistance. What often occurred was that technical assistance to strengthening human capacities had diminishing returns with time. When human resources received training from various organisations, their knowledge became attractive for the private sector and in many instances the Government could not compete with salaries from the private sector. All the technical assistance granted towards human resources and human capacity building did not remain in the institutions. Members needed to focus on that if they wished to avail themselves of the various rights in the agreements. His delegation would be presenting a proposal on technical assistance with respect to TBT. That was an example of how Members could focus more on assistance to institutions rather than assistance to individuals. It was not that human capacity was not important, but institutions represented an essential element for the implementation of WTO agreements. His Government's TBT proposal would seek to ensure that technical assistance was directed to offices on rules, providing documentation and offering quality management services. Regardless of the operations involved, there would be a guide indicating the rights and obligations that existed in the framework of the TBT Agreement. By that example, his                                                                                    WT/COMTD/M/42                                                                                           Page 19 delegation felt that it was providing something that could be useful in other fora because institutions would be strengthened more than human capacities.","WTCOMTDM42.pdf","Mexico, Members, Members, Director-General, Members, Members, TBT, Members, WTO, TBT"
"4433",4433,"4","4.      The Chairman recalled that, in previous sessions of the CTD, Members had agreed to invite a number of intergovernmental organizations on an ad hoc meeting-by-meeting basis. Those were the Arab Maghreb Union (AMU); the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS); the Economic Cooperation Organisation (ECO); the Inter-Arab Investment Guarantee Corporation; the Islamic Development Bank (IDB); the Organisation of African Unity (OAU); the Organisation of the Islamic Conference (OIC); the South Centre; the South Pacific Forum; the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP); the West African Economic and Monetary Union (WAEMU); and the World Intellectual Property Organisation (WIPO). He proposed that, in accordance with the CTD procedures, those Organizations be invited to the next formal meeting of the Committee.","WTCOMTDM42.pdf","Chairman, CTD, Members, Economic, Community, of, West, African, States, ECOWAS, Economic, Cooperation, Organisation, Inter-Arab, Investment, Guarantee, Corporation, Islamic, Development, Bank, IDB, Organisation, of, African, Unity, OAU, Organisation, Islamic, Conference, OIC, South, Centre, South, Pacific, United, Nations, Environment, Programme, UNEP, West, African, Economic, and, Monetary, Union, WAEMU, World, Intellectual, Property, Organisation, WIPO, CTD, Committee"
"4434",4434,"40","40.     He continued by saying that the representative of Bangladesh had mentioned that many Members focused on holding seminars and workshops without having the capacity to implement provisions. It would be an advantage to optimise technical assistance resources by having a common objective and not delivering 50 courses on the same subject. He said that resources should be geared towards a concrete objective. His delegation's proposal could facilitate for Members to benefit from each other's experiences and optimise resources in Members which might not have the same level of experience in that area. He said that his delegation would soon present that document to the Secretariat. Strengthening the capacities of institutions rather than humans was something that should be taken into account. That would make the allocation of technical assistance resources more effective.","WTCOMTDM42.pdf","Bangladesh, Members, Members, Members, Secretariat"
"4435",4435,"41","41.     The representative of Morocco said that his delegation supported the statement made by the representative of Kenya on behalf of the African Group. The 2003 TA Plan would be of crucial importance for developing and least-developed countries in the present negotiating context of the WTO. The creation of a real development round as decided at the Doha Ministerial Conference would depend on the technical assistance and capacity building provided in the period before the Cancun Ministerial Conference keeping in mind that important decisions would have to be taken, for example with respect to the Singapore issues. The issue remained complex for developing countries. Only a real strengthening of negotiating techniques would assist developing and least-developed countries to fully integrate into the multilateral trading system. His delegation endorsed the approach presented by the Director-General making negotiating techniques and capacity building a priority. He recalled his delegation's thoughts presented at the high level meeting on technical assistance held in July 2002. The first related to specialisation. In a negotiating context, such as that post-Doha, it was indispensable to focus on the deepening of the WTO agreements rather than for Members to restrict themselves to consider the articles at face value. Such an approach required the identification of well-targeted themes for a specialized audience. Second, such activities should be included in a regional context. That would respond to the dual objective of rationalizing the cost of the training by including more participants and permitting greater interaction between participants with different backgrounds. Third, he agreed with the representative of Kenya that the technical assistance activities should be held over longer periods. Experience had shown that beneficiaries initially required more time to understand certain complex issues. Fourth, the theoretical courses should be complemented by practical experience. Training could be given in the form of internships in the administrations of Members with more developed structures for dealing with WTO issues. That kind of partnership between administrations should enable the recipients to deepen their practical knowledge by working with concrete cases experienced by the host administration. With respect to the 2003 TA Plan, he noted with satisfaction that three activities were foreseen for Morocco relating to investment, SPS and a technical mission to assist in the preparations for the trade policy review for Morocco scheduled for June 2003. His Government had indicated other priority areas such as transparency in government procurement and the upholding of other commercial matters. He said his delegation would revert to the trade policy course held in Casablanca at a later stage. A national evaluation of that course was being undertaken, keeping in mind that it was a pilot project.","WTCOMTDM42.pdf","Morocco, Kenya, African, Group, WTO, Doha, Ministerial, Conference, Cancun, Ministerial, Conference, Singapore, Director-General, WTO, Members, Kenya, Members, WTO, Morocco, SPS, Morocco, Casablanca"
"4436",4436,"42","42.     The representative of Cuba said that her delegation would study the documents in order to comment on the substance at the following meeting. She said that technical assistance provided by the WTO had to have two fundamental objectives to become an effective tool for the integration of developing countries into the multilateral trading system. Those were facilitating the effective participation of developing countries in negotiations and helping to facilitate increased market access. With respect to the participation of developing countries in negotiations, important contributions were made by the seminars, workshops and various courses included in the 2003 TA Plan. However, human infrastructure was not sufficient for the exporters of developing and least-developed countries to become competitive in the international market and have access to their principle market. Material WT/COMTD/M/42 Page 20 infrastructure was necessary to support national efforts to implement the rules conditioning the packaging, labeling and other technical regulations required by industrialized countries or to comply with SPS and environmental measures governing imports in the main markets and to get access to new technological developments that were already part of the new conditions in international trade. Document WT/COMTD/W/100 contained an interesting characteristic of the growth of world exports, namely its correlation with the level of technology. That was missing from the 2003 TA Plan. If Members did not wish developing countries to be condemned to be exporters of commodities whose prices declined by the day it was necessary for WTO's technical assistance to be closely coordinated with that of other institutions. She agreed with the representative of the European Commission that the WTO could not do everything alone. There were other international organisations which had comparative advantages in that respect, for instance the International Chamber of Commerce (ICC), the United Nations Conference of Trade and Development (UNCTAD), the Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO), the International Telecommunications Union (ITU), and the Common Fund for Commodities. In that connection she drew Members' attention to an ICC project connected to poverty alleviation through exports. That was an example of what other institutions were doing and what could be achieved by working in a coordinated fashion. The technical assistance that her Government country had received from the WTO had contributed to improving the awareness of the public and private sectors in her country but it was not sufficient. It was for that reason that her Government had presented its priorities for 2003. Taking into account that the document on the 2003 TA Plan had been recently distributed, she suggested that the item be kept on the agenda for the following meeting of the Committee so that delegations could analyse priorities bilaterally with the Secretariat. Technical assistance and capacity building was a matter that had been given priority by Ministers at the Doha Ministerial Conference and by the Director-General in his statements. Technical assistance together with market access were necessary for Members like Cuba that had an open economy with high export dependency.","WTCOMTDM42.pdf","Cuba, WTO, SPS, Members, WTO, European, Commission, WTO, International, Chamber, of, Commerce, ICC, United, Nations, Conference, of, Trade, and, Development, UNCTAD, Food, and, Agricultural, Organization, FAO, International, Telecommunications, Union, ITU, Members, ICC, WTO, Committee, Secretariat, Doha, Ministerial, Conference, Director-General, Members, Cuba"
"4437",4437,"43","43.      The representative of Sri Lanka said that her delegation was pleased to note that the Director-General had identified technical assistance and capacity building as one of the four pillars that he intended to pursue during his term at the WTO. He had provided a broader definition of technical assistance by including programmes pertaining to building trade integration and commercial infrastructure in developing countries. Her delegation shared the comments made by most delegations, particularly those made by the representatives of Kenya and Mauritius on the proposed 2003 TA Plan. She welcomed the Director-General's new initiative that the WTO Secretariat through its 2003 TA Plan intended to respond to the needs of regions such as Africa, South and Central Asia and the Caribbean. Her delegation was pleased to note that priority would also be given to countries in the South Asian Association of Regional Cooperation (SAARC) region. The region consisted of three developing countries and four LDCs, two of which had not yet acceded to the WTO. It was therefore a region with special challenges that required enhanced technical assistance. She said that her delegation was sympathetic towards the Secretariat's situation with respect to delivering the technical assistance and capacity building programmes. As had been stated, the 2003 TA Plan had been designed on the basis of refined requests received from developing countries. The requests varied because of the different levels of development among requesting Members. In that sense, a programme identified by one member might be inadequate from another Member's point of view. She said that her delegation did not agree with what had been said by the representative of Mexico as some developing countries needed human resource development just as much as institutional building. It was not possible for one single programme to suit every developing country. In that regard, her delegation was grateful that the document containing the 2003 TA Plan captured the varying degrees of technical assistance and capacity building needs of developing countries. She believed that Members would be able to approve the proposed 2003 TA Plan which represented the minimal list of technical assistance requirements of developing countries. She had heard other delegations' concerns with respect to having to prioritise their requests and not having all of them included in the 2003 TA Plan. Her delegation shared the views stated by the representative of Uruguay and her Government had also had to prioritise its requests to meet a minimal list of needs. She hoped that the funds necessary to implement the 2003 TA Plan would be secured.

"4438",4438,"44","44.      The representative of Senegal said that it was unnecessary to recall how important technical assistance was for developing countries in general and LDCs in particular. He commended the Director-General for his outlook on technical assistance and on the priority areas he had set. He said that he was pleased to see that the Secretariat had begun work on the 2003 TA Plan earlier than in the previous year as it had taken some time for the CTD to consider the 2002 TA Plan. Although the many national technical assistance requests could not be met, some of them could be met at the regional level. His delegation believed that Member's requests should be approved on an indicative basis as it would be good if some ad hoc requests could be met as well as long as they remained within the overall budget. He said that it was appropriate, as the Director-General had pointed out, that technical assistance be considered for a period extending beyond the Fifth Ministerial Meeting. That was important for the LDCs within the IF. It was a matter of having clear objectives for WTO TA. The third type of technical assistance mentioned, i.e. for commercial infrastructure, was important for the LDCs as, second to market access, it was a question of having effective access. That could only be achieved if supply capacity was improved. However, it was not for the WTO to carry out all assistance alone. Some of it was within the mandate of other international organisations. Nevertheless, the WTO provided the framework for a broad overview of all trade-related questions. The Secretariat could still assist Members on demanding TA not related to its specific area of competence. He mentioned that the technical assistance programme in the TBT and SPS area had to be provided in cooperation with standard setting organisations for developing countries to really benefit. He concluded by saying that his delegation supported the statement made by the representative of Kenya.","WTCOMTDM42.pdf","Senegal, LDCs, Director-General, Secretariat, CTD, Member, Director-General, LDCs, WTO, LDCs, WTO, WTO, Secretariat, Members, TBT, SPS, Kenya"

The representative of Mauritania said that his delegation associated itself with the statements made by the representative of Kenya on behalf of the African Group and the representative of Zambia on behalf of the LDCs. He said that he was pleased to hear the Director-General confirm that technical assistance would be one of the four pillars of his mandate. The priorities he had set out were clear and consistent with what had already been achieved in the spirit of the DDA. The Director-General had said that the key to successful capacity building was for it to be cumulative, sustainable and of high quality. He hoped that that would provide a new momentum to technical assistance which would be beneficial to developing countries and LDCs. His delegation commended the Director-General for having begun consultations regarding the IF. Before considering the substance of the proposed 2003 TA Plan, he agreed that the basis of the 2003 TA Plan should be the needs of beneficiary countries. In that regard, his delegation was grateful for the activities planned in Mauritania in the areas of capacity building and implementation of agreements. His delegation would cooperate with the Secretariat to achieve the aims that had been set out in the ambitious 2003 TA Plan.","WTCOMTDM42.pdf","Mauritania, Kenya, African, Group, Zambia, LDCs, Director-General, DDA, Director-General, Director-General, Mauritania, Secretariat"
"4440",4440,"46","46.      The representative of Australia said that, like other delegations, her delegation recognised the importance of technical assistance for developing and least-developed countries as a core element of the WTO's work. In that regard her delegation appreciated the comments made by the Director-General. Her delegation welcomed the Secretariat's efforts to draw on lessons from the 2002 TA Plan and recognised that while much work was being done to address issues of concern, Members had ongoing responsibilities to improve the 2003 TA Plan whenever possible. Recent discussions had highlighted the large number of requests for assistance received by the Secretariat. That raised concerns relating to the capacity of the Secretariat to respond to them. Her delegation welcomed efforts to address those issues by the provision of a more focused, sequenced and sustainable programme of assistance. Her delegation also wondered whether a stronger effort to integrate trade into development strategies would allow beneficiary countries to divert some types of requests to alternative responsible agencies, thereby allowing international organisations and donors to collaborate more effectively. Her Government was keen to ensure that the technical assistance mandates from the Doha Ministerial Declaration were met. Her Government supported an increased focus and responsibility for TRTA in other committees and working groups and was working to ensuring that its bilateral assistance was complimentary to the Secretariat's activities. Her delegation recognised the need to work together to analyse the needs of developing country members and the WT/COMTD/M/42 Page 22 need to consider ways of mainstreaming trade into national and regional development strategies. The shared goal was the delivery of effective, high quality assistance to Members. With respect to the Global Trust Fund, her Government was considering issues relating to further contributions and would need to study the document provided on the financial impact of the 2003 technical assistance training activities (CRP(02)/3). Being a donor, her Government had clear requirements for evaluations of activities and monitoring of the expenditures. She said that her delegation appreciated the Secretariat's efforts to ensure transparency in its reporting and evaluation work. Nevertheless, she asked the Secretariat to provide further information on the quality and effectiveness of the activities delivered under the 2002 TA Plan.","WTCOMTDM42.pdf","Australia, WTO, Director-General, Secretariat, Members, Secretariat, Secretariat, TRTA, Secretariat, Members, Secretariat, Secretariat"
"4441",4441,"47","47.       The representative of Uganda said that his delegation associated itself with the statement made by the representative of Kenya on behalf of the African Group, and the statement made by the representative of Zambia on behalf of the LDCs. His delegation had not had the time to study the 2003 TA Plan and would provide detailed comments on it at a later stage. However, his delegation was in a position to comment on the vision, objectives and approach of the 2003 TA Plan. He thanked the Director-General for having emphasised that technical assistance should be cumulative, sustainable and result in long term benefits. His delegation shared the view that, apart from the day-to-day training programmes, there was a need for the construction of trade infrastructure, which was not within the WTO's competence. However, the WTO had the leverage to coordinate with other organisations such as the World Bank, UNDP, and UNIDO to ensure that activities were sequenced in order to have maximum impact. The issue of collaboration with other institutions was important in implementing the 2003 TA Plan. His delegation had repeatedly said that the WTO was able to explain the rules, the consequences of not complying with them and give advice on how to comply. However, the WTO did not have the competence in all areas of interest to developing countries and there was a need for it to collaborate with other organisations. In some areas, such as the participation in negotiations, it was difficult for the Secretariat to give developing countries negotiating positions, as the WTO was a rule making body and as the Secretariat was servicing the negotiations. The WTO was not completely irrelevant in that respect, but cooperation with other relevant organisations would have positive impact. That was also true for capacity building for the effective participation of developing countries in trade. He said that the 2003 TA Plan should remain principally demand driven in that the beneficiary countries should define the needs. Any attempt to devise other means of needs identification would be a step in the wrong direction. In its PRSP programme, the World Bank emphasised consultation with the stakeholders. He did not know why the question of how to identify the needs had been raised. The needs had to be left to the Members to identify. The demand on the WTO to carry out a number of TA activities and at the same time to service negotiations was a dilemma for the WTO. On the one hand, Members needed technical assistance which involved the participation of a large part of the Secretariat. That might lead to difficulties in servicing the negotiations. On the other hand, without technical assistance, negotiations would be held with unprepared developing country delegations. Developing country Members would then sign agreements which they would not be able to implement because of a lack of capacity to do so. A balance between staff time spent on technical assistance and servicing negotiations was needed if Members were to move forward. The proposal made by the delegation of Canada with respect to the building of partnerships with other organisations was a possible solution.","WTCOMTDM42.pdf","Uganda, Kenya, African, Group, Zambia, LDCs, Director-General, WTO, WTO, World, Bank, UNDP, UNIDO, WTO, WTO, Secretariat, WTO, Secretariat, WTO, World, Bank, Members, WTO, WTO, Members, Secretariat, Members, Members, Canada"
"4442",4442,"48","48.     The representative of Barbados said that the presence of the Director-General and the DDGs' at the meeting served to highlight the importance given to technical assistance in the WTO. Her delegation thought that the strategic direction being adopted by the Secretariat in the elaboration of the 2003 Plan seemed well thought out. The strategic focus, in conjunction with the guiding principles that had been outlined, provided a framework within which the delivery of WTO technical assistance might be effectively carried out. She said that she wished to highlight a few issues which her delegation felt were of specific importance. The first was the question of the sustainability of the WTO's technical assistance and capacity building activities. There was no need to recall the importance of ensuring that TRTA and capacity building activities mandated at the Fourth Ministerial Conference received full implementation and follow through. With respect to the warning made not                                                                                     WT/COMTD/M/42                                                                                            Page 23 to allow a situation of donor fatigue to develop, she said that there was no space in the undertaking for donor fatigue. Second, her Government attached importance to coordination between agencies, donors and beneficiaries in the delivery of technical assistance. The aim of such coordination was to ensure that needs were identified and met and that no critical issue remained outside the jurisdiction of one institution or the other. It had to be ensured that nothing fell through the cracks. She had raised that point because the Secretariat had rightly identified what it could not do. Some donors in other fora had indicated the types of assistance that they would prefer to fund, either bilaterally or through other multilateral agencies. Members therefore needed to ensure that no type of assistance became left out in the process such as the issue of the development of commercial infrastructure. On the question of national versus regional activities, she said that while she agreed with the need to seek quality over quantity, technical assistance needed to be properly focused in order to be effective. Therefore, it was clear that a balance had to be struck between regional and national activities. The goal should be that of effective technical assistance delivery rather than ""the greater yield"".","WTCOMTDM42.pdf","Barbados, Director-General, WTO, Secretariat, WTO, WTO, TRTA, Secretariat, Members"
"4443",4443,"49","49.      She went on to say that her delegation had taken note of the Secretariat's comments on the issue of ""ad hocism"" and looked forward to a continued flexible delivery of WTO technical assistance both in the remainder of 2002 and in the 2003 TA Plan. She said that her delegation also welcomed the statement made by the Secretariat that technical assistance and market access were complementary not substitutes. The representative of South Africa had mentioned the issue of S&D and she said that Members needed to avoid the tendency of reducing S&D to technical assistance because the two were not substitutes either. She said that her delegation found it positive that the Secretariat recognised special challenges in some regions and welcomed that the Caribbean Community had been identified as a region facing significant trade policy and trade development challenges. In addition to the sub- regional institutions mentioned by the Secretariat, the Caribbean Development Bank was also involved in the developmental efforts of the Caribbean countries. Her delegation was pleased to see a commitment to continue ""Geneva week"". Many Caribbean countries were non-residents and ""Geneva week"" was an important tool for those Members. Her delegation also welcomed the new products in the 2003 TA Plan, which had been elaborated in the Secretariat largely by the Training Institute. Those included the training-of-trainers programme, the training courses for trade negotiators and the internships. Her delegation was interested in receiving more details on those new products. Her delegation was pleased that the decentralised regional trade policy courses in Nairobi and Casablanca had gone well. In those exercises Members could see not just the training of officials but the linkage between the WTO and academic institutions in the field, as well as the opportunity for the training of trainers. Her delegation looked forward to the evaluation of those programmes and to their extension to other regions such as the Caribbean region.","WTCOMTDM42.pdf","Secretariat, WTO, Secretariat, South, Africa, S&D, Members, Secretariat, Caribbean, Community, Secretariat, Caribbean, Development, Bank, Caribbean, Caribbean, Members, Secretariat, Training, Institute, Nairobi, Casablanca, Members, WTO, Caribbean"

"4445",4445,"50","50.      The representative of India said that in his introductory remarks, the Director-General had underscored the importance of quality over quantity in the delivery of technical assistance as well as the need to have cumulative, systemic, and sustainable capacity building. Many delegations had underscored the importance of those elements in their interventions. In that context, he reiterated that the technical assistance and capacity building efforts should not only be event-based, but lead to effective institutional and human resource development in the recipient countries. The Secretariat had broadly classified technical assistance and capacity building into three categories. Technical assistance for building effective capacity for trade negotiators, technical assistance for the understanding of the rules and their implementation, and technical assistance for the development of commercial infrastructure. As alluded to by a number of delegations, technical assistance in all three categories would be important for many developing countries and LDCs. His Government had submitted its requests for technical assistance and capacity building for 2003. However, it had subsequently been requested to identify two priority national activities, which would be incorporated in the 2003 TA Plan. Cutting down the requests had not been an easy task. It was clear from the documents containing the 2003 TA Plan and the presentation which had been made by Mr. Osakwe, that there was a gap between demand and supply. His delegation noted the new tools and activities included in the 2003 TA Plan such as outreach programmes and internship programmes for regional co-ordinators. The Secretariat documents had been only recently received by delegations and his WT/COMTD/M/42 Page 24 Government was still examining them. His delegation would comment on their substance at a later stage. While his delegation agreed that outreach programmes would be useful, it was not certain that the cost of those programmes should be financed from the technical assistance budget, which was meant for capacity building in developing countries. His delegation welcomed the Director-General's statement that the Secretariat's technical assistance objectives were not only focussed on the next WTO Ministerial Conference but also on establishing an architecture for WTO technical assistance. He said that there should not be a presumption that technical assistance and capacity building on certain issues would necessarily lead to some decisions at the Fifth Ministerial Conference. The purpose was to enable developing country Governments to better evaluate the implications of closer multilateral cooperation for their development policies and objectives, for them to be able to make informed decisions at the Cancun Ministerial Meeting.","WTCOMTDM42.pdf","India, Director-General, Secretariat, Osakwe, Secretariat, Director-General, Secretariat, WTO, WTO, Cancun, Ministerial, Meeting"
"4446",4446,"51","51.      The representative of the Czech Republic said that he was aware of the complexity involved in drawing up the 2003 TA Plan, given the resource limits Members faced, the large number of requests for technical assistance and the core business of the WTO, which was that of being a negotiating forum. His delegation was impressed by the number of activities proposed by the Secretariat as well as the ability of Members to identify their needs. It was apparent from the 2003 TA Plan that improved coordination and coherence within the Secretariat and with multilateral agencies and donors was more important than ever before. High quality technical assistance delivery and effective use of scarce resources should be the leading principles. The Director-General and others had mentioned that and his delegation shared those sentiments. It was important that technical assistance and capacity building remained focused on activities related to the implementation of the DDA. Equally important was to strike a geographical balance in terms of the Members that benefited from those types of activities. There was no doubt that priority attention would continue to be paid to developing and least-developed countries. However there were other Members who had specific needs and they had every right to claim access to the programmes organized and financed through the 2003 TA Plan. From that perspective, his delegation appreciated that the draft 2003 TA Plan attempted to respond to some of the needs of the countries in Central and Eastern Europe and to their interest in having continued access to the WTO technical assistance and capacity building activities. He said that there was a need to further develop relations between the WTO Secretariat and other regional and multilateral agencies which delivered technical assistance. His Government had experienced how beneficial such relations could be for all involved. An example was the close cooperation between the WTO Secretariat and the Joint Vienna Institute, which was a common destination for his Government's officials who took part in various activities related to trade and WTO.","WTCOMTDM42.pdf","Czech, Republic, Members, WTO, Secretariat, Members, Secretariat, Director-General, DDA, Members, Members, Eastern, Europe, WTO, WTO, Secretariat, WTO, Secretariat, Joint, Vienna, Institute, WTO"
"4447",4447,"52","52.     The representative of the Philippines said that she was pleased with the Director-General's policy statement, in particular that the WTO Secretariat would focus its technical assistance on what it did best, namely on technical assistance to build effective negotiation capacity, explaining the agreements, their implementation and the nuances of those agreements. She agreed with the representative of Canada that the Secretariat should not take on more responsibilities than it could handle. She said that there was a need for the Secretariat to coordinate with other institutions that were in a position to deliver the requested technical assistance. Her delegation was pleased to hear that WTO's technical assistance was not only geared towards the Cancun Ministerial Conference, but beyond it. That showed the commitment of the WTO to enable Members to become effective negotiators in the long run. The policy statement by the Director-General also mentioned coordination, which all Members could agree with. The Director-General had stated that the Secretariat would continue its coordination with other agencies and advocate the role technical assistance could play in the construction of commercial infrastructure if delivered in collaboration with development institutions and bilateral donors. The focus should be on quality and not quantity of WTO's technical assistance activities. She commended the Secretariat for the way in which it had accomplished the process of arriving at the 2003 TA Plan. She said that her delegation could claim ownership of the 2003 TA Plan because it had worked closely with the Secretariat in drawing it up. Like other delegations, her delegation had had to prioritise its requests. She said that the transparency                                                                                        WT/COMTD/M/42                                                                                               Page 25 shown was important. She had been surprised by the transparency shown in Annex 2 of document WT/COMTD/W/104/Add.1. She said that taking on board the lessons that the Secretariat had learnt from the implementation of the 2002 TA Plan was a move in the right direction. It was important to continue to learn from past experiences and find ways of improving TA delivery beyond the implementation of the 2002 TA Plan.                 In that connection, page 3 of document WT/COMTD/W/104/Add.1 provided a good summary of where things stood. She said that she had noticed that the number of national activities exceeded the number of regional activities. She had identified two specific national activities for the Philippines. The Secretariat should feel free to inquire from her delegation if it was prepared to convert those activities to regional activities that would enable more countries to benefit. The multiplier affect of regional activities for WTO Members would be enhanced if the venues of those activities were as dispersed as possible. With respect to the budget, she said that she sympathised with potential donors. She agreed with the suggestion by the representatives of the European Communities and Canada that Members receive information on how much of the 2002 budget had been spent and how much of it could be carried over to 2003.","WTCOMTDM42.pdf","Philippines, Director-General, WTO, Secretariat, Canada, Secretariat, Secretariat, WTO, Cancun, Ministerial, Conference, WTO, Members, Director-General, Members, Director-General, Secretariat, WTO, Secretariat, Secretariat, Secretariat, Philippines, Secretariat, WTO, Members, Canada, Members"
"4448",4448,"53","53.      The representative of Switzerland said that his delegation valued the efforts made by the Secretariat to enhance the quality and impact of its technical assistance in the face of increased requests from beneficiary countries. He agreed with the Secretariat that it was necessary to provide a sharp strategic direction for WTO technical assistance. His delegation welcomed the will to take account of the lessons drawn from the implementation of the 2002 Plan and of the suggestions made by the Membership at the High Level Meeting on Technical Cooperation in July 2002. In that respect, his delegation was of the opinion that special attention should be given to the technical cooperation audit carried out earlier in the year (WT/COMTD/W/97). The Audit had presented sound recommendations concerning inter alia objective setting for major groups of technical assistance projects and the need to give higher priority to the selection of participants of training activities. He said that it had been a deception for his delegation to notice that, in spite of the Secretariat's objective to limit ad hoc activities to a minimum, their level in 2002 continued to undermine the rationality of WTO TA Plans. Stricter and transparent measures had to be taken to bring those activities under control. So far 1038 requests for technical assistance had been communicated to the Secretariat for 2003. His delegation believed that that trend should be viewed positively since it showed a growing interest for TRTA among developing countries. However, it highlighted the necessity of sorting and rationalizing those demands. The idea proposed by the Secretariat to ensure that requests were linked to priorities identified by Members in their development plans and poverty reduction strategies was of utmost importance. His delegation approved of the direction taken by the Secretariat on that matter. At the same time, his delegation was aware that that would not be an easy task, since not all Members had plans that could help them identify the right priorities. For the future, Members might wish to search for solutions that strengthened the link between national plans and the delivery of technical assistance. The high number of demands forced Members to look for innovative solutions. The proposals presented in the 2003 TA Plan were interesting, such as grouping national requests into a regional activity, systematic and cumulative capacity building, and developing partnerships with other multilateral institutions. Partnerships with other multilateral institutions were necessary, especially in the fields beyond the direct competence of the WTO. In that connection, he asked for more information regarding the partnerships the Secretariat intended to be build with bilateral donors. He said that with respect to the delivery modes, his delegation feared that the trade clinics approach for special and immediate needs could end up increasing the number of ad-hoc activities. He said that the three pillars for the 2003 TA Plan, namely capacity building for effective negotiations, the legal implementation of WTO Agreements, and trade integration seemed appropriate. He agreed that the WTO needed to concentrate on its core competencies. He concluded by saying that the costing that had been proposed for the 2003 TA Plan had surprised his delegation. The 2003 TA Plan and its costing needed further consideration. In that sense, his delegation supported the request by the representatives of the European Commission and Canada that the Secretariat provide a detailed report on the implementation and accomplishment of the 2002 TA Plan so that Members would have a better view of what was possible for 2003.

"4449",4449,"54","54.      The representative of Norway said that her delegation was pleased to see that the elements in the 2003 TA Plan had been closely linked to the Doha Ministerial Declaration. That was the right way to move forward. Her delegation found part II on the ""Lessons from the Implementation of the 2002 Annual TA/CB Plan"" on page 5 in document WT/COMTD/W/104 useful, as those lessons could provide useful input to further improving the Plan. She said that bullet point 6 in paragraph 4 stated that recipient countries had expressed further needs for capacity building with a view to trade integration. She agreed with the representative of the European Commission and others that the WTO could not be expected to deliver such assistance, with the exception of coordinating cooperation with development organisations, bilateral donors and the recipient countries themselves. She said that her delegation would appreciate information from the Secretariat on any such additional assistance offered which went beyond the scope of the current work within the IF. It was necessary to anchor TRTA within the recipient countries, and integrate it with their PRSP's and their national development plans. She said that, as mentioned by the representative of Switzerland, her delegation believed that it was important to consider the long term effects of the proposed trade clinics and how to anchor them within the recipient countries themselves to ensure sustainability. Her delegation would appreciate the Secretariat's views as to whether those trade clinics would also cover ad-hoc requests. Concerning the requests for assistance from the 118 countries, her delegation had noted with interest that the Singapore issues ranked top of the list. Page 8 of document WT/COMTD/W/104 contained references to new guidelines that the Secretariat had been following during the drafting of the 2003 TA Plan. On page 19, in paragraph 48, the Secretariat had indicated the need for clearer guidelines with regard to how the DDAGTF might be used. Her delegation would appreciate further information with respect to any problems related to the allocation of the funds, and the reasoning behind the request for clearer guidelines. She concluded by underlining the need to give particular attention to the needs of the LDCs. In that respect, it was appropriate that 47 per cent of the national activities, as mentioned in paragraph 34, would, if adopted, take place in an LDC. Further follow-up of the IF for the TRTA delivered to LDCs would play a key part in the process of meeting the needs of LDCs.","WTCOMTDM42.pdf","Norway, European, Commission, WTO, Secretariat, TRTA, Switzerland, Secretariat, Singapore, Secretariat, Secretariat, TRTA, LDCs"
"4450",4450,"55","55.      The representative of Japan said that his delegation shared many of the views expressed by the Director-General in his introductory remarks. His delegation was aware that the Technical Cooperation Division had worked hard to reflect the lessons learnt from ongoing activities and would try to improve those activities in the 2003 TA Plan. He said that the cost estimate had surprised his delegation. His delegation believed, as mentioned by other delegations, that Members needed to be informed in detail of the 2002 activities before examining the cost of the 2003 TA Plan. The 2003 TA Plan could not be endorsed in isolation from its financial implications. Therefore, he agreed with the proposal made by the representative of Canada that there be a joint session between the CTD and the Committee on BFA. The needs of LDCs, developing countries and economies in transition went far beyond the practical responses that could be given by the WTO. His delegation had observed that TRTA was one of the areas where an excellent partnership among developed and developing countries had developed. He said that he appreciated the initiative taken by the delegations of South Africa and Canada to hold constructive discussions on that issue. His delegation was building further cooperative relations with Members on the issue of TRTA. Such a practise should be strengthened through constructive discussions in the CTD, aiming at pragmatic and practical solutions. In that regard his delegation was encouraged by the statement made by the representative of the Philippines. With respect to coordination with other agencies he said that his delegation understood that there were three pillars of activities. He believed that the WTO could be an advocate of the third pillar of technical assistance for the construction of commercial infrastructure while not directly dealing with the issue. Coordination with other international agencies was therefore important for developing countries to be integrated in the multilateral trading system. The Secretariat needed to inform Members of the detailed arrangements of such coordination, including information regarding co-financing arrangements for the joint activities carried out in 2002. During the discussions on the 2002 TA Plan his delegation had raised issues of flexibility. Ad hoc activities should not be allowed to damage the TA Plan. Flexibility had to be within acceptable margins of the 2003 TA Plan. Some delegations had mentioned that bilateral donors had been considering extending their bilateral technical assistance in the field of trade. However, due to the policy issues                                                                                    WT/COMTD/M/42                                                                                           Page 27 involved it was sometimes difficult for bilateral donors to implement that assistance alone. His Government was one such donor that had been working hard to collaborate with the WTO to extend assistance based on its own bilateral scheme to TRTA. That would be implemented with the cooperation of UNCTAD later in 2002. In addition, some developing countries had raised the point that they were willing to host such TRTA activities in their regions and in some cases they had done so. Considering those requests and the mood among the Members, his delegation believed that a certain amount of flexibility and a certain level of ad hoc activities might be permitted in order to respond to such positive action by Member countries. He concluded by saying that his delegation was concerned with some of the proposals made by the Secretariat, including the cost estimates. His delegation was ready to actively participate in the debate on TRTA in the CTD or in the Committee on BFA.","WTCOMTDM42.pdf","Japan, Director-General, Technical, Cooperation, Division, Members, Canada, CTD, Committee, BFA, WTO, South, Africa, Canada, Members, CTD, Philippines, WTO, Secretariat, Members, WTO, UNCTAD, Members, Member, Secretariat, TRTA, CTD, Committee, BFA"

The representative of Hungary said that her delegation believed that the technical assistance activities provided by the WTO effectively responded to the needs that emerged from the Mandate in the Doha Ministerial Declaration in order to promote the process for the Fifth Ministerial Conference. Her delegation was pleased that Central and Eastern European Countries were involved in some of the training programmes. Her Government's experiences with the training programmes were positive and the participation of her Government's experts in those programmes had deepened their knowledge in specific matters relating to the WTO. She hoped that similar participation would be possible in future WTO technical assistance activities.","WTCOMTDM42.pdf","Hungary, WTO, Doha, WTO, WTO"

He thanked the Director-General for his focus on the issue of technical assistance and capacity building for the implementation of the DDA and the training of negotiators in WTO matters. He said that in the 2003 TA Plan priority attention had been paid to the developing and the least-developed countries; however in that regard he pointed out that there were other countries with specific needs and interests resulting from difficult transformation processes and he hoped that the needs of economies in transition had been recognised in the preparation of the 2003 TA Plan. There were some activities on the national and regional level which would take place in Central and Eastern Europe and the geographical balance in terms of benefitting from those activities was well known. He thanked the Secretariat for the possibility of having continued access to WTO technical assistance and capacity building activities. His Government's experience was positive and it showed how essential the national seminars, training courses and other regional activities were. In that regard, he underlined the need for strengthening relations between the WTO Secretariat and agencies that delivered national and regional technical assistance activities. One of his Government's positive experiences was connected with the cooperation between the WTO Secretariat and the Joint Vienna Institute. He hoped that that would continue as both organisations would benefit from their efforts.","WTCOMTDM42.pdf","Slovak, Republic, Director-General, DDA, WTO, Eastern, Europe, Secretariat, WTO, WTO, Secretariat, WTO, Secretariat, Joint, Vienna, Institute"
"4453",4453,"58","58.      The representative of Hong Kong, China said that his delegation found the new ideas in the draft 2003 TA Plan interesting. Comments had been made on the concept of trade clinics. His delegation wished to hear in more detail how the concept of trade clinics would be implemented in practice and especially what the mechanism would be for making requests and what type of assistance the clinics would provide. His delegation appreciated the efforts to further cooperation with the international standard setting organisations on the issue of standards. That initiative was particularly welcomed as it related to one of the implementation issues that developing countries were concerned about. Some of them were of the view that technical standards could become an increasing barrier to trade when tariffs were lowered. He requested more information on how the WTO intended to increase cooperation with international standard setting organisations. His delegation welcomed the ideas of training trainers, involving academia and using WTO reference centres. In that regard, his delegation requested the Secretariat to provide updated information on the WTO reference centres, so that Members would get a better idea of the people involved and whether involvement in the reference centres could be enhanced. He said that he had noticed that the 2003 TA Plan covered many areas and that many of the requests submitted by Members might not be met. The fact that the draft 2003 WT/COMTD/M/42 Page 28 TA Plan had been produced in advance gave Members an overview of the global shape of it and enabled them to compare it with the overall objective of the DDA and to consider whether the 2003 TA Plan could fully meet the needs of developing countries. He noticed that a range of activities were already organised in some negotiating areas. However, in other areas relating to negotiations, such as trade facilitation, no global activity seemed to be planned. He asked Members whether that suited their needs from a negotiations point of view. His delegation agreed with the points raised by the representatives of the Philippines and Uganda regarding the supply side constraints of the Secretariat in providing technical assistance. In that regard he echoed the delegations which had called for a review of the implementation of the 2002 TA Plan. He said that it seemed that only a portion of the 2002 activities had been implemented. That was a reflection of the fact that the number of technical assistance activities had increased since 2001 and that Members needed to review the situation in order to ensure that the implementation of the 2003 TA Plan would not put unrealistic demands on the Secretariat which also had to service the negotiations. The Trade Negotiations Committee (TNC) had recently stated that those negotiations were going to intensify.","WTCOMTDM42.pdf","Hong, Kong, China, WTO, WTO, Secretariat, WTO, Members, Members, Members, DDA, Members, Philippines, Uganda, Secretariat, Members, Secretariat, Trade, Negotiations, Committee, TNC"
"4454",4454,"59","59.      The representative of the United States said that her Government was pleased with the demonstrated commitment of the Director-General, the Secretariat staff and the Membership to the critical task of providing TRTA and capacity building. She said that the development and the implementation of the 2002 TA Plan had been a challenge for the WTO. Members had undertaken a complex process and difficult challenges lay ahead. Her delegation was pleased that the Secretariat had noted Members concerns and had attempted to learn lessons from the experiences it had gained in 2002. Her delegation believed that a strategic approach was critical as Members moved forward. It was important that the Secretariat had chosen to focus its 2003 TA Plan on its areas of competence related to trade negotiations as well as implementation and long term integration. It was particularly important that the Secretariat would be working with other institutions to improve the quality of the jointly delivered programmes. The 2003 TA Plan represented an effort to rationalise Members' work. The effort to blend bilateral and regional programmes was important as was the effort to reduce the number of ad hoc activities although Members knew that flexibility was required in the area of TRTA. There was an attempt to have a range of shorter and longer-term projects to meet developing country needs and there was an effort to incorporate different approaches and new tools. Her delegation shared the views of others that Members had to find a way to make progress on technical assistance and capacity building while not undermining WTO's central task. There was a need to deliver real liberalisation for the whole trading system to benefit the global economy. She agreed with other delegations that it was important to consider how the Secretariat might cooperate with other organisations to deliver projects even in its core areas of competence. There was a lot of work to be done as technical assistance had to be delivered effectively while not undermining the servicing of negotiations.","WTCOMTDM42.pdf","United, States, Director-General, Secretariat, TRTA, WTO, Members, Secretariat, Members, Members, Secretariat, Secretariat, Members, Members, Members, WTO, Secretariat"
"4455",4455,"6","6.      The Chairman said that at previous meetings the Committee had had before it a number of outstanding requests for observer status. Those came from the League of Arab States, OPEC, the Gulf Organization for Industrial Consulting, the Organisation Internationale de la Francophonie and the Common Fund for Commodities. The positions of delegations were well known and on the record. He proposed that, unless there had been any recent change of position, Members revert to those requests at the next formal meeting of the CTD.","WTCOMTDM42.pdf","Chairman, Committee, League, of, Arab, States, OPEC, Gulf, Organization, for, Industrial, Consulting, Organisation, Internationale, de, la, Francophonie, Members, CTD"
"4456",4456,"60","60.      She went on to say that her delegation shared the concerns expressed by other donors regarding the costing of the 2003 TA Plan. It was reasonable for Members to expect that the cost would have remained roughly the same for approximately the same number of projects. The high estimated cost of the 2003 TA Plan presented donor delegations with a serious challenge to convince their budget authorities to be forthcoming. Donors would, in that light have to carefully consider the 2003 TA Plan. Her Government, like others would have to justify budgetary requests and demonstrate that money was spent effectively. The amounts spent through September on the projects in the 2002 TA Plan seemed surprisingly low to her Government and that made it even more difficult to argue for an increase in the WTO budget. Her delegation joined the delegation of Canada and others in calling for a full account of the spending on the 2002 TA Plan, including information on short term costs, long term projects and how to justify that some short term programmes were more expensive than long term ones. That was particularly important when delegations approached their budgetary authorities with such a large increase in expenditures. Her Government was a large bilateral donor in the area of trade-related technical assistance and capacity building and had contributed approximately US$620 million in that area in fiscal year 2002. It remained committed to trade-related technical assistance and capacity building and wished to keep contributing. However, a                                                                                    WT/COMTD/M/42                                                                                           Page 29 demonstrated effective management of the funds contributed was critical in that respect. Her delegation welcomed the effort on the part of Members to look into how future TRTA in the WTO could be made effective. It also welcomed the opportunity to work with the delegation of South Africa and other interested Members to ensure that the quality of TRTA would be constantly improved. Her delegation supported the proposal made by the representative of Canada that the 2003 TA Plan be reviewed in conjunction with the Committee on BFA.","WTCOMTDM42.pdf","Members, WTO, Canada, Members, TRTA, WTO, South, Africa, Members, Canada, Committee, BFA"
"4457",4457,"61","61.      The representative of El Salvador said that she also spoke on behalf of the delegation of Guatemala. She said that it was comforting to find a 2003 TA Plan that aimed to meet the specific needs of all countries in order to strengthen their negotiating capacity. She understood that the work of compiling the requests had not been easy. Her delegation had observed that amongst the activities scheduled for the Latin American region, there was no activity in the area of trade facilitation, which would help Latin American countries to remove the technical barriers that hampered trade. Taking into account the above, she was aware that UNIDO had approached the Latin American region to provide support and had a programme aimed at meeting the needs of those countries in the area of trade facilitation. She asked the Secretariat if the revised 2003 TA Plan would include the UNIDO programme or if there was another activity in conjunction with UNIDO that was in the process of being evaluated and that if for that reason had not been included in the programme. As an example of the urgent need she cited the results of a study which showed that 50 per cent of the problems occurring in intra-regional trade were related to the issue of trade facilitation, such as procedures, customs valuation, and transparency. She said that the Central American Vice-Presidents had attended a UNIDO Meeting in Vienna the previous week to support the programme that seemed to be generating increased competitiveness in the area. She emphasised the fact that other programmes existed in other organisations such as the World Trade Net in the ITC which could also play a role in the negotiations of WTO agreements, such programmes could be a good compliment to the work carried out by the WTO.","WTCOMTDM42.pdf","El, Salvador, Guatemala, UNIDO, Secretariat, UNIDO, UNIDO, UNIDO, Vienna, ITC, WTO, WTO"

The representative of Mexico said that following what had been said by the representative of Sri Lanka he wished to clarify that the comments that had been made by his delegation were intended for the Secretariat to review. While he believed that institutional capacity was most important there were clearly situations where human capacity building was necessary as well.","WTCOMTDM42.pdf","Mexico, Sri, Lanka, Secretariat"
"4459",4459,"63","63.       The representative of China said that her delegation was aware that the drawing up of the 2003 TA Plan had involved a lot of work and that it had been necessary to take many elements into consideration to complete the effort. She noted that the Plan had been improved by learning from experiences from the 2002 TA Plan and that the 2003 TA Plan therefore presented more practical and flexible TRTA in favour of developing countries. As a newly acceded Member, her Government had conducted a series of seminars, workshops and training courses to improve the public awareness of the WTO and its rules. Since there were numerous domestic demands in that regard, the technical assistance that had been delivered by the WTO had played an important role to contribute to institutional and legal capacity building in her Government. An aspect worth highlighting was the delivery mode of technical assistance. She agreed that it was the quality and not the quantity of TA that counted. Her delegation regarded the content of the technical assistance delivered to be the critical issue. Seminars which presented general ideas or broad WTO rules were normally ineffective since such knowledge was not easily put into practice in specific economic environments. Therefore, her delegation suggested that future technical assistance activities be more focused.","WTCOMTDM42.pdf","China, Member, WTO, WTO, WTO"
"4460",4460,"64","64.      The representative of Romania said that, as a developing country in Eastern Europe, her Government attached great importance to technical assistance as a tool for economic development through improved participation in the multilateral trading system. The draft 2003 TA Plan was an important step in the direction of making technical assistance more focused and tailored to the needs of different groups of Members. It appeared to be well structured and included the contribution of other institutions. Her delegation found the 2003 TA Plan to be in accordance with the Doha Ministerial Declaration. She was pleased that several technical assistance activities would benefit WT/COMTD/M/42 Page 30 officials from her country even if not all the activities her delegation had requested had been included. Several delegations had mentioned that the cost of the 2003 TA Plan was too high. She said that her delegation was of the view that no amount was too large when spent on that form of education if the overall budget so allowed. At the same time, she said that her delegation supported the idea of having an accurate account of the cost of each technical assistance project. When working with the Secretariat on technical assistance matters, her Government had supported the inclusion of a project proposal received from an academic institution in Romania for a network of regional WTO centres. She asked for more information on that proposal. Involving academia in all WTO matters was one of the best ways to ensure a stable country and region.","WTCOMTDM42.pdf","Romania, Eastern, Europe, Members, Secretariat, Romania, WTO, WTO"
"4461",4461,"65","65.      The representative of Indonesia said that the Director-General had mentioned his commitment to make the 2003 TA Plan a success and to ensure that it would benefit the recipient countries, especially the developing and least-developed countries. Technical assistance was a core element of the WTO's work to develop the capacity of developing and least-developed countries to participate in the global market. That was one way of increasing the level playing field of developing and least-developed countries vis à vis their developed training partners. His Government was one of those that had received WTO technical assistance for capacity building. However, bearing in mind the broad scope of the WTO agreements, his delegation was of the view that the WTO technical assistance programmes should not be limited to only a few agreements. Due to the lack of capacity and a limited understanding of the costs and benefits of the current negotiations, it was difficult for developing country governments like his own to limit their requests for technical assistance. He was aware of the Secretariat's limited human resources to meet Members' requests for technical assistance. He highlighted the urgent need for increased collaboration between the WTO and other relevant international organisations and having bilateral donor countries working together with the Secretariat. Such collaboration would be important in light of the limited resources that the Secretariat possessed. It was his delegation's view that to increase the quality and effectiveness of the technical assistance plans, the Secretariat should evaluate the 2002 TA Plan and report to Members.","WTCOMTDM42.pdf","Indonesia, Director-General, WTO, WTO, WTO, WTO, Secretariat, Members, WTO, Secretariat, Secretariat, Secretariat, Members"
"4462",4462,"66","66.     The representative of Oman said that, as a recently acceded country with extensive market access commitments, her delegation was surprised to find that it had only been granted two technical assistance activities for 2003. That would not assist her Government's efforts to implement the commitments that it had undertaken in its accession negotiations, especially as her Government had not been granted any transitional periods for implementing the WTO Agreements. Her delegation believed that the assistance given to recently acceded Members should be increased. Her Government would only be able to implement its commitments if the Secretariat increased the number of activities. She was aware that some Members were concerned with the cost of the 2003 Plan and might try to reduce it. However, that would also mean reducing Members' implementation efforts.","WTCOMTDM42.pdf","Oman, WTO, Members, Secretariat, Members, Members"

He said that his delegation would appreciate if future agendas included the possibility of commenting on the 2003 TA Plan in light of the 2002 TA Plan. That would ensure consistency and efficiency. It would be beneficial if some flexibility was applied to the requests presented by Members.","WTCOMTDM42.pdf","Ecuador, Members"

Her delegation welcomed the initiatives that had been taken by the Director-General and the innovative new activities that had been highlighted by the staff of the Technical Cooperation Division. Her delegation hoped for enhanced cooperation between the WTO and regional institutions in the African region. She also hoped that supply side constraints would be addressed. There should be some flexibility in addressing ad hoc requests for technical assistance.","WTCOMTDM42.pdf","Zimbabwe, Kenya, African, Group, Director-General, WTO"
"4465",4465,"69","69.    The Chairman said that the 2003 TA Plan submitted by the Technical Cooperation Division was in many ways unique. It had been drafted well before its commencement date of January 2003.

Its early circulation gave Members time to review it. He said that, keeping in mind that Members had not had sufficient time to study the 2003 TA Plan and that several changes had been proposed, he suggested that the Secretariat should revise the 2003 TA Plan according to the comments made. The Committee would meet again to consider it. He noted that several delegations had asked for an account of the performance of the 2002 TA Plan and he believed that a brief performance report could be provided. He proposed that Members meet again on Monday, 11 November at 3 p.m. to discuss the 2003 TA Plan. A suggestion had been made for the CTD and the Committee on BFA to meet jointly and that was something that would be taken up with the Committee on BFA. There were some technical problems in having a joint meeting. He said that he was aware that the Committee on BFA would be meeting on 11 and 12 November but he was not aware what the agenda contained and whether they would be willing to discuss the 2003 TA Plan. An Airgram inviting Members to a meeting on 11 November would be circulated.","WTCOMTDM42.pdf","Chairman, Members, Members, Secretariat, Committee, Members, CTD, Committee, BFA, Committee, BFA, Committee, BFA, Members"

Those two notes were self-explanatory so unless there was a request for it, he would not ask the Secretariat to make any general introduction to them.

They related in particular to the courses in Nairobi and Casablanca that were currently under evaluation. She said that many delegations had stated how important those courses had been for the training of their country officials and she asked when the evaluation would be completed. She also asked which elements of that training programme were securely funded. That was a question that also arose with respect to the budget that had been presented earlier which seemed to include elements that were traditionally funded out of the regular budget. In addition, her delegation wondered which activities were to be funded from the Trust Fund and which were to be funded from the regular budget.","WTCOMTDM42.pdf","Canada, Nairobi, Casablanca"
"4472",4472,"75","75.     Mr. Mercier, Director, Training Institute said that the Secretariat was aiming to have a final evaluation of the Nairobi and Casablanca courses by the end of October. The two courses had just been completed. Reports were being received from the resource people that had been used from both within and outside the Secretariat. The Secretariat was awaiting reports from the two institutions with WT/COMTD/M/42 Page 32 which the Secretariat had the partnership agreement. The assessments the Secretariat had received from the participants were in the process of being reviewed. It was an inter-divisional exercise which was being conducted under Mr. Rolian's Audit Unit. The Director-General would provide observations in due course. In response to the second question posed by the representative of Canada, he said that the Secretariat, in the annex to the document WT/COMTD/W/103, had attempted to identify where the funding was available, where there was no need for additional funds and where traditional activities of the Training Institute were normally financed by the regular budget. He said that the 5th Specialized Course on Dispute Settlement shown in row 5 on page 4, was provided for in the costing estimate that had been provided by DDG Abbott. That type of course was traditionally financed by other sources such as Trust Fund type of money, though it existed long before the Trust Fund came into being. Such courses were mandated by the Dispute Settlement Understanding (DSU) and did not constitute ad hoc requests. They were addressed to all Members of the WTO, not just to the developing countries. In each of those courses the participation of up to 10 participants from LDCs was financed. The Secretariat did not fund the participation of other developing or developed country participants. The induction days did not involve any costs as they were one-day activities. The trade policy courses were part of the institutional mandate dating back to 1956. The only caveat would be the courses that would be held in 2003. Due to the Conference 'ITU Telecom World 2003', the Secretariat would not be able to deliver more than one course, if it could even carry out one. That was due to the fact that there would be no rooms available in or around Geneva during the duration of that Conference. Even the traditional lodgers could not be used for the participants because they could charge up to five times the price of a room charged to the WTO. If the Secretariat could not arrange even one course, it would attempt to reallocate the money usually allocated for the three- month trade policy courses to the 2-3 week specialised courses carried out under the same mandate. Those might deal with specialised topics or they could be trade negotiation skills seminars. He said that what he had mentioned about the 5th Specialized Course on Dispute Settlement also applied for those courses. Since the decision of the Committee on BFA in 2001, the two three-week courses for LDCs (one in French and one in English) that used to be financed out of Trust Fund money had become part of the regular budget due to the trade-off in the Budget 2002 exercise between symposia and those courses in terms of financing from the Trust Fund. Where financing was lacking was for the training of trainers programme. That was a separate programme having been put forward in the 2003 TA Plan. The first phase of that programme in 2002 was financed from the Trust Fund. He said that that activity had been put under the regular budget requests for 2003. If the Committee on BFA turned it down then it would have to be considered under the Trust Fund. The distance learning was a continuation of the programme that was agreed in 2001 and the money had already been partly accounted for in the 2002 formulation of the budget over two years. That left the university networking activity for which no funding was available in addition to the constrained human resources. It was hard to develop a network with universities especially when they all wished to set up training institutes or required the WTO to provide other resources, including human resources. In 2002 alone the Secretariat had received several requests for such activities but had not received any funds. The Secretariat had therefore proposed a modest programme in the regular budget for 2003 in the hope that something could be developed, time and resources permitting. The Secretariat had been asked to carry out 16 courses with the same amount of staff because only a few new posts had been provided in 2001 and the recruitment of new staff had not been finalised. He encouraged Members to consider that programme as a best endeavour approach. If the resources were made available, then the Secretariat would do its best to deliver, the programme would otherwise have to be curtailed. He concluded by saying that the budget of the Training Institute was being discussed in detail in the Committee on BFA.","WTCOMTDM42.pdf","Mercier, Director, Training, Institute, Secretariat, Nairobi, Secretariat, Secretariat, Secretariat, Secretariat, Rolian, Director-General, Canada, Secretariat, Training, Institute, DDG, Abbott, Members, WTO, Secretariat, ITU, Secretariat, Geneva, WTO, Secretariat, Committee, BFA, Trust, Fund, Trust, Fund, Committee, BFA, Trust, Fund, WTO, Secretariat, Secretariat, Secretariat, Members, Secretariat, Training, Institute, Committee, BFA"

The Chairman had said that there would be changes to the documents. He said that he therefore assumed that the changes would relate to all the documents so as to retain the equilibrium. If the changes related to just one document, then his delegation would need to study all the documents before accepting them.

"4479",4479,"81","81.      Mr. Low, Director, Development and Economic Research Division, said that the situation, as far as the Secretariat understood, was that any regional trade agreement (RTA) had to be notified to the WTO. Depending on the legal cover sought, Article XVIII, GATS Article V, or the Enabling Clause, the notifications would be sent to the Council for Trade in Goods, the Council for Trade in Services or the CTD. A notification would never be sent directly to the CRTA. The decision to refer the notification to the CRTA remained with the body which had received the notification, and it was up to them to set the terms of any examination by the CRTA. The CRTA in practice only examined what had been referred to it. There was thus no legal requirement to notify the CRTA as such. What had happened in practice was that the process of referring agreements notified under Article XXIV to the CRTA for examination had become more or less automatic, it was a growing practice in the case of RTAs notified under Article V of the GATS, but it was rare for notifications of RTAs under the Enabling Clause to be referred to the CRTA. In fact, the MERCOSUR Agreement was the only one that had been referred to the CRTA.","WTCOMTDM42.pdf","Low, Director, Development, and, Economic, Research, Division, Secretariat, RTA, WTO, Council, for, Trade, in, Goods, Council, for, Trade, in, Services, CTD, CRTA, CRTA, CRTA, CRTA, CRTA, CRTA, CRTA, CRTA"

To the extent that the two notifications related to measures in favour of LDCs, they had been forwarded to the Sub-Committee on LDCs for substantive consideration and reporting back, according to the reporting procedures agreed to at the 32nd Session of the CTD. However, it had been pointed out at the last meeting that the overall Generalized System of Preferences (GSP) Scheme to which the notifications referred was for the CTD to consider, so the notifications did not exclusively apply to the LDCs.","WTCOMTDM42.pdf","Chairman, Japan, Switzerland, CTD, GSP, CTD"

His delegation had understood the questions posed at the last meeting to relate to how the Government of Japan would manage the ceiling quotas for industrial products and to the relation between those quotas and the GSP scheme for the LDCs. The answer was that the industrial products to which the Government of Japan applied the ceiling quotas would not be affected by its GSP scheme for LDCs. As earlier explained, the GSP scheme for LDCs already included tariff and quota-free treatment for 99 per cent of the imports into Japan of industrial products from LDCs. The GSP scheme for LDCs was a separate scheme which did not affect the ceiling quotas for industrial products. With respect to the management of the ceiling quotas for industrial products, he said that the Government of Japan granted preferential tariffs on 81 industrial product groups. The ceilings in the GSP scheme related to the total value or quantity of each product group and was provided at the beginning of each fiscal year. The fiscal year in Japan began on 1 April. The most-favoured nation rate of duty would apply after the ceilings had been exceeded. The preferential treatment would also be suspended for a particular product group with reference to a particular preference receiving country if preferential imports originating in that country exceeded a maximum amount of 20 percent of the total value or quantity of the ceiling. The Government of Japan determined the amount of imports from a particular country based on the customs statistics in Japan. There might therefore be some differences between the reality and the statistics once the statistics were finalized. However, the Government of Japan attempted to apply the maximum 20 per cent country amount as far as possible since it would allow more countries to enjoy the preferences.","WTCOMTDM42.pdf","Japan, GSP, Japan, Japan, GSP, Japan, LDCs, GSP, LDCs, Japan, GSP, LDCs, Japan, GSP, Japan, Japan, Japan, Japan"

"4484",4484,"86","86.      The Chairman said that agenda item F related to the participation of developing countries in world trade. The CTD had the mandate to keep under continuous review the participation of developing country Members in the multilateral trading system. In order to assist the Committee to fulfill that part of its Mandate, the Secretariat had produced a paper contained in document WT/COMTD/W/100. The item had been kept on the agenda as some delegations had expressed the wish to have more time to study the paper. A request had also been made at the last meeting for the                                                                                        WT/COMTD/M/42                                                                                               Page 35 Secretariat to provide country-specific information of the aggregated regional analysis presented in the paper. Addendum 1 to the document (WT/COMTD/W/100/Add.1.) aimed to respond to that request.","WTCOMTDM42.pdf","Chairman, CTD, Members, Committee, Secretariat, Secretariat"
"4485",4485,"87","87.      The representative of the United States said that her delegation believed that the Addendum provided more detailed information on a country-by-country basis. She noted that the well researched report mainly focussed on trade trends which her delegation believed to be an important piece of the picture. However, her delegation wondered whether it would be possible to look into some of the other factors that assisted Members to increase their participation in trade, such as considering the trade-policy review mechanism and extract indicators which would assist Members to get a broader sense of the participation of developing countries in world trade. She was not aware of how much work that would involve. Nevertheless, to look at trends meant to only consider one part of the picture. A broader focus would be of benefit to the Committee.","WTCOMTDM42.pdf","United, States, Members, Members, Committee"
"4486",4486,"88","88.     The representative of Paraguay said that his delegation had not had enough time to study the Addendum in detail. However, he realized that it related to a disaggregation of the data that had been provided in the earlier document. His delegation would comments on the paper at the next meeting of the Committee.","WTCOMTDM42.pdf","Paraguay, Committee"
"4487",4487,"89","89.     The Chairman said that he believed that the suggestion made by the representative of the United States to work with other processes within the WTO and to benefit from possible synergies was an excellent one. He suggested that the Committee take note of that suggestion and attempted to do something about it.","WTCOMTDM42.pdf","Chairman, United, States, WTO, Committee"
"4488",4488,"9","9.      The Chairman went on to say that there were four sub-items under agenda item C. Dr. Supachai would offer overall introductory comments on the subject of WTO Technical Assistance. Thereafter, the Director of Technical Cooperation, Mr. Osakwe, would inform the CTD of the process of drawing up the 2003 Technical Assistance (TA) Plan, explain the main features of the requests received and, briefly highlight key details of the Plan. DDG Mr. Abbott, would then make a statement on the financial implications of the 2003 TA Plan. Sub-items (i), (ii) and (iii) of the agenda item would thus be covered together and sub-items (iv) and (v) relating to training would be covered after the conclusion of the discussions on the 2003 TA Plan.","WTCOMTDM42.pdf","Chairman, Supachai, WTO, Technical, Assistance, Director, Osakwe, CTD, Abbott"

"4490",4490,"91","91.       The Chairman said that the Committee had decided to keep an item relating to Paragraph 51 of the Doha Ministerial Declaration as a standing item on the agenda. Paragraph 51 related to the identifying and debating developmental and environmental aspects of the negotiations in order to help achieve the objective of having sustainable development appropriately reflected. The issue of sustainable development had also been the subject of the informal consultations held on 10 September 2002, shortly after the Johannesburg World Summit on Sustainable Development (WSSD). At the informal consultation, it had been agreed that, at the CTD Meeting, the Committee might also consider the negotiated documents that emerged from the WSSD. The documents had been circulated in multi-symbol document WT/COMTD/W/106 - WT/CTE/W/220, as the CTE also wished to consider them. He hoped that delegations had been able to consider the contents. One of the issues that the Committee might wish to consider was how the outcome of the WSSD should be treated in the context of the WTO in general, and the CTD in particular. He urged delegations to address both the substantive elements of Paragraph 51 as well as the developmental aspects of the outcome of the WSSD, and to indicate how views that had been expressed in the latter might fit into the work of the CTD. He said that he believed that Members would welcome any new suggestion that delegations might wish to offer. As there were no requests for the floor, the Chairman said that it seemed clear that delegations still required time to consider all aspects of the topic.","WTCOMTDM42.pdf","Chairman, Committee, Johannesburg, Committee, CTE, Committee, WTO, CTD, CTD, Members, Chairman"

"4492",4492,"93","93.      The Chairman invited Members to move on to address Agenda Item H relating to GATT Article XVIII as one of the outstanding implementation issues. The Secretariat had been asked to produce background documents relating to how Article XVIII had been applied in the WTO and in the GATT. The result of the Secretariat's analysis was contained in documents WT/COMTD/39 and its Addendum 1 (WT/COMTD/39/Add.1). He said that he believed that the questions before the Committee were how it should deal with Article XVIII, excluding Section B, as an outstanding implementation issue, what delegations wished to get out of the consideration of it, and what the goal of the reporting in December should be. At the informal meeting in September, the delegation of Sri Lanka had noted that the Secretariat documents had indicated that Sri Lanka had invoked Article XVIII in the past. However, the records in the Mission of Sri Lanka did not indicate what difficulties the delegation had faced in invoking the Article. The delegation, therefore, asked the Secretariat for information on traces in WTO records of any difficulties the Government of Sri Lanka might have encountered in invoking Article XVIII.","WTCOMTDM42.pdf","Chairman, Members, GATT, Secretariat, WTO, GATT, Secretariat, Committee, Sri, Lanka, Secretariat, Sri, Lanka, Sri, Lanka, Secretariat, WTO, Sri, Lanka"
"4493",4493,"94","94.     Mr. Low, Director, Development and Economic Research Division, said that the Secretariat had attempted to search for information with respect to the invocation of the Government of Sri Lanka of Article XVIII. It seemed that Article XVIII had been invoked eight times by the Government of Sri Lanka. The Secretariat had compiled the documents with respect to the invocations by the Government of Sri Lanka, referred to in the footnotes of the Secretariat documents WT/COMTD/W/39 and its Addendum 1, and provided those to the delegation of Sri Lanka. The Secretariat was diffident about attempting to make judgements about what difficulties were associated with the invocations. The Secretariat could compile the documents referred to into some kind of working document if that was helpful. However, he did not believe that the Secretariat was in a position to carry out an analysis of difficulties encountered by Members in the process of invoking different WTO provisions. That would have to be left to the judgement of the Members concerned.","WTCOMTDM42.pdf","Low, Director, Development, and, Economic, Research, Division, Secretariat, Sri, Lanka, Sri, Lanka, Secretariat, Sri, Lanka, Secretariat, Sri, Lanka, Secretariat, Secretariat, Secretariat, Members, WTO, Members"
"4494",4494,"95","95.      The representative of Sri Lanka said that his delegation was grateful for the information provided. He said that information regarding the practical experience of the use of Article XVIII:C had to be provided by Members. The Government of Sri Lanka had used Article XVIII:C in a particular situation at a particular time as the economic circumstances and the trade policies being followed at that time were quite different from the current situation of the country. His country had faced balance-of-payments difficulties in the 1940's and 1950's and there had been other economic development constraints. A different trade policy regime had therefore been followed in the 1940's and 1950's. For example, an import licences schemes had been restricting foreign exchange allocations. It was against that background that the Government of Sri Lanka had invoked Article XVIII at that time. From 1977 onwards, as the trade policy context had changed,, the Government of Sri Lanka had followed a more liberal economic policy under which import licence requirements and exchange rate controls had been abolished.","WTCOMTDM42.pdf","Sri, Lanka, Members, Sri, Lanka, Sri, Lanka, Sri, Lanka"
"4495",4495,"96","96.      The Chairman said that the comments made by the representative of Sri Lanka reflected the fact that the philosophy of trade and its relationship with development had been evolving over time. He went on to say that, at the informal meeting in September, the delegation of India had made reference to its submission in document WT/GC/W/363 of 12 October 1999. The delegation of India had also suggested an in-depth analysis of each provision of Article XVIII to identify the elements preventing developing countries from making use of those provisions and that contributions from Members, including experience from Members that had invoked the provisions, would be useful in that respect.                                                                                    WT/COMTD/M/42                                                                                           Page 37","WTCOMTDM42.pdf","Chairman, Sri, Lanka, India, India, Members, Members"
"4496",4496,"97","97.       The representative of India said that Ministers at the Doha Ministerial Conference had given a clear mandate for a complete review of Article XVIII with a view to ensure that it served the original objective of facilitating the progressive development of economies in developing countries and to allow them to implement the programmes and policies of economic development designed to raise the general standard of living of their people. Article XVIII was not a new issue. It had been on the agenda since before the Seattle Ministerial Conference. Her delegation had been flagging the issue of a review of Article XVIII as her delegation believed that Article XVIII was the most important S&D provisions, the implementation of which should serve the basic objective of development. Her delegation had also explained at considerable length the rational behind seeking a review of Article XVIII. There was a need to clarify the procedural ambiguities which prevented its effective utilisation. The Secretariat papers noted that Article XVIII had been replaced twice. Once in 1948 and the second time in 1957. The objective underlying the last change was to represent and accord a new and more positive approach to the problem of economic development and to the ways and means of reconciling the requirements of economic development with obligations undertaken under the GATT regarding the conduct of commercial policy. Considering the obligations that Members had on account of a changed and increasingly competitive trading environment and the balance that needed to be struck with developmental imperatives, there was a need to re-examine and reassess Article XVIII so as to make it more user friendly and geared towards integrating developing countries faster into the multilateral trading system.","WTCOMTDM42.pdf","India, Doha, Ministerial, Conference, Seattle, Ministerial, Conference, Secretariat, GATT, Members"
"4497",4497,"98","98.      She further said that developing countries were finding it increasingly difficult to have recourse to the provisions under Article XVIII on account of the almost punitive provisions of compensation which would actually nullify the impact of the development measures taken by them for raising the general standards of living. The ability of a Member, in the process of development of its economy, to offer additional concessions or face suspension of concessions of other measures being taken by the Member to promote industrial development was limited. Thus, where Members were satisfied that all reasonable efforts had been made to consult, by the member seeking to invoke the provisions of Article XVIII, then for the purposes of paragraphs 7.(b) and 18.(b) of Article XVIII, as the case might be, shall be sufficient for WTO Members, acting jointly, to concur in the proposed measure without the member having to offer additional concessions or having to face temporary suspension of concessions. It might be recalled that her delegation had initially made that proposal in document WT/GC/W/363 of 12 October 1999. In addition to making a determination that the economic benefits accruing to the member using Article XVIII far outweighed the adverse impact on global trade of that measure it was important to establish that there was a significant negative impact on the exports of another Member. Suspension of equivalent concessions or demands for additional compensation did otherwise not appear to be justified. Her delegation also felt that there was a need to amend Article XVIII:C, particularly paragraph 13 by adding the words ""development of a particular industry"" to the already existing objective of Section C of ""establishment of a particular industry"". Further, her delegation had earlier indicated that the procedures under paragraphs 14 to 21 of Article XVIII also required reconsideration. Under the present system, the member resorting to Section C of Article XVIII had first to seek the concurrence of the contracting parties which shall, inter alia, consult as to the purpose of the proposed measures, alternative measures available under other provisions, effect of the proposed measure on the economic and commercial interest of other contracting parties. Even after all that had been done, any other contracting party substantially effected could take action to withdraw equivalent concessions. As indicated by her delegation, that would defeat the objective of seeking to initiate the proposed measures. Her delegation therefore urged Members to consider those suggestions in order to further clarify and improve the elements which were currently hampering the effective use of Article XVIII by developing country members.","WTCOMTDM42.pdf","Member, Member, Members, WTO, Members, Member, Members"
"4498",4498,"99","99.     The representative of the United States said that her delegation wished to address two points. The first related to the overall Article XVIII review and the second specifically to Section C of Article XVIII. Her delegation had reviewed recent information and records of the CTD discussions over the past year. Her delegation was still not persuaded that a current review was warranted. No compelling arguments or new information had been presented to change that view. Her delegation WT/COMTD/M/42 Page 38 was still prepared to listen to any new ideas and to reflect on them. Much time had been spent on implementation issues of the last few years, including tiret 3. She recalled substantial consideration as part of the Uruguay Round of negotiations as well. That might be an area where there was no consensus to move forward. With regard to Article XVIII:C her delegation continued to believe that it should only be used after recourse to all other WTO mechanisms had been exhausted. Members currently had recourse to the Agreement on Safeguards and Countervailing Duties and the understanding of balance-of-payments. Those provisions had served the needs of the international community well. At the Doha Ministerial Conference, Members had agreed to a rules discussion. However, no consensus had been reached to open negotiations on Article XVIII. She asked Members what had changed.","WTCOMTDM42.pdf","United, States, CTD, Uruguay, WTO, Members, Doha, Ministerial, Conference, Members, Members"

As indicated by the Airgram, he proposed that that Session be devoted to technical cooperation and training and the draft Annual Report. He said that it had been difficult to circulate the draft annual report in advance of the meeting because the Sub-Committee on Least-Developed Countries (LDCs) had held its final meeting of the year on 7 November 2002. However, the draft annual report had been circulated and copies had been made available to Members. He said that Members would have an opportunity to comment on the draft Annual Report at the end of that day's meeting. He further said that for those who wished to study it further, comments could also be given to the Secretariat during the course of the week but had to be given on the afternoon of 14 November 2002 at the latest. He intended to put the draft Annual Report before the Committee for adoption on 18 November 2002. 1.     The last five activities (the national activities) would be moved to the section entitled ""Capacity Building"", (on pages 8-14). 1.      In connection with its consideration of the proposed Coordinated WTO Secretariat Annual TA Plan for 2003, several delegations commented on the importance they attach to the monitoring and evaluation of WTO TA activities. Two types of feedback appear to be desired by Members:         (a)     periodic reports on implementation of the agreed plan, including financial                 implications; this is a matter which should be taken up by the Technical Cooperation                 Division in the framework of its established procedures for reporting on the progress                 made in the implementation of the TA Plan;         (b)     qualitative evaluation of the activities, i.e. evaluation of performance. Delegations                 noted that they considered this to be critical for them in determining their attitude                 towards the annual TA plan.","WTCOMTDM43.pdf","Chairman, Members, Members, Secretariat, Committee, Coordinated, WTO, Secretariat, WTO, Members, Technical, Cooperation, Division"

The representative of Mexico said that he was trying to find a solution to the issues raised and asked whether there was a precedent to the effect that the CTD had to consult with other relevant Committees before organizing an event on topics relating to the competence of other committees. Although it might be interesting to hear the views of the CTE on the trade and environment symposium he was concerned with the underlying systemic consequences if the CTD would have to consult with other committees before taking a decision. That was something that Members needed to consider. He also asked whether any guidelines existed which stated that Missions and Ministries of Economy or Foreign Relations were the only acceptable channels for sending TA requests.","WTCOMTDM43.pdf","Mexico, CTD, CTE, CTD, Members"
"4516",4516,"103","103.     The representative of the European Communities said that the next meeting of the CTE was scheduled to be held in February 2003 which did not help Members as they needed to adopt the 2003 TA Plan quickly. He said that over the past four years the question of the environment symposium had not been dealt with in the CTE but had been dealt with at the General Council level at the request of the Director-General. That had also happened in 1999 and would practice to follow. Members were called to approve a draft 2003 TA Plan, the content of which had been known to Members since 8 October 2002. His delegation had been working on the basis that as a donor, his delegation would be asked to accept the draft 2003 TA Plan in total and to make money available for the activities in the Plan. It would cause problems to his delegation if two if a number of activities were taken out only days before the adoption of the Plan, because his delegation had considered the possibilities of funding the draft 2003 TA Plan on its entire content. His delegation could not agree to a plan from which a number of activities which were important to some of his delegation's constituencies were taken out at the last minute. That could be compared with the fact that the Committee would not agree to the removal, at the last minute, of some SPS and TBT activities which were important to other delegations. His delegation could therefore not accept a compromise where part of the national activities were moved elsewhere and all the regional workshops were removed. His delegation was willing to ensure that the issues were presented in a way that made sense and accept that they were not labelled as TA. If a delegation wished to question an activity scheduled to be held in its country, as the delegations of India and Costa Rica had indicated, his delegation agreed that they could be given time to consult their capitals. The activity would only be carried out if the capital agreed. It would otherwise be cancelled. He believed that the 2003 TA Plan needed to be adopted in its entirety. If Members could not agree on the issue of the trade and environment symposium, then Members would have to request the Director-General to follow past practice and it would probably end just as the symposium was proposed in the revised plan. However, if Members could not agree on that then the CTD would have to report that due to reservations on a number of activities the 2003 TA Plan could not be adopted at that meeting.","WTCOMTDM43.pdf","European, Communities, CTE, Members, CTE, General, Council, Director-General, Members, Members, Committee, SPS, TBT, India, Costa, Rica, Members, Members, Director-General, Members, CTD"

His delegation had stated at the previous meeting that it was willing to accept the draft 2003 TA Plan with a number of conditions regarding the long term planning of TA/CB activities. If activities were removed from the draft 2003 TA Plan, then his delegation would have to consult with his Government again before taking any decision.","WTCOMTDM43.pdf","Switzerland"
"4518",4518,"105","105.     The representative of India said that at the first meeting of the CTD held after the draft 2003 TA Plan in October, (WT/COMTD/W/104/Add.1) his delegation had expressed its reservations with respect to the outreach activities. It was therefore not correct to say that his delegation was expressing its reservations at the last minute. In addition, the Secretariat had still not provided information on the contact point in India as his delegation had requested. It was therefore impossible for his delegation to check with the people concerned. He suggested that, if the donor community were interested in the outreach activities, that list could be removed from the TA Plan and put somewhere else, and that a different window be opened for financing such activities. However, he needed to check with his                                                                                    WT/COMTD/M/43                                                                                           Page 35 Government if it could accept the two documents (WT/COMTD/W/104/Rev.1                               and WT/COMTD/W/104/Add.1) and he needed information on the contact points in India.","WTCOMTDM43.pdf","India, CTD, Secretariat, India, India"
"4519",4519,"106","106.    Mr. Osakwe, Director, Technical Cooperation Division said that, with respect to the two regional workshops which were to be held in India, the first one which was a regional workshop for Asian Parliamentarians was being organised in collaboration with the Commonwealth Secretariat and that the WTO Secretariat would get the information on the contact point for India from the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association who was involved in the organization of the activity and would transmit it to the delegation of India in Geneva. For the second workshop on the ""Doha Development Agenda Issues at Stake for Asian Civil Society"" for which India was the venue he said that he had attempted to get that information from the Secretariat person dealing with that issue but that that person had not been available. However, he said that that information would be made available to the delegation of India on that same day. He said that the question that had been raised by the representative of Mexico was pertinent to Members' consideration on the trade and environment symposium. The WTO Ambassador of Egypt, supported by the delegation of Brazil, had in 1999 proposed that the Secretariat organise a high level symposium on trade and development prior to the Seattle Ministerial Conference. In the discussion that took place in the General Council a group of members had recommended a complimentary high level symposium on trade and environment. The terms of both those symposia had been discussed in the General Council and the conclusion had been that the General Council would give the Director-General complete discretion, within certain guidelines, to organise those two high level symposia. That was the origin of the trade and environment symposia that had been held since 1999. It would be unusual for the CTD to restart discussions on what had been concluded in 1999 by the Membership.","WTCOMTDM43.pdf","Osakwe, Director, Technical, Cooperation, Division, India, Commonwealth, Secretariat, WTO, Secretariat, India, Commonwealth, Parliamentary, Association, India, Geneva, India, Secretariat, India, Mexico, Members, WTO, Ambassador, Egypt, Brazil, Secretariat, Seattle, Ministerial, Conference, General, Council, General, Council, General, Council, Director-General, CTD"

The representative of the European Communities said that he had to apologize to the representative of India who was correct in saying that his delegation had raised concerns about financing the outreach activities from the TA budget at a previous meeting of the CTD. However, he said that there were many issues in the draft 2003 TA Plan which his delegation had been concerned about, but which it had been able to overcome and that he therefore hoped that the delegation of India would be able to overcome its reservations as well so that Members could move forward. With respect to the proposal to put the trade and environment symposium before the CTE for consideration, he said that although that could be done it was risky to leave that decision to the CTE because the CTE had difficulty taking any decisions given how difficult the issues were regarded.

The representative of Canada said that she had attended the last trade and environment symposium and recalled that the list of invited NGOs had been circulated to delegations so that any NGO to which Members objected could be removed. That symposium had just as much to do with development as with environment. The symposium suggested was actually a trade and ""sustainable development"" symposium which included a wide range of discussions on development issues and if any WTO body should review the issue it should be the CTD. The issue should not be put to the CTE as that would delay the process. Members could resolve the issue in the CTD.","WTCOMTDM43.pdf","Canada, Members, WTO, CTD, CTE, Members, CTD"

The representative of the European Communities said that it seemed that the problem of the symposium went beyond both the CTE and CTD and Members had benefited from a decision being taken Director-General in 1999. If Members could not agree then they would have to turn to the Director-General. His delegation would deplore that as it would mean a delay in the delivery of 2003 TA. The question was not whether the symposium would be held or not but rather whether it would be financed under a separate financing mechanism. However, he said that it was impossible for his delegation to refer every WTO activity to its financial authorities. His delegation had therefore been pleased when the decision to stop separate funds had been made in 2001.

Legitimate concerns that had been expressed, particularly by the representative of China, with respect to the NGOs that would benefit from the symposium. The response to that was that Members would get a chance to consider the list of invitees for that seminar.

It would be necessary, at a later stage, to fine tune the modalities of the symposium. The suggestion of leaving the issue open after the agreement that had been reached in 1999 meant that the issue would be up for discussion again. If some of the activities were going to be removed from the Plan then his delegation would need more time to think about how to resolve the issue.

"4558",4558,"141","141.     The representative of India said that the representative of the European Communities was correct in saying that the difficulties could not easily be dealt with. Nevertheless, his delegation did not consider the trade and environment symposium to be a TA activity that would benefit negotiators and could not accept it as part of the 2003 TA Plan. He said that the point made by the representative of Norway that the process was meant to be demand-driven was useful. He did not see how the trade and environment symposium could be regarded as a demand-driven activity or how it would increase the capacity of negotiators. He reiterated that if that activity were to be financed form another ""window"", then his delegation would support it.","WTCOMTDM43.pdf","India, Norway"

He asked the representative of India what he meant by ""another window"". His delegation believed the 2003 TA Plan could be renamed ""Technical Assistance and Capacity Building Plan"" and some changes might be made in order to classify the symposium as capacity building. His delegation still believed that negotiators did benefit from that type of activity by being confronted by some of the views of NGOs which from his experience could be forceful. However, Members currently needed to consider the technicalities of the situation.","WTCOMTDM43.pdf","European, Communities, Secretariat, India, Members"

The CTD would not be able to submit the 2003 TA Plan for consideration by the Budget Committee the following day in view of that WT/COMTD/M/43 Page 40 difficulty.

He therefore wished to provide the Committee with a summary of what emerged from those consultation. He began by outlining the decisions reached during those consultations for the Committee to consider. As delegations would recall, the problem emerged with regard to the ""Outreach activities"" on pages 28-29 of document WT/COMTD/W/104/Add.1/Rev.1. The suggested solution that emerged from the consultations was that the ""Outreach"" Section on pages 28 and 29 be deleted and that the products/activities listed on those pages be dealt with in accordance with the following procedures:","WTCOMTDM43.pdf","Chairman, Committee, Committee"
"4565",4565,"148","148.     That was the solution which emerged from the consultations on the section on ""Outreach activities"". Some concerns had also been expressed with respect to paragraphs 37 and 38 in Section X                                                                                  WT/COMTD/M/43                                                                                         Page 41 (A) on page 16 of document WT/COMTD/W/104/Rev.1. The suggestion emerging from the consultations was to delete the last sentence in paragraph 37 which began by: ""The NEPAD is designed…"". Secondly, it was proposed that the wording of the second sentence in paragraph 38 be changed to read: ""However, the WTO is exploring ways of cooperating with the NEPAD in the future."" Delegations might recall that the delegation of Kenya and others had had some concerns and that proposed wording was intended to take care of those concerns. It did not stop the WTO from cooperating with the NEPAD in the future. That would be explored. Finally, it was proposed that when the Committee take action on the 2003 TA Plan, ""The Secretariat committed itself to:         -       provide detailed information on activities carried out in 2002 before the end of                 February 2003,         -       provide a full evaluation of the activities carried out in 2002, by March 2003,         -       produce quarterly reports on activities during 2003,         -       produce a structured plan on how to increase outsourcing to other multilateral                 institutions,         -       review, together with Members, the underlying terms of reference of the Global Trust                 Fund, including issues of access to the Fund and its management,         -       circulate an information note on the Trade Clinics and further consult with Members                 on their modalities, and         -       accommodate the suggestion for small island countries in the Pacific to be considered                 as countries from a region constituting a special challenge.","WTCOMTDM43.pdf","WTO, Kenya, WTO, Committee, Secretariat, Members, Members, Pacific"

Furthermore, based on the evaluation of the 2002 Plan in the CTD, and the performance of the initial phase of the 2003 Plan, Members might wish to review the remaining portion of the 2003 Plan. That would be once the evaluation of the implementation of the 2002 Plan was available and Members had a rough idea of the performance of the initial phase of the 2003 Plan. I believed that, with those changes, Members should be in a position to take action on the Plan. I therefore asked if the Committee could authorize the Secretariat to proceed to implement the 2003 TA Plan as presented in documents WT/COMTD/W/104/Rev.1 and WT/COMTD/W/104/Add.1/Rev.1, with the suggested changes and the commitments from the Secretariat, while the Committee would keep its implementation under review. He also asked if the Committee could agree to refer the 2003 TA Plan to the Budget Committee, with those changes for the Budget Committee to make a recommendation to the General Council on a target amount for the Doha Development Agenda Global Trust Fund in 2003.","WTCOMTDM43.pdf","CTD, Members, Members, Members, Committee, Secretariat, Secretariat, Committee, Committee, Budget, Committee, Budget, Committee, General, Council, Doha, Development, Agenda, Global, Trust, Fund"
"4567",4567,"15","15.     He repeated that WTO TA frequently was judged exclusively by the Annual TA Plans. This was not the totality of WTO TA. There were several key components to a WTO TA plan. One key part was the Joint Integrated Technical Assistance Programme to Selected Least-Developed and Other African Countries (JITAP). The JITAP, which principally was directed towards eight African countries, was in its second phase. There had been requests for the extension of the JITAP and a review of it had been undertaken. He said that the Common Trust Fund – Steering Group (CTF-SG) and the Management Committee had been pleased with the results of the review regarding the implementation of the JITAP as well as the recommendations that had been made for its extension. A possible extension of JITAP to an additional eight African countries was under consideration. The JITAP was a key part of the Secretariat's strategic partnerships with other organisations. He said that another key component to the WTO TA plan was the Integrated Framework (IF) for LDCs. The IF Working Group had been extended from the six-agencies involved to also now include two LDCs' representatives, two donor community representatives as well as the representative of the WT/COMTD/M/43 Page 4 Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD).                      On 3 May 2002, an ""Understanding"" had been reached between the WTO and the regional development banks (RDBs). Cooperation with the RDBs was another component of the WTO Technical Assistance Plan. He expected the Secretariat to shortly be in a position to report on the results of a meeting that had been held with the RDBs on 30 October 2002. At that meeting, an eight point understanding had been reached that would not only help build on the synergies that had been created between the WTO and those RDBs, but which also would enable the WTO achieve significant cost savings to the benefit of the donors. Another component of the WTO TA Plan was the cooperation between the WTO and the Regional Economic Commissions. A meeting had been held with the Regional Economic Commissions at which an agreement had been reached. The Secretariat would shortly report on that and circulate the eight point understanding reached. With respect to the several Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) between the WTO and various organizations, he said that he wished to mention that an MOU was under negotiation with the ACP. On 9 September 2002, the Director-General Dr. Supachai had met with the Mr. Goulongana, the Secretary General of the ACP and both had committed themselves to a Cooperation MOU between the WTO and the ACP. The Secretariat were in the process of working out the details of that MOU. Discussions were also under way with regard to a possible MOU with the World Customs Organisation (WCO) either. This was work in progress. There was thus a large number of MOUs in the making, even if all of them had not yet been put on paper. The Secretariat would shortly be reporting on progress in that respect, as part of the architecture of WTO Technical Cooperation. Finally, managing the never ending requests and match them with the supply was what the Secretariat continuously attempted to do. A joint WTO/OECD database was under development to address several of these issues, including estimating progress that is being made in the implementation of the Doha technical cooperation and capacity building commitments. The database had been finalized and would be available as of 28 November 2002. There would be a report on that Database to the December 2002 meeting of the WTO General Council under the same item as the Director-General would be reporting on his mandate under Paragraph 41 of the Doha Ministerial Declaration. Members should thus judge the implementation of WTO's technical assistance and capacity building (TA/CB) mandate and the adequacy of the implementation on the entire TA architecture.","WTCOMTDM43.pdf","WTO, WTO, WTO, Joint, Integrated, Technical, Assistance, Programme, Management, Committee, JITAP, Secretariat, WTO, IF, Working, Group, LDCs, Organisation, for, Economic, Cooperation, and, Development, OECD, WTO, WTO, Secretariat, WTO, WTO, WTO, WTO, Regional, Economic, Commissions, Secretariat, MOU, WTO, MOU, ACP, Director-General, Supachai, Goulongana, ACP, MOU, WTO, ACP, Secretariat, MOU, MOU, World, Customs, Organisation, WCO, Secretariat, WTO, Technical, Cooperation, Secretariat, Doha, WTO, General, Council, Director-General, Members, WTO"

However, the rate of implementation was calculated based on 383 activities. The reason for that was that nine activities were not activities to be delivered to Members per se. They were activities authorized to developed tools in the area of trade negotiations and other areas. Another 122 activities had been cancelled. The reasons for cancellation would be provided.        One hundred and twenty-nine (129) planned regional activities had been implemented which constituted 75 per cent of the planned regional activities.

One hundred and nineteen (119) such activities had been carried out. The situation with ad hoc activities was undesirable, but it had to be put into perspective. The Secretariat had made suggestions in the revised TA plan of what had to be done to improve the situation. By the end of October 2002, a total of 404 activities had been implemented, combining 285 planned activities with 199 unplanned activities.","WTCOMTDM43.pdf","Osakwe, Members, Members, Secretariat, TA"

In connection with the discussion of how the CTD handled notifications and its relationship to the process in the CRTA, she said that her delegation believed that agreements notified to the CTD under the Enabling Clause provided an important opportunity to improve transparency by referring them to the CRTA for review. While the issue was not on the regular agenda for the 43rd Session of the CTD, her delegation requested the Committee to consider adding such an item to the agenda for the following meeting of the CTD to consider positive steps that the CTD could take to improve notifications of RTAs and their referral to the CRTA for review.

"4589",4589,"17","17.     Mr. Osakwe provided the reasons for the cancellation of 22 activities. First, the recipient countries had cancelled activities for a variety of reasons. Despite repeated attempts by the Secretariat to contact some of the recipients, the Secretariat had not been able to secure a feed-back that would enable the Secretariat to go ahead with the implementation of the activity. For example the absorptive capacity was limited in certain countries and the date, the time, the venue, and complementary national arrangements etc. had not been agreed. Second, some activities were carried out jointly with other agencies and were not under the exclusive control of the WTO. Joint or coordinated delivery between the WTO and other organizations sometimes complicated the delivery when the other organization was not ready to implement the activity. Yet in other cases, there had been cancellations because there had not been enough progress in related areas to justify delivery. For                                                                                        WT/COMTD/M/43                                                                                                Page 5 instance, in the area of accessions it had not be feasible to carry out the activity if the working party had not met or if the consultations by the Chairman of a Working Party had not been fruitful. For some activities, and particularly for the enhancement of trade negotiations skills, the WTO Secretariat had to wait for tools to be developed before it could deliver. Most of the activities related to trade negotiations skills would be delivered in the last two months of 2002. In addition, certain activities had not been delivered when there was risk to life and security of Secretariat staff and participants. This was so particularly under unstable domestic conditions. He further said that the Secretariat needed the help of the Membership in order to reduce the number of ad-hoc activities. There was an opportunity cost in that if the Secretariat carried out more ad-hoc activities it had to reduce the delivery of planned activities and vice versa. The Secretariat capacity to deliver in terms of number of staff had only been boosted late in the year. The Secretariat had assumed that he would have had the 19 L-posts on 1 January 2002. That had not been the case because of a variety of reasons including late remittances of pledged contributions. The result was that by the end of October 2002, 98 planned activities had not been delivered. The Secretariat was confident that it would be able to deliver 60 per cent of those outstanding activities before the end of the year. The outstanding 40 per cent would be dealt with by including some of them in the planned activities for 2003. In some cases, the roll-over had been requested by Members when activities had been scheduled during the holy Ramadan period. Further, some planned activities had been replaced by ad-hoc activities. The advantages of having annual TA plans were that such plans were flexible and could easily be changed to enhance quality. Annual Plans were also easer to evaluate and the volume of activities could be controlled. Five hundred and fourteen (514) activities had been planned for 2002. This mistake would not be repeated in the planning for 2003 when only 443 activities had been planned, but with an increase in value and efficiency. Figures would be adjusted as implementation evolved.","WTCOMTDM43.pdf","Osakwe, Secretariat, Secretariat, Secretariat, WTO, WTO, Chairman, Working, Party, WTO, Secretariat, Secretariat, Secretariat, Secretariat, Secretariat, Secretariat, Secretariat, Members"

At the request of some delegations, the item was kept on the agenda for the October 2002 meeting of the CTD at which the Committee had taken note of the notification. The Secretariat had, at that meeting, also clarified the procedures for notifying RTAs under the Enabling Clause.

However, only six weeks remained in 2002 and according to internal Secretariat procedures, nine weeks were needed to prepare for every activity. That meant that the Secretariat again would start late with the delivery of the coming year's activities. The slippage would not only affect the distribution of activities over the year, in light of the fact that a WTO Ministerial Conference would be held in 2003, but also the implementation rate for 2003.","WTCOMTDM43.pdf","Secretariat, Secretariat, Secretariat, WTO"
"4595",4595,"19","19.      Mr. Osakwe explained the revisions that had been made to the draft 2003 TA Plan, contained in documents WT/COMTD/W/104/Rev.1 and Add.1/Rev.1. The first revision related to strategic partnerships between the WTO and other agencies. Members had been keen on a strategic partnership between the WTO and UNCTAD. That partnership already existed. The WTO Director-General had convened a meeting with UNCTAD Secretary-General Mr. Ricupero and ITC Executive Director Mr. Bélisle on 30 October 2002 at which they had recommitted themselves to that partnership. This Partnership had been reflected in paragraph 46 (b) of document WT/COMTD/W/104/Rev.1. Paragraph 46(a) of that same revision referred to the strategic partnership with the agencies involved in the Integrated Framework. The WTO Director-General would be chairing the Third Meeting of the Integrated Framework Heads of Agencies that Mr. Koehler, IMF Managing Director, had agreed to host.      The regional trade policy courses held in Africa had been included in WT/COMTD/W/104/Add.1/Rev.1. These Regional Trade Policy Courses was a key part of the revision which had been made possible by the positive evaluation of those courses by Mr. Paul Rolian, Technical Cooperation Audit. There was a focus on the least-developed countries in the draft 2003 TA Plan. At the last meeting of the Sub-Committee on Least-Developed Countries, the representative of Zambia, on behalf of the LDCs, had made an encouraging statement saying that the draft 2003 TA Plan was in the right direction. The LDCs' Consultative Group had also made a number of suggestions that the Secretariat would be able to take into account when implementing the 2003 TA Plan. There had been a request for the inclusion of a special module on special and differential treatment (S&D) in the WTO training activities. Such a module had been included and WT/COMTD/M/43 Page 6 would figure in all WTO training activities. He further said that it was necessary to deal with the large amount of ad-hoc activities. The ad-hoc activities had decreased from constituting almost 100 per cent of WTO activities when the 3-Year Plans were in place (and there were no real plans) to 29 per cent in 2002. WTO senior management had supported that ad-hoc activities should not exceed 5 per cent of planned activities in 2003. However, there was still some flexibility as beneficiary countries could always substitute activities. Substituted activities would not be considered as an ad- hoc activity. Criteria for ad-hoc activities had been approved by the senior management and were included in paragraph 17 of document WT/COMTD/W/104/Rev.1. The Secretariat would thus be in a position to take account of unforeseen negotiation dynamics. Ad-hoc activities might also arise in the application of trade clinics but would still not exceed 5 per cent of planned activities in 2003. In addition to the revisions mentioned, he said that there were several editorial revisions to the draft 2003 TA Plan.","WTCOMTDM43.pdf","Osakwe, WTO, Members, WTO, UNCTAD, WTO, Director-General, UNCTAD, Ricupero, ITC, Director, Bélisle, Integrated, Framework, WTO, Director-General, Integrated, Framework, Heads, of, Agencies, Koehler, IMF, Director, Africa, Paul, Rolian, Technical, Cooperation, Audit, Zambia, LDCs, LDCs, ', Consultative, Group, Secretariat, WTO, WTO, WTO, WTO, Secretariat"

The representative of the United States said that her delegation wished to add, under ""Other Business"" an item relating to reporting on the Regional Trade Agreement (RTA) between India and WT/COMTD/M/43 Page 2 Sri Lanka. She said that her delegation wished that that Agreement also be reported to the Committee on Regional Trade Agreements (CRTA). 2.       A new Addendum would 2 be created, entitled ""Outreach activities"". The remaining activities (the first seven listed on Page 28) would be moved to that new Addendum 2. That new Addendum would have the following three footnotes:         (a)    There would be a footnote relating only to the Trade and Environment Symposium,                (the first activity in the new Addendum 2 on ""Outreach Activities"") stating that: ""The                Secretariat will consult with the Committee on Trade and Environment and the                Committee on Trade and Development on modalities, agenda, and participation in                respect of this symposium"".         (b)    The second footnote would relate to the following six regional activities (the six                regional activities in Addendum 2). That footnote would state that: ""The Secretariat                will consult with the members and the organizations involved and the CTD                Chairperson on these activities"".         (c)    That there would be a third footnote relating to the entire Addendum 2 stating that:                ""Within the context of a full review of technical assistance and capacity building, a                decision will be taken on the inclusion of such regional activities in technical                assistance and capacity building for subsequent years."" 2.      The latter issue falls into the competence of TCA. Members will recall that since the beginning of 2002 a new system of evaluation of TA activities has been in place (it was adopted at the end of March 2002). Because of the great number of activities to be evaluated, heavy reliance has been placed on a system of combining internal evaluations by TCA with self evaluation by TA providers in order to ensure maximum coverage of TA activities. This arrangement provides for a comprehensive coverage of all WTO TA activities. Both types of evaluation rely heavily on feedback from the beneficiaries. Based on the analysis of these evaluations, Techncial Cooperation Audit (TCA) can provide immediate feedback to the resource persons/secretariat division(s) concerned.","WTCOMTDM43.pdf","United, States, RTA, India, Sri, Lanka, Committee, CRTA, Secretariat, Committee, on, Trade, and, Environment, Committee, on, Trade, and, Development, Secretariat, CTD, Chairperson, TCA, Members, TCA, WTO, Techncial, Cooperation, Audit, TCA"
"4597",4597,"20","20.      Mr. Osakwe further said that a number of revisions had been requested by the delegation of Zambia, on behalf of the LDCs, at the 8 October 2002 meeting. Those editorial revisions had been incorporated. Members had also asked for clarifications and explanations in several areas. First, the clarification of the overall structure and strategic partnerships had already been provided. There had also been questions regarding negotiation-focused activities. The Secretariat had been able to develop several software tools, principally thanks to the Department for International Development of the United Kingdom which had provided additional resources. The Secretariat had organized a meeting on 18 October 2002 to which UNCTAD and the OECD had been invited to present their programmes and tools to enhance trade negotiations skills. The WTO Secretariat had also developed tools and would be organizing more trade negotiation skills seminars. Trade negotiations were also a key part of the activities of the WTO Training Institute. These trade negotiation skill activities would be organized in cooperation with ITC, UNCTAD, OECD and the World Bank since those agencies had also developed complementary tools. Eight regional training courses for senior government officials on the Doha Development Agenda would be organized. The Secretariat had been asked about its outsourcing initiatives. Some activities had been outsourced to the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) based on a cooperation agreement. The WTO Secretariat was in the process of dialogue with the International Development Law Institute (IDLI), which was an intergovernmental agency with solid experience in the area of training-of-trainers. The Secretariat was further exploring outsourcing possibilities and would be reporting accordingly. The Secretariat applied strict criteria when outsourcing. First, outsourcing was sought for cost-efficiency reasons. Second, the WTO would only outsource to organizations which did not engage in advocacy as the WTO Secretariat had been mandated by Members to maintain the full integrity of their collective positions.","WTCOMTDM43.pdf","Osakwe, Zambia, Members, Secretariat, Department, for, International, Development, United, Kingdom, Secretariat, UNCTAD, OECD, WTO, Secretariat, WTO, Training, Institute, ITC, OECD, World, Bank, Doha, Development, Agenda, Secretariat, World, Intellectual, Property, Organization, WIPO, WTO, Secretariat, International, Development, Law, Institute, Secretariat, Secretariat, WTO, WTO, Secretariat, Members"
"4598",4598,"21","21.     The Secretariat had also been asked to clarify how it assessed TA needs. Mr. Osakwe said that needs were primarily assessed through the TA requests from the beneficiary countries. However, they were also assessed through the Trade Policy Reviews, the back-to-office reports written by WTO professional staff, the diagnostic trade integration studies from the Integrated Framework, and the Geneva Weeks for non-resident missions. Another area which the Secretariat had been asked to clarify was its capacity to deliver TA. The Secretariat capacity to deliver TA had never really been measured. Proper counting of activities delivered in a year was begun in 2002. Four hundred and four (404) activities had been delivered by the end of October 2002 even though the 19 L-positions had not been activated until the summer of 2002. He said that he estimated that by the end of 2002 about 450 activities would have been delivered. Using 2002 as a base-year, and not withstanding the pressure of the Ministerial Conference in 2003, he estimated the Secretariat executing capacity to be between 400 and 450 activities per year.","WTCOMTDM43.pdf","Secretariat, Osakwe, Trade, Policy, Reviews, WTO, Integrated, Framework, Secretariat, Secretariat, Secretariat"
"4599",4599,"22","22.     Mr. Osakwe responded to questions that had been posed on trade clinics. The Secretariat was in the process of preparing an internal Secretariat note which would provide guidelines for the application of trade clinics. When that had been done and had been approved by the senior management, Members would be informed. An illustrative example of how Trade Clinics would aply was evident in the case of Sierra Leone. The Trade Minister of Sierra Leone had written to the WTO                                                                                    WT/COMTD/M/43                                                                                            Page 7 Director-General to inform him that Sierra Leone had just emerged from a destructive civil war and that no trade policy infrastructure was in place. Sierra Leone was a non-resident, least-developed country and wanted the WTO to assist it in the formulation of trade policy, provide a WTO reference centre and assist its integration into the multilateral trading system. The Government of Sierra Leone had not been in a position to respond to the WTO letter regarding its TA needs. WTO senior management was of the view that Sierra Leone was a perfect case for a trade clinic.","WTCOMTDM43.pdf","Osakwe, Secretariat, Secretariat, Members, Sierra, Leone, Sierra, Leone, WTO, Director-General, Sierra, Leone, Sierra, Leone, WTO, WTO, Sierra, Leone, WTO, WTO, Sierra, Leone"
"4600",4600,"23","23.     Finally. questions had been asked regarding the delivery of TA under the pressure of the Fifth Ministerial Conference. Mr. Osakwe responded that the Secretariat would distribute work and time the activities as efficiently as possible. However, if the adoption of the 2003 TA Plan was further delayed, the situation would become more complicated. He said that he would not comment on the issues raised with respect to quality and effectiveness as Mr. Paul Rolian, Dierctor of the Technical Cooperation Audit would respond.","WTCOMTDM43.pdf","Osakwe, Secretariat, Paul, Rolian, Dierctor, Technical, Cooperation, Audit"
"4601",4601,"24","24.      Mr. Paul Rolian, Director, Technical Cooperation Audit, said that Members had before document WT/COMTD/W/107 containing the evaluation of the regional trade policy courses that had been held in Casablanca and Nairobi earlier in 2002, for French-speaking and English-speaking African countries, respectively. Despite the Secretariat's best efforts to get the report to Members quickly after the conclusion of the courses at the beginning of October 2002, it had come out relatively late in relation to the meeting of the CTD, in particular the translations into French and Spanish, and he asked for Members' indulgence on that point. In any case, the message of his report was a rather simple one. He said that, before getting into the subject of the paper, it was worth stressing that the report dealt exclusively with the African Trade Policy Courses. The general annual evaluation report on WTO’s TA activities would be prepared in the first part of 2003, in accordance with the Secretariat's commitment to Members.                  The report contained in document WT/COMTD/W/107 was not a feasibility study on future Regional Trade Policy Courses either. That was a matter on which Members would have to pronounce, in the light of experience with the first two courses. Nevertheless, there were elements in this report that Members might wish to take into account. The starting point for the evaluation, like any evaluations, was the objectives which the courses had been intended to achieve. The efficiency, effectiveness, relevance and sustainability of the courses were examined, and some conclusions and lessons learned were drawn from the experience. The objectives were framed in the context of the undertakings in the Doha Development Agenda, and bearing in mind the need to provide supplementary capacity-building activities for developing and LDCs in the build-up to the Fifth Ministerial meeting, that was to go beyond “business as usual”. There were three objectives for the courses. First, they constituted a means of increasing the number of government officials who could benefit from the long trade policy courses that had traditionally been run in Geneva. Second, they were intended to give a distinct regional focus to the standard Trade Policy Course mode. Third, and perhaps the most ambitious objective, was that the courses were to initiate a process of institutional capacity-building in the African region through partnership arrangements with academic institutions and regional resource persons to whom, over time, ownership of and responsibility for the capacity building instrument would be transferred.","WTCOMTDM43.pdf","Paul, Rolian, Director, Technical, Cooperation, Audit, Members, Casablanca, Nairobi, Secretariat, Members, CTD, Members, WTO, Secretariat, Members, Members, Members, Doha, Development, Agenda, LDCs, Geneva"
"4602",4602,"25","25.      He went on to say that he would concentrate his remarks on the three main conclusions that could be drawn from the experience. First, and most importantly, the courses had done what they were set out to do. Fifty officials (27 in Casablanca and 23 in Nairobi) had been given the opportunity to attend a long trade policy course, which they would not have been able to do at all, or would have had to wait for as opportunities arose in Geneva. There was a clear regional focus, a focus that cannot delivered during the Geneva-based courses because the participants in the Geneva- based courses were from more than one region. The regional focus had been assured in two ways. First, the subjects covered had been illustrated by references to the regional context to the greatest extent possible. Second, regional resource persons had been associated in the delivery of the courses, albeit in different ways in Casablanca and Nairobi. In Nairobi the teaching assignments had been WT/COMTD/M/43 Page 8 most often shared between a WTO resource person and a regional resource person, whereas in Casablanca, there had been no shared teaching, but rather individual modules delivered by local experts. The first two objectives had therefore been entirely achieved. It was clear from the feedback that the participants had significantly enhanced their knowledge and skills, in the same way as they would have, had they been able to attend a Geneva-based trade policy course. The replication of the Geneva courses, which was the basic blueprint for the African courses, had worked. In addition, participants had been able to concentrate on questions on which they had shared concerns, or which were of particular relevance to them. The consolidation of those gains would of course depend, as for all TA activities, on the participants being and remaining in functions related to the Multilateral Trading System. As for the third objective, the creation of an institutional base in the region for taking over responsibility for the courses, a promising beginning had been made, particularly in Nairobi, but that was by definition an issue on which more experience would be needed before it was possible to say that the objective had been fully met. What could be said was that in Nairobi, the foundation for future regionally based capacity to run the courses and ownership of them had been laid through the shared teaching arrangements and a real training of trainers. That was not as evident from the experience in the French-speaking course.","WTCOMTDM43.pdf","Casablanca, Nairobi, Geneva, Geneva, Casablanca, Nairobi, Nairobi, WTO, Casablanca, Nairobi, Nairobi"
"4603",4603,"26","26.      He further said that, after the substance of the courses, another important issue on which the Members would no doubt wish to focus was the cost, in both absolute and relative terms. When the courses were launched, there had been some alarming estimates that the courses would cost far more than those held in Geneva. However, having been budgeted at over one million Swiss francs each, they had been brought in at less. The other piece of good news was that based on an analysis of the Nairobi experience (the Casablanca figures were in the process of being analysed but were not expected to produce very different results), it could be said that the courses were about as expensive, per participant and per day, as the courses in Geneva. However, there were elements that cause difficulty in the comparison, but the Technical Cooperation Audit had done its best to compare like with like. On that basis the regional courses come out with a slight cost advantage overall. Both the regional and the Geneva courses cost considerably less than many other TA/CB activities carried out by the WTO Secretariat. The third issue that had emerged as being particularly critical in the conduct of the courses were the implications for the Secretariat in terms of human resources, and more generally the circumstances surrounding the planning, design and execution of the courses. The courses were add-ons to an already heavy programme of work in the Training Institute, which had been assigned principal responsibility, as well as in operational divisions that provided resource persons. The time frame for getting the courses up and running was perilously tight, and as a result, there had been a good deal of precipitation. There had been no time to assess adequately the human resource implications, much less to do anything about them. Those implications must be taken into account, whatever unit was assigned responsibility, especially since the courses were run far away from the Geneva base, which inevitably engendered additional problems. The courses had a large budget (in this case over CHF 2 million). They were thus not negligible projects in financial terms, nor in terms of the inroads they made on the Secretariat’s capacity to deliver TA with the usual quality. Of course, over time, if those courses work out as we expect in relation to the third objective, local institutional capacity and ownership, then it could be expected that the input from the WTO Secretariat would be a diminishing one.","WTCOMTDM43.pdf","Members, Geneva, Nairobi, Geneva, Technical, Cooperation, Audit, Geneva, WTO, Secretariat, Secretariat, Training, Institute, Geneva, Secretariat, WTO, Secretariat"
"4604",4604,"27","27.      He further said that the paper highlighted a number of practical issues that arose, some of which were linked to the nature of the exercise itself, whatever the venue, and some of which were specific to the venues selected. That was incidentally a point to which attention was drawn, namely the need to select venues on the basis of a clear indication of commitment, a clear list of specifications, and to make a thorough analysis of the real potential of a candidate venue to host a course. In the present case, if more time had been available, that would have allowed more analysis, which in turn might have permitted identification of some of the problems that later emerged. He said that the report concluded by drawing attention to a number of issues that were likely to be central to any discussion on the future of such regional courses. Those include costs, but also the place of the courses in the overall portfolio of WTO TA/CB activities, the trade-offs that might have to be made,                                                                                    WT/COMTD/M/43                                                                                            Page 9 the implications for staff resources and resource allocation, and the number, frequency, and geographical spread of the programme. For its part, and bearing those conclusions in mind, the Secretariat had decided to propose the continuation of the courses in Africa as part of the draft 2003 TA Plan, as had already been stated.","WTCOMTDM43.pdf","WTO, Secretariat, Africa"
"4605",4605,"28","28.      Deputy Director-General, Mr. Abbott said that the estimated cost for the revised draft 2003 TA Plan was lower than that for the initial draft 2003 TA Plan. However, the volume of activities was broadly the same as in 2002. As indicated at the previous meeting, the results of the discussions in the CTD would be taken into consideration by the Committee on Budget, Finance and Administration (Budget Committee) later in 2002 when it was to make a recommendation to the General Council for the target amount for the DDA Global Trust Fund for 2003. The figures that he would present would be adjusted, as necessary, to reflect the results of Members' discussions and he would report back to the     Budget    Committee       accordingly.        Members      had    before     them     document WT/COMTD/W/104/Rev.1, its Addendum WT/COMTD/W/104/Add.1/Rev.1, and document WT/COMTD/W/103 relating to training. Members had also received document CRP(02)/4 which provided some of the basic figures he was to present. The activities had been grouped into three categories: the Geneva-based activities, the regional activities, and the national activities. Geneva- based activities were held at the WTO headquarters and could involve either Geneva-based delegates, as was most often the case or a mixture of Geneva-based and capital-based delegates, as well as some outside speakers. Regional activities were activities which involved several WTO Members or Observers and for which participants’ travelling and subsistence costs had to be financed. National activities were events for one Member for which the WTO financed the travel cost of WTO staff members to go and service such an event. The good news, compared to the figures he had presented at a previous meeting, was that the costing for all the draft 2003 TA Plan was approximately CHF 21.5 million. The total was in actual fact higher and estimated at CHF 28.5 million. However, the figure of CHF 28.5 million had been reduced by CHF 7 million because the Secretariat expected to be able to share costs in a number of cases with partners, so the net total for the technical cooperation activities was that CHF 21.5 million. The figure had been arrived at using standard methodologies, calculating a standard cost per person and day, multiplied by the number of days etc. The figures were therefore average figures.","WTCOMTDM43.pdf","Director-General, Abbott, CTD, Committee, on, Budget, ,, Finance, and, Administration, -LRB-, Budget, Committee, General, Council, DDA, Global, Trust, Fund, Members, Budget, Committee, Members, Members, Geneva, WTO, WTO, Members, Member, WTO, WTO, Secretariat"
"4606",4606,"29","29.      He went on to say that a couple of more elements had been added to the figure of CHF 21.5 million. The activities of the WTO Training Institute were not covered by the regular WTO budget and the small amount of CHF 233,000 therefore had to be added, as had overheads costs of an amount of CHF 2,8 million. The total cost for WTO TA and training then amounted to CHF 24,6 million. However, a number of resources already existed. CHF 1 million was available from the regular budget for TA work. The balance of the Global Trust Fund at the end of 2002 was expected to amount to between CHF 1 and 3 million. That depended on the Secretariat's success in delivering undelivered activities, on whether some of the Members would pay their pledges, and on pledges which had been announced either in March 2002 or more recently for 2003. Those resources amounted to between CHF 7,7 – 9,7 million to be deducted from the figure of CHF 24,6. Taken together, that meant that Members would be asked to pay between CHF 15 and 17 million. That was a substantially lower figure than the one presented at the last meeting. He further described the main elements of the reduction that made. One principal saving came from the fact that financing of capital-based officials participation in Geneva-based activities for the most part had been excluded. The Secretariat had hoped to enhance the participation of capital-based official in activities in Geneva as it was good for institution building. However, it had proved to be an expensive activity. The Secretariat would therefore not pursue it. A second element of the reduction of the total cost was that the Secretariat assumed cost-sharing with its partners such as the regional development banks and UN regional economic commissions. There was reason to believe that they would contribute as they had done so earlier. Some activities had been ""rationalized"" by being cut. For example, only three seminars for the training of trainers were included in the revised draft 2003 Plan instead of the WT/COMTD/M/43 Page 10 originally planned six. On the other hand, the positive evaluation of the first two regional courses in Africa had led the Secretariat to the conclusion that they should be repeated. The revised version of the 2003 TA Plan therefore contained two similar courses costing somewhat over 1 million CHF each. Finally, the Secretariat had decided that all the 19 L posts provided for TA delivery was going to be paid for from the Programme Support Fund. There had been a significant under-spending in 2002 because the Secretariat had not been able to recruit new staff immediately, and some had only began to work in 2002. That had meant that those posts could be financed out of the Programme Support Fund in 2002 and that the Secretariat would be able to do the same for 2003 as well. However, in a year's time Members would have to consider another solution because by then all the available money would have been used and an alternative way of funding would have to be found. The Secretariat would take account of any comments Members might have with respect to the activities in the draft 2003 Plan and any such changes would also be translated into a revised budget estimate which he would then report to the Budget Committee.","WTCOMTDM43.pdf","WTO, Training, Institute, WTO, WTO, Secretariat, Members, Members, Secretariat, Geneva, Secretariat, Secretariat, UN, Africa, Secretariat, Secretariat, Secretariat, Secretariat, Members, Secretariat, Members, Budget, Committee"

The CTD had considered it and taken note of it. He asked what action the delegation of the United States wished the CTD to take. 3.       All evaluations, including those carried out on site by TCA (about 12 a year) serve as input into the annual report which TCA submits to the Committee in the first part of the year (the report on the activities of 2001 was issued on 11 April 2002). This timing allows for consideration of the totality of activities that have taken place in the reference year. TCA will certainly make every effort to respond to the request that the evaluation of 2002 activities reaches Members by the end of March 2003. More frequent reporting of evaluations such as those carried out by TCA is not customary, nor is it likely to be meaningful in respect of the kind of activities carried out by the WTO (large in number and fragmented) , in the absence of a critical mass of information on which to base an analysis.","WTCOMTDM43.pdf","Chairman, RTA, India, Sri, Lanka, Committee, on, Trade, Development, CTD, United, States, CTD, TCA, TCA, Committee, TCA, Members, TCA, WTO"
"4608",4608,"30","30.     The representative of Morocco said that his statement related to the introduction given by Mr. Rolian relating to document WT/COMTD/W/107 which contained the evaluation of the African Trade Policy Courses held in Nairobi and Casablanca. Those courses had been organized with a short term outlook in the context of the post Doha TA/CB to meet the needs of the African continent. That goal had largely been achieved, in spite of the fact that the courses had been considered as a pilot project. In that context it was first important to draw lessons in a self-critical manner in order to allow for an objective analysis. His delegation noted the problems flagged in the report concerning the Trade Policy Course held in Casablanca. His delegation believed that the relatively short time available for the preparation of the course and the inexperience of the ""Institut Supérieur de Commerce et d'Administration des Enterprises (ISCAE)"" in organizing such courses certainly had contributed to the logistical and administrative problems which had been encountered. It was normal that practical implementation problems arose with a pilot project conceived and implemented in a short period of time. That was especially true when, as in the case of the two Africa courses, it was a question of almost complete delocalisation of a course traditionally held in Geneva.","WTCOMTDM43.pdf","Morocco, Rolian, Nairobi, Casablanca, Doha, Casablanca, Institut, Supérieur, de, Commerce, et, d'Administration, des, Enterprises, Africa, Geneva"
"4609",4609,"31","31.      As concerned the imperfections of the Course held in Casablanca, he went on to say that his delegation regretted that the course had not functioned as well as foreseen, at least not in the logistical and administrative respects. Morocco was a major organizer of international events. The success of the Marrakech Ministerial Conference illustrated that. His delegation had been somewhat shocked and saddened to learn about the content of the evaluation report. It had been necessary to look back with a realistic and objective perspective. His delegation had then realized that the responsibility that the Government of Morocco had for the Casablanca Course was one that was shared with the WTO Secretariat. It was shared in the sense that the preparation of the course, the negotiation of the modalities, and the discussions regarding certain arrangements had not followed the normal procedures for the quite simple reason that they had not been managed by the appropriate WTO structures. The Technical Cooperation Division and the Training Institute had not been directly involved in the organization of the Casablanca course. It was a shared responsibility, not necessarily by the appropriate WTO structures but by certain individuals who had managed the Casablanca Course as a personal affair. In the context of the regrettable deficiencies on the part of the ISCAE it had to be recalled that that institute had not been officially selected by his Government. The choice of institute had rather been made on the first floor of the WTO Secretariat. Equally, the MOU had also been drawn up on the first floor of the WTO Secretariat. The problems encountered were, in that sense, foreseeable. His Mission had not been involved in the preparations in order to avoid problems. The involvement of certain Government departments could have avoided the currency exchange problem unfortunately experienced by some participants. However, what was important was to draw lessons from had happened. Nevertheless, his delegation did not believe that the Government of Morocco alone should bare the entire responsibility for the mistakes made in the organization of the Casablanca Course. His delegation had therefore been surprised to notice that the Nairobi course was confirmed for 2003, but that the venue had been left open for French speaking Africa according to page 36 of document WT/COMTD/W/104/Add.1/Rev.1. He asked on which basis the Casablanca                                                                                      WT/COMTD/M/43                                                                                             Page 11 Course had been withdrawn. His delegation had been pleased to hear that Mr. Rolian had mentioned that that the Casablanca Course had met its main objectives. The Government of Morocco was capable of organizing the next course with a firm commitment that the errors of the past would not be repeated in the future, and in the hope that the WTO Secretariat would not repeat the errors it had committed either. His Authorities committed itself to discuss the basic criteria directly with the Heads of the Technical Cooperation Division and the Training Institute in order to agree on the best possible modalities which would ensure the success and continuation of the regional trade policy course for French-speaking Africa in Morocco. However, the Moroccan institution to be selected in full cooperation and coordination with the different ministries in Morocco might be in Rabat and not in Casablanca. He therefore launched an appeal to the WTO Secretariat as well as to his fellow French-speaking African delegations in order to ensure that the regional trade policy course for French-speaking Africa could continue and that the regional basis would be consolidated with Morocco as a basis. However, lessons should be drawn from previous mistakes and efforts should be made in order for this regional trade policy course, in which his Government firmly believed, to become successful. His Government had, even before the launching of last year's regional trade policy course, officially contacted the Technical Cooperation Division in order to organize a third cycle course at the Mohammed V University in Rabat. It was for all those reasons that his Government, if the course were to be confirmed, would not spare any effort to comply with the commitments made by the different departments involved in order to ensure the best possible conditions for the successful implementation of the course.","WTCOMTDM43.pdf","Casablanca, Morocco, Marrakech, Ministerial, Conference, Morocco, Casablanca, Course, WTO, Secretariat, WTO, Technical, Cooperation, Division, Training, Institute, Casablanca, WTO, Casablanca, Course, WTO, Secretariat, MOU, WTO, Secretariat, Morocco, Nairobi, Africa, Rolian, Casablanca, Course, Morocco, WTO, Secretariat, Technical, Cooperation, Division, Training, Institute, Africa, Morocco, Morocco, Rabat, Casablanca, WTO, Secretariat, Africa, Morocco, Mohammed, V, University, Rabat"
"4610",4610,"32","32.      The representative of Switzerland said that he preferred to separate the three topics relating to technical cooperation and first talk about the evaluation of the regional trade policy courses and the draft 2003 TA budget and wait with the more important which was the draft 2003 TA Plan. His delegation had found the evaluation the regional trade policy courses to be a good and interesting document because the Committee's decisions in the future would have to be based on evaluations of present activities. In that connection he said that his delegation had hoped to have at least a preliminary evaluation of the implementation of the 2002 TA Plan for the preparation of the draft 2003 TA Plan. However, the evaluation of the regional trade policy courses in Africa did not contain much about the impact of the two seminars and, in that sense, left the question about the use of different TA tools open. He did not share the optimistic view that the evaluation was positive. What it did indicate was that better preparation was be necessary. More time to prepare was necessary. The funding had to be available before the final plans were made. The choice of partner institution was essential. The intervention by the representative of Morocco was a case in point. There seemed to be some relief in terms of the cost and even higher savings might be possible in the future by delegating more activities to the regions. As far as the future was concerned, he said that the evaluation had not, and could not yet answer the questions of whether more, the same number, or fewer regional trade policy courses were needed and over what time period. Neither did the evaluation contain information regarding the opportunity cost of regional trade policy courses and the relative use of those courses in comparison with other technical cooperation tools. He said that his personal conclusion was that the trend should be to increase the number of regional trade policy courses and decrease the number of workshops and short-term activities. In addition, it was important for delegations to get a clear idea from the Secretariat of the resource implications of the regional trade policy courses and how the human resource problems were going to be solved. What had also become clear from the evaluation of the regional trade policy courses was that the choice of partner institution was essential. There was a suggestion in the report that the choice should be made through and open bidding process. It was important that a decision on a transparent process of selecting partner institutions was made, open to scrutiny by Members. Cooperation with local training institutes should be of long term as the transfer of capacity to the trainers in the region was a gradual process until the WTO could somewhat disengage.

"4611",4611,"33","33.      He went on to say that his first comment with respect to the draft budget related to cost sharing. It was good to have such an important contribution from other institutions as suggested. However, as far as the donors were concerned, it might be a case of double counting, as quite a few of the institutions which might contribute were institutions for which the funds were provided by the same donors. Although it was a reduced cost from a WTO point of view, it might not be a reduction of cost in terms of what single donors had provide. An example was that when some of the regional development banks carried out TA they did it with funds which were provided directly or indirectly provided by donors. In that respect it was important, at least for some of the donors, to get a transparent picture of any cost sharing. His second comment with respect to the draft budget was that of the calculation of overheads. Although it might be a mute point, he said that delegations were used to the overhead calculation of 13 per cent for consulting contracts with international institutions, as a global overhead to a single project. However, considering the WTO TA budget was different. He suggested that, instead of having an overhead of 13 per cent, it would be more helpful to get a real account for the overhead. A real account would show the actual cost for the institution, instead of using a system did not seem to be adapted to the actual budget methods of an institution like WTO.","WTCOMTDM43.pdf","WTO, WTO, WTO"
"4612",4612,"34","34.     Deputy Director-General, Mr. Abbott said that as far as the overheads were concerned he said that he would look into whether they could be accounted for in a different way. Nevertheless, most of the budget involved related to the L posts, as it had been decided that they were to be financed through the overheads. As far is the cost sharing was concerned he said that it might be true that some of WTO's partner institution might use funds from other donors. However, that was nothing the WTO should get involved in. From the WTO perspective, they were contributing to the costs of the WTO and it was therefore a plus for the WTO and the donors and cost-sharing was what Members always asked the Secretariat to do and the Secretariat therefore attempted to do so.","WTCOMTDM43.pdf","Director-General, Abbott, WTO, WTO, WTO, WTO, WTO, Members, Secretariat, Secretariat"
"4613",4613,"35","35.      Mr. Osakwe, Director, Technical Cooperation Division, said that the African Trade Policy Courses constituted a staff burden on the Secretariat staff. What senior management had decided, and which was reflected in the first bullet of paragraph 22 of WT/COMTD/W/104/Add.1, was that those two African Trade Policy Courses would be Secretariat wide activities. The burden of their implementation would not be posed on one division. The implementation of those courses would be directly supervised by the Deputy Director-General Dr. Rana with the assistance of the Technical Cooperation Division and the Training Institute. However, the staff burden would be distributed evenly across the Secretariat staff. Secondly, and related to the proposals that DDG Mr. Abbott had made to the Budget Committee with regard to all WTO Secretariat staffing, was the need to have the 19 L positions renewed as quickly as possible. The second question raised related to the mix of instruments for TA activities. Members had urged the Secretariat early in 2002 to ask Members and Observers to state their needs. The needs identified by Members and Observers were diverse. They did not only relate to three-months courses. Some Members were interested in such courses, whereas others requested five days courses or explicitly insisted on two to three week trade policy courses. As the demands spanned across a wide range of activities and Members had requested the Secretariat to base the activities delivered on the explicit priorities of the Membership, the delivery had to be diverse as well. He finally said that it was up for Members to decide if the future design of activities should be based on evaluation results.","WTCOMTDM43.pdf","Osakwe, Director, Technical, Cooperation, Division, African, Trade, Policy, Courses, Secretariat, Secretariat, Director-General, Rana, Technical, Cooperation, Division, Training, Institute, Secretariat, Abbott, Budget, Committee, WTO, Secretariat, Members, Secretariat, Members, Members, Members, Members, Secretariat, Members"
"4614",4614,"36","36.     The representative of Barbados said that she, at that time, only wished to comment on the Regional Trade Policy Courses. One positive aspect of the trade policy courses held in Nairobi and Casablanca were the important focus on regional issues. Only that type of regional exercise could bring real regional identification and specialization. Another positive aspect was the obvious usefulness of training the trainers which made the development effort sustainable. A third aspect was the positive returns on institutional partnerships and the obvious outcome of strengthened capacity and resources of academic institutions in Members with regard to WTO-related issues. Finally, it was a useful learning exercise for the WTO itself. Lessons from regional trade policy courses could be brought back to Geneva to broaden the perspectives of people working in Geneva. Past experiences should be used for the future. It was also necessary to extend the courses to other regions in 2003.

There were several reasons for that. First, it was widely acknowledged that the Caribbean region was one which faced specific challenges due to smallness and capacity constraints, particular institutional capacity restraints. Second, the region comprised a fairly homogenous pool of beneficiaries which made it easy to target and fashion the course. Third, there was an established university in the region, the University of the West Indies, which had a network of campuses located throughout the countries of the region. Those campuses would be natural partners to a regional trade policy course. Finally, there were several existing regional institutions such as the Caribbean Development Bank, the Caribbean Community Secretariat, within the region which could help in the needs analysis which would have to be undertaken in the formulation of the course modules. The was already a MOU between the WTO and the latter. It was for those reasons that her delegation wished to see the Secretariat give favourable consideration to the extension of the regional trade policy courses to other regions, including the Caribbean. The regional trade policy courses should be maintained as a training tool as it was a useful one.","WTCOMTDM43.pdf","Barbados, Nairobi, Casablanca, Members, WTO, Geneva, Geneva, Caribbean, Community, Caribbean, University, of, the, West, Indies, Caribbean, Development, Bank, Caribbean, Community, Secretariat, MOU, WTO, Secretariat, Caribbean"
"4615",4615,"37","37.     The representative of Kenya said that document WT/COMTD/W/104/Rev.1 reminded Members of the need to integrate TA into national development plans. That document contained other useful information and members needed to go through and familiarise themselves with the points raised in the document. The revised 2003 TA Plan included a second phase of the JITAP programme which was of great importance to Africa. He asked the Secretariat to provide clarification as to what that programme would include. He said that the eight beneficiary countries that had experienced the first phase of the programme had benefited from all the activities in the programme. Each activity played a different role and asking members to choose a few out of the listed activities could pose problems, especially for new beneficiaries entering the programme. He said that his delegation was pleased that NEPAD was included in the draft 2003 TA Plan. He said that the NEPAD went beyond trade and his delegation felt that giving the NEPAD a regional approach such as through regional trading arrangements would have been more appropriate for the WTO than starting at the continental level. He asked the Secretariat to provide more information in that respect. With respect to the report given by Mr. Rolian, he said that his delegation was pleased with the results of the regional trade policy courses held in Nairobi. His delegation did not share the views of the representative of Morocco because the Government of Kenya had been fully involved in the organisation of the course and the selection of the partner institution that had worked together with the WTO Secretariat. Given the constraints faced by the Secretariat, his delegation felt that good work had been done and his Government looked forward to continued cooperation in the future. One of the objectives with the regional courses was institutional capacity building so that the role of the WTO could be reduced as the organisation of those courses progressed. That would ensure that the requisite capacity would be built in those countries to enable them to participate fully in the multilateral trading system. He was therefore pleased that the report contained a recommendation for the continuation of the regional trade policy course in Nairobi and his delegation looked forward to the beginning of the second course. He said that his delegation was pleased that the figures for the 2003 TA budget had been revised from CHF 37,463,415 to CHF 24,611,225 which should also be appreciated by the donors. He suggested adding a column to the 2003 TA Plan containing the cost of each activity so as to give Members an idea of it. His delegation believed that there should be more focus on long-term trade policy courses rather than 2-3 day workshops and seminars. He drew Members' attention to the outreach activities on page 29 of document WT/COMTD/W/104/Add.1/Rev.1. He thought that the limited resources available should not be overstretched. It was his impression that resources were being directed towards national parliaments and civil societies instead of addressing the core problems of building capacity within the relevant economic ministries in developing country members like Kenya. Converting some of the outreach courses into one or two regional trade policy courses would be cost effective in terms of utilising the funds available for TA. He said that the outreach courses might be necessary but he did not see how they fitted in the context of TA to his country. He asked the Secretariat to provide more information on those courses.

"4616",4616,"38","38.      Mr. Osakwe, Director, Technical Cooperation Division, said said that with respect to the outreach activities, Members should recall that WTO TA was member priority driven and that several of the outreach activities had been explicitly requested by members. The activities were also designed on the basis of mandates contained in paragraphs 10 and 38 of the Doha Ministerial Declaration. With respect to the NEPAD, he said that the WTO Secretariat had consulted with several delegates from Africa as well as the NEPAD Secretariat and the wording in the 2003 TA Plan reflected what had been agreed in those consultations. He agreed with the representative of Kenya that there needed to be a balance between the NEPAD continental wide activities and the NEPAD national activities. He said that the NEPAD Secretariat had undertaken to revert to the WTO Secretariat with in-country activities on a country to country basis, on which the Secretariat would report to Members. With respect to the JITAP programme he said that it was still under consultation between the ITC, UNCTAD and WTO Secretariats and the donor community. However, the WTO Secretariat was confident that a satisfactory solution would be found. He thanked the representative of Kenya for endorsing the Secretariat's guiding principle that TA Plans should be an integral part of national development plans.","WTCOMTDM43.pdf","Osakwe, Director, Technical, Cooperation, Division, Members, WTO, WTO, Secretariat, Africa, Secretariat, Kenya, Secretariat, WTO, Secretariat, Secretariat, Members, ITC, UNCTAD, WTO, WTO, Secretariat, Kenya, Secretariat"
"4617",4617,"39","39.     The representative of Djibouti said that the regional trade policy courses in Africa were of great importance to developing country members. Although they could not be expected to solve the development problems in Africa, they would help African officials familiarise themselves with the WTO rules. The three-month courses, the courses for LDCs and the three-week trade policy courses were all good examples of useful TA with which his delegation was satisfied. He agreed that it was important to involve regional development associations, but also to closely involve the host country in the preparations of the regional trade policy courses in order to avoid any problems. He hoped that the regional trade policy courses would be maintained in order to favour the integration of African country members into the multilateral trading system.","WTCOMTDM43.pdf","Djibouti, Africa, Africa, WTO, LDCs"

One delegation made reference to the desirability of focusing part of the annual evaluation on ad hoc activities in order to be able to take an informed view of the degree of flexibility with which the TA plan should be allowed to accommodate such activities. This will be difficult to do in respect of the 2002 plan since TCA has been focusing more on the ""regular"" part of the plan than on ad hoc activities. However, if Members desire, more attention can be paid in 2003 to such activities with a view to providing information in the Annual Report for that year. It would indeed be interesting to be able to compare ad hoc activities with planned ones in terms of impact, responsiveness and effectiveness.","WTCOMTDM43.pdf","United, States, RTA, India, Sri, Lanka, CRTA, TCA, Members"
"4619",4619,"40","40.      The representative of Zambia said that his delegation was pleased that the evaluation of the 2002 TA Plan had noted the success of the regional trade policy course that had been held in Nairobi. The fact that the budget figures had been reduced while the TA commitments still would be fulfilled was a success in financial management and planning. He said that it was important to consider the TA principles in relation to the needs of the LDCs. The WTO Plans were part of an evolving process. There had to be a common understanding of what the LDCs should expect before the details were discussed. He drew Members' attention to bullet point 6 of paragraph 4 on page 5 of document WT/COMTD/W/104/Rev.1 which stated that ""recipient countries have re-emphasized their preferred priorities in their TA/CB requests. Greater need has been expressed for capacity building for trade integration (stimulating supply-side responses, export diversification, etc)"". The bullet point went on to acknowledge that the WTO could not, except through co-ordinated arrangements with development agencies, bilateral donors and recipient countries themselves, deliver all of that on its own. He said that the table on page three of the same document indicated where the WTO could provide TA. He wished to discuss some of the principles for the WTO TA in that context. He would also consider the details reflected in the 2003 TA Plan. He informed the Committee that the LDCs had discussed their position at the 30th Session of the Sub-Committee on LDCs held on 7 November 2002. He thanked the Secretariat for its positive responses and comments regarding the statement made and issues raised by the LDCs at that meeting, and in particular for the steps that the WTO would take to ensure that UNCTAD and ITC were included in the 2003 TA Plan as WTO strategic partners, in order to address LDCs' concerns and interests that fell under their respective mandates which were different from the mandate of the WTO. His delegation welcomed the statement that the WTO Secretariat was ready to translate the policy statement made by the heads of the three agencies at their meeting held in Geneva on 30 October 2002, in which the heads of the agencies pledged ""to enhance their relationship across a range of activities including TRTA, research and the sharing of information"". He believed that that statement was broad enough to be incorporated into specific operational steps in the revised 2003 TA Plan. The 2003 TA Plan offered an opportunity for immediate implementation of that policy statement and encouraged the Secretariat to devise                                                                                     WT/COMTD/M/43                                                                                            Page 15 practical ways and means to achieve that objective. He hoped that the Secretariat would inform WTO Members on the arrangements made in that respect.","WTCOMTDM43.pdf","Zambia, Nairobi, WTO, Members, WTO, WTO, TA, WTO, Committee, LDCs, Secretariat, LDCs, WTO, UNCTAD, ITC, WTO, WTO, WTO, Secretariat, Geneva, Secretariat, Secretariat, WTO, Members"
"4620",4620,"41","41.     He went on to say that the LDCs were encouraged by the Secretariat's receptiveness to their suggestion to incorporate seven principles that they had devised into the revised 2003 TA Plan. Those principles related to the mandate of other international or regional agencies in the area of development-related issues which transcended the mandate of the WTO. The LDCs believed that making those principles an integral part of the 2003 TA Plan would go a long way in addressing their developmental concerns and interests. The statement regarding those principles had been distributed and was available to Members. He reiterated what those principles were, as the Secretariat had noted in document WT/COMTD/W/104/Rev.1, in terms of where the competency of both the WTO Secretariat and the other agencies lay and the priority which should be given to the needs of developing countries, in particular the LDCs. That meant that any assistance involving development and negotiating issues which went beyond the WTO legal framework should be based on close cooperation between the WTO and other development-oriented agencies. In that regard, the LDCs were of the view that in the future, the WTO TA Plans should always identify which activities required collaboration with other international agencies including the regional ones, and devise ways to implement them. He said that paragraph 2 (v) of the Decision on Measures in Favour of Least-Developed Countries stated that ""Least-developed countries shall be accorded substantially increased TA in the development, strengthening and diversification of their production and export bases including those of services, as well as in trade promotion, to enable them to maximize the benefits from liberalized access to markets."" He added that paragraph 30 on page 15 of WT/COMTD/W/104/Rev.1 stated that ""The 49 Least-Developed Countries have priority focus. They have the most urgent and acute trade development needs."" He mentioned that to encourage the Secretariat to reflect those principles in the activities and distribution of resources in the 2003 TA Plan. He concluded by requesting that the principles be translated into tangible benefits for LDCs.","WTCOMTDM43.pdf","LDCs, Secretariat, WTO, LDCs, Members, Secretariat, WTO, Secretariat, WTO, WTO, LDCs, WTO, Secretariat"
"4621",4621,"42","42.      The representative of Japan said that his delegation was willing to cooperate with the Secretariat in order to finalise the draft 2003 TA Plan so that activities could begin to be delivered by the start of 2003. He said that he would limit his intervention to six points. First, he said that among the reasons for the slippages from the 2003 TA Plan were the problems of joint delivery with other international organisations. His delegation had emphasised the importance of collaborating with other international agencies and his Government had made a commitment to financially support UNCTAD to jointly implement activities related to trade and investment to the Asia-Pacific member countries. He said that it was his delegation's understanding that that commitment had not been taken advantage of, and asked the Secretariat what the problem was, besides a lack of funding. Second, his delegation appreciated that the Secretariat had made an effort to address its concerns with respect to ad hoc activities. His Government had made an effort to mainstream TRTA in the context in its bilateral technical cooperation. He provided the example of the two day workshops that his Government had organised with the WTO in order to jointly implement certain trade and investment activities in Geneva. Those two-day workshops had caused concerns in terms of cost effectiveness. However he was pleased to mention that his Government bore 65 per cent of the cost of those activities. The workshops would be held back to back with the Working Group on Trade and Investment. His Government would cover the travel costs for participants from Anglophone African countries. He asked whether that type of activity was considered to be an ad hoc activity. Third, with respect to the regional trade policy courses, he said that he agreed with the representative of Switzerland that the selection of partner institutions was crucial and had to be transparent. The selection process had to be strategic because one of the main objectives of regional trade policy courses was to develop partnership arrangements and help in the creation of future institutions which could take over the responsibilities of the WTO in those countries. Fourth, with respect to the training module on S&D, he asked whether that activity related to what was being discussed in the Special Session of the CTD. Fifth, he asked what the nature of the internal note on trade clinics would be. He asked whether the WT/COMTD/M/43 Page 16 guidelines were going to be circulated to Members for comments or whether it was work in progress. Sixth, with respect to CRP(02)41 he said that his delegation had been surprised by the initial high budget figures for the draft 2003 TA Plan but was ready to study the revised figures. He did not agree with the suggestion made by the representative of Switzerland to change the 13 per cent overhead costs to real accounting figures. His experience was that such management would pose administration burdens on the Secretariat. What was required was transparency with respect to the overhead costs.","WTCOMTDM43.pdf","Japan, Secretariat, UNCTAD, Asia-Pacific, Secretariat, Secretariat, TRTA, WTO, Geneva, Working, Group, on, Trade, and, Investment, Switzerland, WTO, S&D, CTD, Members, Switzerland, Secretariat"
"4622",4622,"43","43.      Mr. Osakwe, Director, Technical Cooperation Division, thanked the representative of Japan for bringing to Members' attention the commitment made by the Government of Japan to provide resources to UNCTAD for activities on trade and investment carried out jointly with the WTO. He said that he would be pleased to report that to the Director-General and senior management. He said that the activities on trade and investment carried out in 2002 had gone well. UNCTAD had been responsible for and delivered four regional training activities in 2002. The WTO had delivered three of the four regional workshops which it was responsible for. The final one for the Anglophone African countries was to be held in Botswana. However, due to scheduling problems it would only be held in January 2003. He said that the Government of Japan had made the Secretariat's task easier with the trade and investment activities held back to back with the meetings of the Working Group on Trade and Investment that had been held in 2002 and those proposed for 2003. The Secretariat did not foresee any particular difficulties with the activities on investment. The challenge for all activities was posed by the large number of individual country requests for national activities in one particular area, which could not be delivered. In that case the Secretariat would attempt to collapse such demands for national activities into regional activities. He said that the back to back activities mentioned by the representative of Japan would normally be regarded as ad hoc activities, but it would be possible to accommodate them in the planning process by having early contacts on in order to schedule them. The Secretariat could schedule back to back activities with planned activities but that information had to be made available before the implementation year as they otherwise would cause unforeseen pressure. With respect to the regional trade policy courses, he said that two donor countries had approached the Secretariat and were willing to provide institutions in Asia and the Caribbean with the possibility to hold trade policy courses like the ones that had been held in Africa. The Secretariat was responding favourably to that and would report to Members. In response to the question posed with respect to the internal note on the guidelines on trade clinics, he said that that note was an operational document. However, the Secretariat would consult with interested members before putting it before senior management for approval.","WTCOMTDM43.pdf","Osakwe, Director, Technical, Cooperation, Division, Japan, Members, Japan, WTO, Director-General, UNCTAD, WTO, Botswana, Japan, Secretariat, Working, Group, on, Trade, and, Investment, Secretariat, Secretariat, Japan, Secretariat, Secretariat, Asia, Caribbean, Africa, Secretariat, Members, Secretariat"

"4624",4624,"45","45.       The representative of Paraguay said that he was making his statement on behalf of the GRULAC. He referred to the importance of the results of the regional trade policy courses held in Africa and said that document WT/COMTD/W/107 provided a good summary of the evaluation of those courses. His delegation believed that the regional trade policy courses were important because they offered the opportunity to attend trade policy courses in Geneva, to officials who would otherwise not have that opportunity. As had been mentioned by the representative of Barbados it would be important to organise such courses for countries in the GRULAC region. Although there was still a debate as to whether the courses should take place as set out in paragraph 92 of document WT/COMTD/W/107, light had been shed on the proposal made by the GRULAC as reflected in paragraph 4 on page 5 which referred to the ""Lessons from the implementation of the 2002 Annual TA/CB Plan"" and contained important aspects which were in line with the group's proposal. Those aspects included the recognition that the demand for TA was limitless and went beyond supply, and that it therefore was important to rationalise work and collaborate with other institutions. In order to meet the commitments set out by Ministers at the Doha Ministerial Conference, it was essential to establish clearly identified associations with other institutions in coordination with donor countries                                                                                     WT/COMTD/M/43                                                                                            Page 17 and to take advantage of the synergies created. Paragraph 4 also pointed out that recipient countries had already set their priorities and expressed a greater need for capacity building for trade integration (stimulating supply-side responses and export diversification) relative to capacity building for short term TA/CB for WTO negotiations. In that regard, the WTO could not deliver except through co- ordinated arrangements with development agencies and bilateral donors, and the recipient countries themselves. Bullet point 11 in paragraph 4 stated that ""there is a threshold capacity of the WTO Secretariat to deliver TA. This capacity threshold was attained in 2002."" He said that it was important to consider the experiences of those courses of which he had been a participant. He hoped that in 2003, within the framework of the Latin American Association and the Development Bank possibilities of holding courses in the GRULAC region could be discussed and different countries could host the long term courses. The main thrust of the GRULAC's proposal was reflected in paragraph 2 on page 1 of document WT/COMTD/W/107, which called for the increase in the number of government officials who could benefit from the long-term trade policy courses, giving a regional focus to the learning dispensed in those courses and the establishment of partnership arrangements with regionally based institutions of higher learning and local resource persons in order to ensure the transfer of knowledge in a sustainable manner.","WTCOMTDM43.pdf","Paraguay, Africa, Geneva, Barbados, GRULAC, Doha, Ministerial, Conference, WTO, WTO, WTO, Secretariat, Latin, American, Association, Development, Bank, GRULAC"
"4625",4625,"46","46.      The representative of the European Communities said that considerable progress had been made on the 2003 TA Plan following Members' discussions. He said that the Government of Germany had announced a pledge for 2003 and 2004 which would contribute to moving the issue of TA fast and productively. The 2003 TA Plan was a big programme and there were many issues at stake, some of which related to the experiences in 2002 and some which related to how those lessons would be reflected in the 2003 TA Plan. He said that he would pose some questions in order to get a better understanding of the different issues. His delegation agreed with the representative of Switzerland that it was important for Members to base themselves, as mentioned in paragraph 4 of document WT/COMTD/W/104/Rev.1 on the lessons learnt, the facts and information on the delivery of the 2002 TA Plan. He encouraged the Secretariat to provide Members with a report on the implementation of the 2002 TA Plan as soon as possible as basis for further discussions. With respect to the approximately 25 per cent of the activities that had been cancelled, he asked how that would be factored in into the 2003 TA Plan. He said that the reasons given for the cancellation of some of those activities were bound to reproduce themselves. The Fifth Ministerial Conference would put a lot of pressure on Members and there would thus be absorption problems with a risk of less activities being executed than planned. His delegation was still concerned about the capacity within the Secretariat to deliver the 2003 TA Plan. Members needed to realise that there would be a first real intense phase of negotiations before the Fifth Ministerial Conference in Cancun, and that the Secretariat would also have to fully service the negotiations. There was also the issue of quality versus quantity. If the Secretariat intended to focus on the quality of the activities delivered then there would be greater human resource needs for the implementation of the 2003 TA Plan than in the delivery of the 2002 TA Plan. He gave the example of the 50-60 activities in the 2002 TA Plan which only involved the travel to a conference. The Secretariat might find it difficult to replace those by more resource intensive activities.","WTCOMTDM43.pdf","European, Communities, Members, Germany, Switzerland, Members, Secretariat, Members, Members, Secretariat, Members, Cancun, Secretariat, Secretariat, Secretariat"
"4626",4626,"47","47.      He went on to the question of setting priorities within the 2003 TA Plan and said that although there should be a special focus on LDCs, his delegation had noted many instances where national and regional activities were planned on the same subject. He asked whether that was a prioritisation of activities in view of the scarce resources available. He also sought more information on the human resource implications of the trade clinics. He asked who was going to do what and how they were going to be planned if they constituted a significant part of the work to be carried out in 2003. His delegation hoped that the Secretariat could concentrate more on managing TA than actually delivering it. Issues relating to strategic partnerships and outsourcing had already been addressed by the Secretariat. With respect to ad hoc activities he said that the text in page 9 of document WT/COMTD/W/104/Rev.1 reflected real progress and a serious effort to address the issue WT/COMTD/M/43 Page 18 in a systematic matter. His delegation fully supported the attempt to discipline the number of ad-hoc activities. However, his delegation did not believe that any proposed replacement activity should be automatically accepted because there were other parameters of the TA Plan that still applied. For example, all activities still had to be mainstreamed and be compatible with the priorities of the Plan. Regarding the strategic partnerships, he said that it was a good sign that they were more thoroughly mentioned and that new activities involving the ITC and other organisations had been included. He asked whether the strategic partnerships mentioned had already been transposed into additional activities and enhanced cooperation in the list of activities in document WT/COMTD/W/104/Add.1 and whether they had already had an effect on the cost. He asked what the Secretariat would be doing with respect to the other organisations. With respect to the 2002 TA Plan he said that Members needed to get a better sense of how much had been provided by other organisations in order to be able to judge whether the approach in the draft 2003 TA Plan was realistic. On outsourcing, he said that he had been struck by the fact that the Secretariat felt that it had to be cost efficient. That was only one of the benefits when outsourcing. If an activity could be delivered by another organisation at the same cost then outsourcing would still alleviate the burden falling on the WTO Secretariat, provided the other organisation was one that the Secretariat and the Members were comfortable with. The Secretariat did not necessarily have to save money. However outsourcing should not be more expensive. Outsourcing was also a means to enable the Secretariat to concentrate on what its first priority should be, particularly in 2003. He said that there had to be more than two other organisations to which the Secretariat could outsource and his delegation looked forward to finding additional trustworthy partners. With respect to the regional trade policy courses held in Africa he said that his delegation was still considering the evaluation (WT/COMTD/W/107). He had been struck by the mixed conclusion in paragraph 91 which stated that ""There are no convincing grounds to argue that the African regional trade policy courses did not do what they set out to do."" That was a negative statement but the summary in paragraph 14 was more positive. He said that the report still gave rise to a number of questions. One was how Members could ensure that all tools were ready and all questions answered in order to factor in the experiences from 2002 into the 2003 regional trade policy courses into the 2003 TA Plan which his delegation supported in principle. He asked what the programme for the 2003 courses would look like and whether it would be possible to hold the courses in the Summer of 2003, just before the Fifth Ministerial Conference. He was not certain that government officials would be able to attend and that the Secretariat would be prepared to provide the necessary resources in that period. If the course was held in a different period, it would have different implications for the housing, the institutions available and the willingness of people to participate. He concluded by saying that his delegation was grateful for the attempt that had been made to reduce the cost of the 2003 TA Plan. He said that it was important to get the substance of the 2003 TA Plan right first. The issue of its cost could be considered once the answers to the questions raised had been given.","WTCOMTDM43.pdf","Secretariat, Secretariat, ITC, Secretariat, Members, Secretariat, WTO, Secretariat, Secretariat, Members, Secretariat, Secretariat, Secretariat, Africa, Members, Secretariat"

The aim had been to write a simple, factual report on the work of the CTD in regular and dedicated session as well as of the work of the Sub-Committee on LDCs. Delegations were requested to either take the floor or inform him or the Secretariat of any changes they might wish to see before noon, Thursday, 14 November 2002. He said that Members needed to adopt the Annual Report on Monday, 18 November 2002.

In addition, the Secretariat had provided general information on notifications made under the Enabling Clause. He was therefore not certain how the Committee could proceed further with that issue. 5.      Several references have been made to the allocation of resources for TA activities, and the impact of the planned activities on the Secretariat's capacity to deliver. These considerations are equally valid in terms of the work of TCA. If the kind of evaluation activities Members seem to be WT/COMTD/M/43 Page 46 demanding are to be possible, the monitoring and evaluation function needs to be strengthened, and more resources allocated to it. At the present time there is only one professional staff member assigned to these duties. The limitations this places on the scope of monitoring and evaluation activities are clear. 20 November 2002                                            __________","WTCOMTDM43.pdf","India, RTA, India, Sri, Lanka, CTD, Secretariat, Committee, Secretariat, TCA, Members"

"4632",4632,"52","52.      The representative of India thanked donors for their support for the 2002 TA activities, which he hoped would continue in 2003. His delegation had noted that the projected cost for the draft 2003 TA Plan had fallen from CHF 36.5 million to CHF 24.6 million. He said that DDG Abbot had, at the last meeting of the CTD, explained how the cost for the 2003 TA Plan could be reduced. His delegation asked for further details regarding the calculation of those cost estimates as he noted that the costs had fallen by almost a third while the number of activities remained more or less the same. The Secretariat had provided Members with an evaluation of the regional policy courses, but his delegation looked forward to also receiving an evaluation of the remaining activities carried out in 2002. With respect to the costing of TA activities, he said that the 13% overhead charge was supposed to cover the costs incurred by the Secretariat in organising the activities. That would include not only the overheads but also the cost of the time spent by Secretariat officials in organising the activities. In the Budget Committee, Members had been informed that 19 L-posts had been created to assist in the delivery of the TA activities. If the cost of maintaining those posts was charged to the TA budget then he did not see the justification for continuing to charge 13 per cent in overhead costs to the technical cooperation budget. It should be substantially less than that and he sought clarification as to why a 13 per cent overhead cost continued to be charged. He said that the last bullet point on page 13 of document WT/COMTD/W/104/Rev.1 stated that ""a TA/CB Programme Menu is under policy development"" and that ""Country priority preferences will be fit under the Programme Menu, which falls into 7 categories"" the first of which was outreach. The representative of Kenya commented on that at the previous meeting of the CTD and the Secretariat had clarified the situation by drawing upon paragraph 10 of the Doha Ministerial Declaration. At a previous meeting of the CTD, held on 8 October 2002, his delegation, while agreeing with the usefulness of such activities, noted that costs of such programmes should not be included in the budget of the TA plan. Outreach programmes could not be classified as TA. Ministers had clearly defined that ""The delivery of WTO TA shall be designed to assist developing and least-developed countries and low-income countries in transition to adjust to WTO rules and disciplines, implement obligations and exercise the rights of membership, including drawing on the benefits of an open, rules-based multilateral trading system.1"" Paragraph 6 on page 6 of document WT/COMTD/W/104.Rev.1 stated that ""The challenge of the 2003 WTO Annual Plan for TA/CB is to build capacity in the beneficiary countries for effective negotiations, legal implementation of WTO Agreements, and trade integration."" He did not see how outreach activities fitted into that. While his delegation supported the organisation of the suggested outreach activities, they should not be included as part of the 2003 TA Plan. That would result in less money being available for TA activities than would otherwise have been the case. He pointed out that references to TA in paragraph 41 of the Doha Ministerial Declaration did not include 1     WT/MIN(01)/DEC/W/1 WT/COMTD/M/43 Page 20 paragraph 10 that dealt with outreach activities. Ministers therefore had not intended that the outreach activities be part of the TA programme. His delegation therefore sought the deletion of the complete list of the outreach activities from the 2003 TA Plan. He found it surprising that there had been no reference made to TA activities in the index that had been prepared for document WT/COMTD/W/104/Rev.1 despite his delegation's referral to that in the previous meeting of the CTD.","WTCOMTDM43.pdf","India, Abbot, CTD, Secretariat, Members, Secretariat, Secretariat, Budget, Committee, Members, Kenya, CTD, Secretariat, CTD, TA, WTO, WTO, WTO, WTO, CTD"
"4633",4633,"53","53.      He went on to say that this his delegation welcomed the efforts to limit ad hoc activities to 5 per cent of the total activities. He recognised the need for flexibility but was surprised that as much as 28 per cetn of the activities organised by the Secretariat in 2002 were ad hoc activities. He suggested that when ad hoc requests were received they be consolidated and put forward to the CTD for approval. If for any reason an ad hoc activities had to be organised at short notice, he suggested that the views of the Chairman of the CTD be considered before the activity was organised. His delegation supported the fact that 47 percent of the planned national TA activities for 2002 would be directed to LDCs who required TA more than any other group of countries. He agreed with the statement in document WT/COMTD/W/104/Rev.1 that TA was not a substitute for market access and added that TA was not a substitute for accession. Accession was important for some LDCs and his delegation hoped that a decision could soon be reached in order to facilitate faster accession of LDCs into the WTO. In implementing the 2003 TA Plan reference was made to cooperation with the Bretton Woods Institutions and six Regional Development Banks. He sought clarification as to how that would function in practise and in what way the Secretariat depended on those institutions to assist in the delivery of TA activities.               He said that paragraph 41 of the document (WT/COMTD/W/104/Rev.1) made reference to the role that countries like India and Sri Lanka could play in the delivery of TA and sought clarification as to what the Secretariat had in mind in that respect. His Government had responded positively to suggestions made by the Secretariat about a year earlier but there had been no subsequent follow up. He informed Members that his Government, within its limited means, did extend some TA to other countries. His delegation welcomed the idea of including a module on S&D in WTO training activities and he suggested that the contents of the module be circulated in the Special Session of the CTD. Such a module would be useful in providing an insight into what the principles and objectives of S&D were. With respect to the internship programme for regional coordinators, he said that the document mentioned that regional coordinators would be selected by the regional organisations concerned. There were two slots provided for the South Asia Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC), but since SAARC did not have a coordinator he asked which member state of SAARC Secretariat had been consulted to identify the two countries that had been listed.","WTCOMTDM43.pdf","Secretariat, CTD, Chairman, CTD, WTO, Secretariat, India, Sri, Lanka, Secretariat, Secretariat, Members, WTO, CTD, South, Asia, Association, for, Regional, Cooperation, SAARC, SAARC, SAARC, Secretariat"
"4634",4634,"54","54.       The representative of Tanzania said that TRTA was vital for the LDCs and his delegation therefore had a vested interest in the activities that were being proposed in the 2003 TA Plan. He said that at the meeting of the CTD held on 11 November 2002, the Ambassador of Zambia, as coordinator of the LDC Group had reminded Members that the Uruguay Round Agreements specifically highlighted the importance that should be attached to TRTA for LDCs. That point had been re- emphasized at every Ministerial Conference and important meeting since the conclusion of the Uruguay Round. At the Doha Ministerial Conference TRTA had again found a place of prominence and the LDCs were viewing the 2003 TA Plan within that framework. Many LDCs had submitted their TA requests for 2003 to the Secretariat. Some had requested traditional seminars and workshops and others had requested activities that were more meaningful and went beyond that. Some Members had requested institutional support to strengthen their institutional capacity to implement the WTO Agreements and to participate effectively in the negotiating process. His delegation was pleased with the presence of Director-General Dr. Supachai when the CTD had first considered the 2003 TA Plan at its meeting on 8 October 2002. Dr. Supachai had outlined his vision for meaningful TRTA for LDCs. His delegation was pleased with Dr. Supachai's address and the fact that he took personal interest in the subject. When the details of the 2003 TA Plan had been put before Members, his delegation had noted that most of the LDC requests had not been taken into account by the Secretariat. Only three activities per LDC had been included in the draft 2003 TA                                                                                      WT/COMTD/M/43                                                                                             Page 21 Plan. Though that was disappointing, his delegation recognized the Secretariat's resource constraints. Given the Secretariat's limited capacity and the concerns expressed by the development partners, the Secretariat would not be able to implement a 2003 TA Plan which exceeded CHF 37 million. Although his delegation would have preferred a higher allocation for TRTA in the 2003 TA Plan, it was prepared to accept that as a compromise. At the meeting of the CTD held on 11 November 2002, DDG Abbott had informed Members that the revised 2003 TA Plan would only require funding amounting to CHF 24 million. His delegation was deeply concerned about that statement. First, it was not clear to his delegation which activities had been deleted to reduce the cost. It appeared that it was mainly the Geneva-based activities that had been removed. His delegation was of the view that some of the Geneva-based activities, for example the WTO internship programme, were effective means of capacity building for LDCs and should not be sacrificed under any circumstances. It was of interest for Members to see the list of deleted activities to ensure that no important activities were being excluded from the 2003 TA Plan in an attempt to reduce the cost. TA was a recurrent theme in the Doha Ministerial Declaration. Many members had emphasized that the rationale for the TRTA in the Doha Ministerial Declaration was to enable developing countries to understand the substance of the negotiations and to meaningfully participate in them. The initial cost estimate of CHF 37 million for the 2003 TA Plan was in reality a meagre amount compared to the large amounts that were being spent elsewhere. He urged that those activities for LDCs that had not been included earlier be included and, if necessary, by recourse to a supplementary budgetary allocation beyond the current request for CHF 24 million. The Secretariat had to clearly state how it planned to handle the question of strengthening institutions in LDCs, to enable them to deal with WTO matters more effectively on a long-term basis.","WTCOMTDM43.pdf","Tanzania, TRTA, LDCs, CTD, Ambassador, Zambia, LDC, Group, Members, Uruguay, Uruguay, Round, Doha, Ministerial, Conference, TRTA, LDCs, Secretariat, Members, WTO, Director-General, Supachai, CTD, Supachai, Supachai, Members, Secretariat, LDC, Secretariat, Secretariat, Secretariat, TRTA, CTD, DDG, Abbott, Members, WTO, LDCs, Members, TRTA, Secretariat, WTO"
"4635",4635,"55","55.      He further said that his delegation was concerned about the outreach activities referred to in pages 28 and 29 of document WT/COMTD/W/104/Add.1/Rev.1. He shared the views expressed by the representative of India. Those activities might be useful to disseminate information on WTO issues to a wider audience and to other stakeholders. The implementation of those programmes was therefore to be undertaken by the External Relations Division, and not by any other division of the WTO. However, no matter how well intentioned those programmes might be, his delegation did not understand why they should form part of the budget for TRTA. TRTA was driven by the DDA which required an in depth understanding of the WTO agreements and rules by actual negotiators. The TA that Members were considering for 2003 should concentrate only on developing the capacity of the member countries in relation to the negotiations and the implementation of the WTO Agreements. As the proposed outreach activities did not target the needs of the relevant participants in that process, he urged that those activities be handled under a different programme and that scarce resources for TA not be spent on them. He said that his delegation was prepared to recommend the CTD to accept the revised 2003 TA Plan so that it could be forwarded to the Budget Committee with the following conditions. First, additional activities for the LDCs would be taken up at a later date and, if necessary, additional funds be sought for that purpose. Second, the target budget for TRTA in 2003 be increased back to CHF 37 million so as to facilitate the inclusion of activities for LDCs that had not been included earlier. Third, the WTO should pay increasing attention to developing institutional capacities in LDCs to enable them to deal with WTO matters. Fourth, the outreach activities should not form part of the 2003 TA Plan. Preferably, the External Relations Division, or any other division could propose those activities to the Budget Committee, but scarce funds for the TRTA programme should not be diverted for such purposes.","WTCOMTDM43.pdf","India, WTO, WTO, TRTA, DDA, WTO, Members, WTO, CTD, Budget, Committee, LDCs, TRTA, LDCs, WTO, WTO, Budget, Committee"
"4636",4636,"56","56.     The representative of Bangladesh said that his delegation realised that the revised 2003 TA Plan contained some adjustments to the national and regional activities. With the inclusion of two regional activities in the revised draft 2003 TA Plan the total number of activities had been increased from 441 to 443. In that sense his delegation did not see any major change in the revised 2003 TA Plan. His delegation had always emphasized that it was the quality rather than the quantity in the delivery of TA which would build true capacity. To develop real capacity the WTO Secretariat WT/COMTD/M/43 Page 22 needed to provide country specific support to LDCs. He hoped that the Secretariat would pay attention to that aspect when organising the courses listed in the draft 2003 TA Plan. His delegation was aware that the Secretariat had reduced the overall budget for the draft 2003 TA Plan from the original estimate of CHF 37 million to approximately CHF 24 million. Some activities that had been considered less valuable had surely been excluded. However, those could not be identified from the list that the Secretariat had provided. His delegation could not support the exclusion of activities that were important to LDCs, particularly in the context of the ongoing negotiations. He asked the Secretariat to identify the activities that had been excluded. He said that the Doha Ministerial Declaration repeatedly underscored the need for increased capacity building for LDCs and his delegation expected that more funds would be allocated for activities that helped develop the negotiating capacity of LDCs. He realised that the demand for TA was high and that it might be impossible for the WTO to meet all the demands due to the lack of human capacity and financial resources. However, his delegation believed that all activities that were useful to LDCs should be implemented and not jeopardized by funding problems. He said that he was particularly referring to the inclusion of institutional capacity building programmes for LDCs. His delegation had submitted a proposal for activities that would contribute to the strengthening of institutions in Bangladesh to deal with WTO issues. The Secretariat had informed his delegation that its proposals for TA would be considered in 2003 TA Plan and that steps had been taken to operationalise them.","WTCOMTDM43.pdf","Bangladesh, WTO, Secretariat, Secretariat, Secretariat, Secretariat, Secretariat, LDCs, WTO, LDCs, Bangladesh, WTO, Secretariat"
"4637",4637,"57","57.     He went on to say that his delegation supported the statement made by the representative of India regarding the proposed outreach activities in the draft 2002 TA Plan. He was not certain what the outreach activities implied but assumed that they involved familiarising parliamentarians and representatives of the civil society with WTO matters. Document WT/COMTD/W/104/Add.1/Rev.1 contained a total of twelve national and regional outreach activities, but his delegation was not aware of the amount of money that would be spent for that purpose. While his delegation appreciated the Secretariat's good intentions, he said that bringing a few parliamentarians attend a course for a few days in Geneva would not develop an understanding of WTO matters. It might rather create confusion about the negotiating process and the work of WTO. He therefore requested the Secretariat to exclude those types of awareness activities from the draft 2003 TA Plan and allocate the funds to areas which would contribute to the capacity building of LDCs. He said that it was clear from the evaluation report that the regional trade policy course held in Nairobi was regarded as highly effective. He requested the Secretariat to conduct a regional trade policy course in Bangladesh to allow the trade practitioners of the Asian region could better understand WTO matters.","WTCOMTDM43.pdf","India, WTO, Secretariat, Geneva, WTO, WTO, Secretariat, Nairobi, Secretariat, Bangladesh, WTO"
"4638",4638,"58","58.      The representative of Australia said that his delegation could support the broad thrust of the draft 2003 TA Plan, particularly its focus on effective participation in trade negotiations and the pursuit of trade integration activities. His delegation, like many others, was still interested in a proper audit and evaluation of the 2002 TA Plan which would be important in fine tuning the 2003 TA Plan and asked what the status of the 2002 audit was. He said that his delegation was interested in the possibility of outsourcing as an option for the delivery of some of the WTO TA activities. His delegation was also interested in the criteria that the Secretariat was currently using for outsourcing. His delegation looked forward to further discussions on outsourcing as it was an important option to consider, particularly in light of the pressure that the Secretariat was facing and which would increase in the period before the Fifth Ministerial Conference. His delegation appreciated the efforts that had been made to reduce the cost of the 2003 TA Plan. The new figure was more realistic and would help secure the appropriate support for the draft 2003 TA Plan from members' treasuries. His delegation was surprised that no reference had been made to the Pacific Islands, particularly in sections II and X of the draft 2003 TA Plan which identified regions that faced particular challenges. He was certain that Members were aware that the Asia and Pacific region was a key beneficiary of the Australian Government's development related activities, including TRTA. Within that region the South Pacific was an area in particular need which received special attention. Pacific island countries faced particular difficulties in adapting their economies to take advantage of increased global trade and economic integration. Three Pacific island countries were Members of the WTO which might not be evident as their officials rarely participated in WTO meetings. That underscored the difficulties that                                                                                      WT/COMTD/M/43                                                                                             Page 23 they, and other many small member countries, faced. In the Pacific there were particular problems relating to distance and the fact that the economies were small and remote from markets and vulnerable to natural disasters and economic forces. Having recognised the lack of any mention in the draft 2003 TA Plan of the Pacific islands, his delegation had used the period since the previous meeting to propose some language to the Secretariat which would rectify the situation and which his delegation was willing to circulate to all interested members. The Pacific islands needed to be included in the draft 2003 TA Plan because of their relevance to the work that his Government hoped to achieve through TRTA. Their inclusion was also important for his Government's support of the draft 2003 TA Plan.","WTCOMTDM43.pdf","Australia, WTO, Secretariat, Secretariat, Pacific, Islands, Members, Asia, South, Pacific, Members, WTO, WTO, Pacific, Pacific, Secretariat, Pacific, TRTA"
"4639",4639,"59","59.      The representative of the United States said that her delegation was willing to work expeditiously to ensure that the best possible TA would be delivered in the critical year of 2003. She had noted improvements to the revised 2003 TA Plan, not just in terms of the revised cost which represented a more realistic figure given the fact that many members were already at the end of their budget cycles. She hoped that the concerns raised by her delegation at the previous meeting of the CTD would be answered. She also had some additional questions. The cost analysis carried out for the draft 2003 TA Plan had been carefully reviewed by her authorities. She highlighted her delegation's concerns with respect to redundant activities. Her delegation wished Members to consider the 2002 TA Plan and learn lessons for the future. Progressive graduated programmes should be provided in order for the participants to the various activities to move up the skills chain. Getting more clarity regarding the level at which the different courses were being offered would help Members assess whether the needs of beneficiary countries were actually being met. Her delegation shared the view that providing Members with an evaluation as the plan progressed would provide greater accountability and account of the costs throughout the year. That would prevent Members from approving a plan without having all the data and the time needed to consider that data on activities implemented during the course of the previous year. It would therefore be useful to build in a periodic reporting process, possibly in the form of quarterly reports on the delivery of the 2003 TA Plan, both in terms of the quality, the number and the cost of the activities implemented. If money needed to be redirected because of shortfalls in the budget or cancelled activities, Members would discuss how that could be done and be actively engaged in the process throughout the year.","WTCOMTDM43.pdf","United, States, CTD, Members, Members, Members, Members, Members"
"4640",4640,"6","6.       The representative of the United States sought the guidance of the Chairman on the way forward. Her delegation had simply sought to indicate that while notification to the CTD was an acceptable and important part of the process, there was a transparency obligation with respect to the notifications RTAs process. Her delegation did not believe that that process in total had been concluded by a notification to the CTD although that was the first step.","WTCOMTDM43.pdf","United, States, Chairman, CTD, CTD"
"4641",4641,"60","60.      She went on to say that the Secretariat's evaluation of the regional trade policy courses held in Nairobi and Casablanca suggested that it was worthwhile to continue those programmes but that they could benefit from greater guidance. Her delegation continued to be concerned about the impact of those courses on the use of the Secretariat's resources. She suggested that it might be useful to try to augment the Secretariat's resources by creating an advisory body that would help identify areas for future expansion and determine what universities or associates the Secretariat might work with. She knew of a number of individuals from the university community in the United States who were experts in managing programmes at the university level who might be willing to participate and she suspected that other member countries processed a similar type of expertise. She did not think that that would be difficult to set up but felt that it might help Members to turn the courses into a sustainable projects for the future. She noted that Members had still not received the precise accounting of the regional trade policy courses held in Casablanca. Her authorities wished to receive those figures. Her delegation was pleased that progress had been made with respect to the draft 2003 TA Plan. Members needed to take careful note of the lessons learnt in terms of cost, implementation problems and feedback regarding course modules. More important, Members needed to ensure that cost effective programmes were being developed within the agreed budget. She asked the Secretariat how the critical assessment and quality evaluations would be built into the draft 2003 TA Plan. Her delegation wondered whether Members and the Secretariat could work with the beneficiary countries to get discounts for those travelling from the national airlines or receive the assistance of beneficiary Governments to ask for reduced rates at hotels or establishing budgetary guidelines such as the use of economy class only for all travel. Those were issues that her delegation felt that donors, recipients, WT/COMTD/M/43 Page 24 and the Secretariat could work on together to ensure that the funds available were being used in the most efficient way. Her delegation remained concerned about the overlap of the regional trade policy courses in Africa and the work of the Training Institute. Her delegation hoped to see more coordination within the Secretariat on the TA Plan, the training programmes, and the regional training courses. Her delegation wished to get answers to its questions before proceeding with the action on the draft 2003 TA Plan.","WTCOMTDM43.pdf","Secretariat, Nairobi, Casablanca, Secretariat, Secretariat, Secretariat, United, States, Members, Members, Casablanca, Members, Members, Secretariat, Members, Secretariat, Secretariat, Africa, Training, Institute, Secretariat"
"4642",4642,"61","61.      The representative of Venezuela said that his delegation hoped that the 2003 TA Plan would be successfully implemented and that budget cuts would be offset by the effective delivery of the scheduled activities, which he believed could meet Members needs and expectations. His delegation agreed with the comments made by the representative of Paraguay at the last meeting of the CTD on behalf of the GRULAC, especially with respect to the need to extend trade policy courses to other regions. An activity designed for a regional group of participants could be more focused on regional issues than the courses held in Geneva where training was given to a fairly heterogeneous group of participants. He believed the regional trade policy courses could respond to the specific needs particular to his region. He agreed with the suggestions made by the representatives of Barbados and the United States, that it would be ideal to take advantage of a region's academic and institutional potential and to work jointly with those institutions in the preparation and implementation of regional activities. That would help tailor the activities and make them more responsive to specific scenari and perhaps even lead to a reduction in costs for the Secretariat without jeopardizing the quality or professional level of the activities. His delegation believed that TA and training needed to go beyond the provision of information on complying with obligations to commitments and understanding implementation issues. Instead, the focus needed to be on capacity building for national institutions to implement productive development policies that were in line with WTO obligations. At the previous meeting of the CTD, his delegation had indicated that a process of consultations had taken place to reflect Members' priorities. He noted that the Secretariat had collaborated with regional donors in order to optimize the use of resources for TA. It was important to pursue the efforts made in identifying focus areas for such activities in order to enhance TA delivered by the WTO and to translate that into effective capacity building.","WTCOMTDM43.pdf","Venezuela, Members, Paraguay, CTD, Geneva, Barbados, United, States, Secretariat, WTO, CTD, Members, Secretariat, WTO"
"4643",4643,"62","62.      He went on to say that his delegation had observed that WTO technical cooperation focused on promoting courses that explained the WTO Agreements. Given the negotiating process that Members were facing, his delegation considered that as a good opportunity to rethink the nature of technical cooperation and take a step towards developing more direct forms of cooperation, including institutional capacity building, for example by preparing specialized manuals, establishing infrastructure, promoting a better understanding of negotiating processes, and enhancing skills to draft proposals. Member the GRULAC region needed to gain a clearer understanding of the effect and impact of agreements in the different areas of negotiations. That was where efforts needed to be focused. That was the time to consider close relationships with other organizations such as UNCTAD and how WTO resources could promote capacity building programmes in UNCTAD. He understood that many other organisations had experience in capacity building but that they in many cases they lacked the resources to develop large-scale programmes. His delegation understood that the Secretariat was under-staffed and could not devote itself exclusively to delivering TA. The Secretariat was at a stage where courses such as those that explained the Agreements, could be delivered electronically as a form of distance learning. The focus could then be on technical cooperation for infrastructure and technology. His delegation was concerned that the activities for his country's region had not been divided into different groups as had previously been the case. That could result in language problems.","WTCOMTDM43.pdf","WTO, WTO, Members, Member, UNCTAD, WTO, UNCTAD, Secretariat, Secretariat"
"4644",4644,"63","63.      The representative of Canada said that the information that the Secretariat had provided was critical for ensuring accountability. To ensure full accountability Members needed to receive complete information regarding the 2002 TA Plan, including information on the number of person- days, including travel days and out of office days, involved in delivering the Plan. Her delegation had requested that information and understood that it would be provided to Members when available. Full                                                                                       WT/COMTD/M/43                                                                                              Page 25 and complete accounting of that nature was consistent with standard accounting procedures. She also asked the Secretariat to provide further details on its standard costs as they were refined. With respect to the ad hoc activities she said that her delegation appreciated the Secretariat's transparency and requested that at the end of the year, the Secretariat provide Members with a full and costed account of all ad hoc activities that had taken place in 2002. she further requested the Secretariat to include, in the evaluation of the 2002 TA Plan, a section on the ad hoc activities since they constituted such a large proportion of the activities that had been delivered in 2002. While it was important to plan as much as possible in advance, some flexibility had to be built into the 2003 TA Plan. Her delegation recognised that the Secretariat had built in a 5 per cent flexibility for ad hoc activities and wondered whether that was sufficient. There was a large gap between the aim of 5 per cent for 2003 and the 29 per cent ad hoc activities carried out in 2002. While there would always be a need for flexibility her delegation suggested that the Secretariat consider whether 5 per cent was sufficient. Her delegation was pleased to see that the Secretariat had included guidelines governing ad hoc activities in the 2003 TA Plan and hoped that those guidelines would assist in the decision making process. She said that the representative of Japan had requested more details on the trade clinics. Her delegation understood there to be a close relationship between the managing of the ad hoc activities and the trade clinics. She requested that the Secretariat considered guidelines for the trade clinics as well.","WTCOMTDM43.pdf","Canada, Secretariat, Members, Members, Secretariat, Secretariat, Secretariat, Members, Secretariat, Secretariat, Secretariat, Secretariat, Japan, Secretariat"
"4645",4645,"64","64.      She went on to say that it was good that the revised draft 203 TA Plan had been rationalised. Her delegation realised the importance of limiting the delivery of TA to a manageable set of activities within the Secretariat's area of expertise. At the same time, the WTO had to act as a coordinator for activities that were best executed by other agencies with appropriate experience. She said that if beneficiaries and other members could agree in principle to the draft 2003 TA Plan, then her delegation was prepared to do the same but with a number of conditions, some of which had been stated by other members. The representative of Kenya had at the previous meeting of the CTD, suggested that requests in future plans should be costed so that Members could determine the opportunity costs and benefits of what was being suggested before they made any decisions. Her delegation requested that Members receive a clear accounting of how much of the Global Trust Fund would be available for roll-over into 2003, including Window 2 funds, and how the Secretariat proposed to use those funds. Though it was impossible at that time, she requested that the Secretariat develop guidelines for the use of Global Trust Fund funds in the future. In considering future funding commitments, donors needed to be reassured that the Secretariat had a solid and defendable framework in place for prioritising the large number of TA/CB requests it received from developing countries. Such guidelines were also needed for transparency and sound fiscal management. As far as reporting was concerned, she agreed with the representative of India that there needed to be a report that included information on where new ad hoc activities replaced planned activities, what activities they replaced, what activities had been cancelled, the reasons for that and what activities had been completed. That could be provided on a quarterly basis as the representative of the United States had suggested. Members needed to know how the 2003 TA Plan was implemented as the year progressed. She recommended another revision of the draft 2003 TA Plan which would align it more with the structure of the database because Members needed to know that what they were doing in the WTO was manageable within the context of the database. With respect to the regional trade policy course held in Nairobi and Casablanca, she said that her Government was willing to consider providing some funding for a similar course in the Caribbean. However, before confirming that funding her delegation needed to get assurances that it would be possible to carry out such a course given the limited resources in the Secretariat. Her delegation supported the idea of the representative of the Unites States of having an advisory body to monitor the TA plan.","WTCOMTDM43.pdf","Secretariat, WTO, Kenya, CTD, Members, Members, Secretariat, Secretariat, Global, Trust, Fund, Secretariat, India, United, States, Members, Members, WTO, Nairobi, Casablanca, Caribbean, Secretariat, Unites, States"
"4646",4646,"65","65.      The representative of Switzerland said that his delegation could agree with the draft 2003 TA Plan with the condition that there be future improvements and consolidation of the TA plan. He said that he would make two points, the first related to the instruments of the 2003 TA Plan and the second related to the scope of the 2003 TA Plan. First, in relation to the instruments of the 2003 TA Plan he WT/COMTD/M/43 Page 26 said that the planning of the programme of WTO TA should rely on past experience and evaluation of previous activities. That was not yet the case and that was why the technical cooperation audit was so important. His delegation believed that the Technical Cooperation Audit Unit should be strengthened. The draft 2003 TA Plan included a number of untested instruments such as the regional seminars for WTO reference centres. He asked how the Secretariat saw the future of those centres in relation to the regional seminars and the build up of partner institutions under those regional seminars. Many delegations had mentioned trade clinics and he noted many possible synergies between the trade clinics and the goal of monitoring S&D. Trade clinics could be a means for direct contact with member countries on the difficulties they experienced with TA and in implementing trade rules. That needed to be explored as that was what the monitoring system was meant for. With respect to a future activity mix he said that distance learning was something the Secretariat needed to explore. The workshops and seminars, which currently were the most important instruments, were untested instruments. However, his delegation doubted whether they should be the main instruments. There was no clear evaluation showing what instruments to use in the future. There needed to be a well justified mix of complimentary instruments. There was also a need for specific goals and benchmarks and an evaluated programme which Members could base the next stage on. Second, in relation to the scope of the 2003 TA Plan, he said that there was a clear problem of capacity. The draft 2003 TA Plan (WT/COMTD/W/104/Add.1/Rev.1) contained 443 activities. However, the number would depend on the modes and instruments of delivery of the programme. It was difficult to justify the resource implications of such a threshold. His delegation believed that that was a maximum. Contrary to what the representative of Tanzania had said, his delegation did not believe that the Secretariat should go back to a bigger programme. That was not because his delegation did not understand the need. However, over time the Secretariat needed to undertake more training for trainers programmes and outsource more. In three to four years time there should be a WTO TA programme with four components. The first should be coordination, and the Secretariat had already showed that it had those links; the second should be quality control of TA programmes in the trade field; the third might involve having part of the financing for outsourced programmes going through the WTO; and fourth a small core WTO TA programme, much smaller than the present programme, related to the operations of the WTO.","WTCOMTDM43.pdf","Switzerland, WTO, WTO, Secretariat, S&D, Secretariat, Members, Tanzania, Secretariat, Secretariat, WTO, Secretariat, WTO, WTO, WTO"
"4647",4647,"66","66.      The representative of Colombia said that she would pose some questions relating to document WT/COMTD/W/104/Rev.1 in order to get a better understanding of the draft 2003 TA Plan. Section VI on ""Systematic, Cumulative and Sustainable Capacity Building: new products"", contained regional training-of-trainers workshops, the implementation of which would take place through the reference centres. The creation of those workshops was positive because they seemed to be geared towards building capacity over the medium and long term while at the same time expand the institutional capacity that was so important to countries such as Colombia. In that connection, she asked how the courses would be implemented and how they differed from the training-for-trainers programmes being developed by the Training Institute. Her delegation believed that it was important to ensure high quality delivery of those activities and consider the experiences and knowledge available in other divisions of the Secretariat in order to avoid a duplication of efforts. She asked whether that activity would be developed in countries that did not have reference centres but which regarded it as an important activity. A series of activities relating to trade policy reviews were also included in section VI of the Secretariat document. Her delegation understood that to be part of the dynamics of the Trade Policy Review Body. She asked whether that was an additional activity to the three activities assigned to each country, or whether they formed part of the TA activities under the DDA.","WTCOMTDM43.pdf","Colombia, Colombia, Training, Institute, Secretariat, Secretariat, DDA"
"4648",4648,"67","67.     She went on to report on the informal group of members that had met to discuss the 2003 TA Plan and that her delegation had coordinated. The meeting held on 4 November 2002 had been attended by a group of developing and least-developed countries. A number of points had emerged from those discussions. First, it was important to ensure that TA/CB activities scheduled in the 2003 TA Plan were directed at increasing institutional capacity in developing countries. Second transparency in the preparation of the TA plans was essential. The Secretariat would therefore need to                                                                                      WT/COMTD/M/43                                                                                             Page 27 work in close cooperation with the beneficiary countries, who were to a large extent aware of their own training requirements. Third TA was a multidisciplinary process, and TA activities should therefore take account of the specificities of each country or region. It was important to take the disparities in countries' economies and levels of development into account. TA activities needed to be dynamic and flexible so as to adjust to the needs and expectations of the beneficiary countries. Fourth, it was important to achieve better coherence and coordination with other TA providers. That would ensure ever-increasing efficiency and effectiveness and enable the use of the specific know- how of other international agencies. Fifth, the development of a TA activities menu should be further explored. Such a menu should offer the beneficiary countries a broad range of options encompassing different types of programmes in a variety of areas and sectors, adapted to different levels of knowledge and which could be adjusted to the needs of each recipient. Sixth, it was important to improve the process of evaluation and follow-up of the TA activities delivered by the Secretariat in developing countries. She said that her delegation believed that it would be interesting to have a few pre-defined criteria that would enhance the efficiency of such evaluations. Seventh, she said that it would be interesting for the beneficiary countries to maintain an ongoing dialogue with the donors and the Secretariat on the evaluation of TA, so as to achieve an overall improvement in WTO TA and be able to implement the commitments in the Doha Ministerial Declaration.","WTCOMTDM43.pdf","Secretariat, Secretariat, Secretariat, WTO"
"4649",4649,"68","68.      The representative of China said that the TA activities carried out in 2002 played an important role in helping the developing countries better understand the issues relating to the implementation of the existing WTO Agreements and the DDA and enhance their participation in the multilateral trading system, particularly in the new negotiations. Members had experienced the first year of the negotiations within the framework of the DDA and there were at least another two years to go if Members were optimistic enough to believe that the negotiations could be concluded within the time frame fixed by Ministers at the Doha Ministerial Conference. A lot of work remained to be done by the Members, and the Secretariat in the area of capacity building and technical cooperation. His delegation endorsed the draft 2003 TA Plan and had taken note of its new characteristic. His delegation believed that capacity building and technical cooperation should be member and needs driven and specifically designed to meet different members' needs. In that regard he agreed with the representative of Canada that sufficient flexibility needed to be given to the Secretariat with respect to responding to ad hoc requests from members, as long as those requests were within the financial and human resource constraints of the Secretariat.","WTCOMTDM43.pdf","China, WTO, DDA, Members, DDA, Members, Doha, Ministerial, Conference, Members, Secretariat, Canada, Secretariat, Secretariat"
"4650",4650,"69","69.      The representative of New Zealand said that her delegation supported the request that had been made by the representative of Australia to the identify the Pacific Islands as a region with special challenges in section X of the 2003 TA Plan. Those member countries were not represented in Geneva and could therefore not make that request themselves. She said that Members might have been aware that her Government currently earmarked its Global Trust Fund contributions for those countries in order to ensure that they would not be overlooked in the 2003 TA Plan. Her delegation appreciated that the practice of earmarking was unfashionable and her Government was therefore trying to review that practice. Any assurance that the special challenges of the countries in the Pacific Islands were being incorporated into the 2003 TA Plan would therefore be helpful to the review of her Government's tagging practice.","WTCOMTDM43.pdf","New, Zealand, Australia, Pacific, Islands, Geneva, Members, Global, Trust, Fund, Pacific, Islands"
"4651",4651,"7","7.     The Chairman said that it was his understanding that the RTA between India and Sri Lanka had been considered by the CTD and that the CTD had completed its task.

He suggested that the issue be discussed under ""Other Business"".","WTCOMTDM43.pdf","Chairman, RTA, India, Sri, Lanka, CTD, CTD, CTD, WTO"
"4652",4652,"70","70.     The representative of the Republic of Korea said that he was pleased to note that there had been a reduction in the cost of the 2003 TA Plan through cost sharing with other development agencies and an effort to streamline programmes. Nevertheless, his delegation shared the concerns expressed by other delegations regarding the funding of the 2003 TA Plan. In that regard he suggested that the Secretariat consider more cost effective ways of delivering TA, including greater collaboration with other development agencies, outsourcing some programmes and the use of information technologies for online education for example. His delegation believed that a certain degree of flexibility with respect to the ad hoc activities should be permitted in order to respond to WT/COMTD/M/43 Page 28 members' needs based on the process of the DDA negotiations and initiatives from donor countries. His delegation believed that seminars and workshops that had been carried out for specific negotiation skills in 2002 had been appreciated because they had been helpful in facilitating the discussions in the negotiation groups. Some flexibility for hosting such activities should therefore be incorporated in the 2003 TA Plan. At the same time, flexibility was required to facilitate that initiatives in donor countries' own TA plans be carried out in cooperation with the WTO Secretariat so as to contribute to the DDA negotiations. His delegation was concerned with the pressure on the Secretariat to both assist DDA negotiations and carry out WTO TA activities. Considering the number of activities in the 2003 TA Plan, Members needed to think of possible ways to reduce the Secretariat's load to a manageable level. Outsourcing was one way to address that concern, but Members needed to consider other options which his delegation believed existed.","WTCOMTDM43.pdf","Republic, of, Korea, Secretariat, DDA, WTO, Secretariat, DDA, Secretariat, DDA, WTO, Members, Secretariat, Members"
"4653",4653,"71","71.     The representative of Malaysia said that, as the 2003 TA Plan had been prepared much earlier than the 2002 TA Plan implementation could proceed in the beginning of 2003. Considering the large number of activities planned for 2003, her delegation was concerned that the quality of the activities could be affected by competing demands in the run up to the Fifth Ministerial Conference. Efforts needed to be maximised as early as possible so that Members would not experience any slippage in the implementation of the 2003 TA Plan at the end of 2003. She noted that the highest number of planned activities was in the area of capacity building. Although that seemed rather impressive, she noted that many of those activities were technical missions for trade policy reviews as well as national trade policy courses. Her delegation looked forward to see the inclusion of more technical capacity building programmes to build capacity in the area of negotiations, trade policy development, and the training-of-trainers in cooperation with other agencies if relevant. She said that there was a need to continuously upgrade the quality of TA activities and her delegation hoped that the Secretariat, Member Governments and partner agencies would work together to design programmes that would better meet members' needs. In that respect her delegation hoped that national skills could be improved through a series of well planned TA programmes designed to progressively take Members through a whole range of subject matters and result in broad and more comprehensive capacity building and training programmes. She agreed that Members would benefit from an evaluation of previous TA activities, not only in terms of financial accountability but also in terms of the performance levels, the difficulties encountered, onsite evaluations and feedback from beneficiaries. That would help to improve future TA plans. She concluded by saying that her delegation shared the concerns raised by some delegations in relation to the inclusion of the outreach activities in the 2003 TA Plan as it was not clear how those activities related to TA.","WTCOMTDM43.pdf","Malaysia, Members, Secretariat, Member, Members, Members"
"4654",4654,"72","72.     The representative of Argentina said that his delegation was generally satisfied with the 2003 TA Plan and particularly with the methodology followed to develop it based on consultations and dialogue with Members. He was also satisfied with the principles and criteria which shaped the draft 2003 TA Plan prepared by the Secretariat. His delegation appreciated the priority given to LDCs, which it found important and the fact that the draft 2003 TA Plan included activities for countries in accession. However, his delegation also shared the concern expressed by the delegation of India and other Members, about the relevance of including outreach activities in the 2003 TA Plan. His delegation agreed that those activities were important, but wondered whether it was appropriate to include them as a chapter of the 2003 TA Plan, or whether they could be considered in other areas of the WTO. The trade policy courses in Nairobi and Casablanca, constituted a good experience and were worthwhile continuing. In that respect he shared what the delegation of Paraguay had indicated on behalf of the GRULAC the previous week, and what the representative of Venezuela had just recalled, that the possibility of holding such courses in other developing country regions including the GRULAC, should be explored.","WTCOMTDM43.pdf","Argentina, Members, Secretariat, India, Members, WTO, Nairobi, Casablanca, Paraguay, Venezuela"
"4655",4655,"73","73.     The representative of Mexico said that in principle his delegation could accept the 2003 TA Plan, but had two comments to make. First, he said that the 2003 TA Plan did not contain certain aspects and it was important that those be included in future TA plans. His delegation had submitted a proposal in the Committee on Technical Barriers to Trade (G/TBT/W/189) on the creation of                                                                                      WT/COMTD/M/43                                                                                             Page 29 institutional capacity building in developing countries. His delegation noted with concern that there was still a focus on traditional TA activities which had the disadvantage of privileging the manpower in many government offices who would, after receiving the training, go to work in the private sector. That meant starting over with the training of new officials. That was a critical point that needed to be taken into account. Second, it was important to evaluate TA activities, not just in terms of whether the planned activities had been completed, but more importantly form the perspective of whether the activities carried out had been of use to the beneficiary country and with a view to making them more effective over time. Members would need guidelines and manuals relating to the quality of TA so that once an activity had been delivered, it could be evaluated at any given time.","WTCOMTDM43.pdf","Mexico, Committee, on, Technical, Barriers, to, Trade, Members"
"4656",4656,"74","74.     The representative of Cuba said that his delegation associated itself with the comments made by the representative of Columbia, with respect to the criteria agreed upon at the informal meeting attended by some members which had noted that the need for more TA to increase institutional capacity, for activities to be flexible enough to be adjusted to the most crucial needs of the beneficiary countries, and for better coherence and coordination with other TA providers. His delegation supported the comments made by the representative of Paraguay and the previous meeting of the CTD on the need to extend the regional trade policy courses to the Latin American region.","WTCOMTDM43.pdf","Cuba, Columbia, Paraguay, CTD"
"4657",4657,"75","75.     The representative of Norway said that his delegation had seen improvements to the draft 2003 TA Plan both in terms of substance and resources. However, his delegation was still not convinced that the Secretariat possessed sufficient human resources to carry out such an extensive Plan. Nevertheless, his delegation was in favour of the thrust of the revised 2003 TA Plan. His delegation believed that the creation of an advisory organ, as suggested by the representative of the United States, could be useful but Members needed to be careful not to fall into the pitfall of micro- management. He was puzzled by the concerns expressed, particularly by the representative of India, with respect to the outreach activities because it was difficult to understand how national consensus could be built for the advantages of WTO membership if parliamentarians and civil society were not well informed. Evaluation of the effectiveness and cost efficiency of WTO TA was important to enhance the effectiveness of future projects and his delegation looked forward to receiving such information in the future. Accountability was key to the success of TRTA.","WTCOMTDM43.pdf","Norway, Secretariat, United, States, Members, India, WTO, WTO"

His delegation felt that as NEPAD was still in its infancy the regional approach would be preferable to the NEPAD approach. That would give NEPAD time to mature.","WTCOMTDM43.pdf","Zimbabwe"

The representative of Thailand said that her delegation was generally in support of the revised 2003 TA Plan but said that she had some questions in relation to the fourth bullet point of section VI that related to the regional co-ordinator internships. She asked what the criteria was for choosing the participants of such internships. With respect to the ad hoc activities, she said that her delegation could support the issue of flexibility but felt that those activities should not affect the overall budget.","WTCOMTDM43.pdf","Thailand"
"4660",4660,"78","78.     The representative of Kenya said that the only way that institutional capacity could be built in developing countries, especially in Africa, was through regional courses such as the ones that had been held in Nairobi and Casablanca. He said that the Nairobi courses had been successful and some of those who had attended those courses were participating in the current negotiations on agriculture. If the regional trade policy courses would be included in the 2003 TA Plan as promised by the Secretariat, he said that Members needed to know when those courses would be held so that preparations could begin given that the Training Institute had previously not had sufficient time to prepare them. His delegation was surprised at the suggestion made by the representative of the United States on the creation of a trade and advisory body. He assumed that the idea was to consider all trade WT/COMTD/M/43 Page 30 policy courses and not just the regional courses held in Nairobi and Casablanca. Those regional courses had already undergone a sufficient evaluation and did not require another body to evaluate them.","WTCOMTDM43.pdf","Kenya, Africa, Nairobi, Casablanca, Nairobi, Secretariat, Members, Training, Institute, United, States, Nairobi, Casablanca"
"4661",4661,"79","79.      The representative of Uganda said that his delegation agreed that TA/CB could play a critical role in helping developing countries, in particular the LDCs, to integrate into the multilateral trading system. He said that any assistance to enable developing countries to understand their rights and implement obligations, or to train their trade negotiators meant very little, if those countries did not have anything to trade, or if what they had to trade, was already covered under existing trade preference schemes. That was why his delegation believed that, when TA activities were elaborated, the emphasis had to be placed on section XIII of document WT/COMTD/W/104.Rev.1 which related to strategic partnerships between the WTO Secretariat and other international agencies, regional development banks and the Development Assistance Committee of the Organisation for Economic Co-Operation and Development (OECD-DAC). In that regard, he suggested that the Secretariat brief Members on the outcome of such initiatives already undertaken. He said that TA/CB were only part of the single undertaking agreed upon by Ministers at the Doha Ministerial Conference. Therefore TA/CB was just one of the aspects of integrating developing countries particularly LDCs, into the multilateral trading system. Other ways included helping those countries to address their supply side constraints. The best TA/CB that the WTO could offer to those countries was to take on board their concerns, especially in the areas of S&D and in relation to implementation related problems and concerns.","WTCOMTDM43.pdf","Uganda, WTO, Secretariat, Development, Assistance, Committee, of, the, Organisation, for, Economic, Co-Operation, and, Development, Secretariat, Members, Doha, Ministerial, Conference, WTO"

"4663",4663,"80","80.      The representative of the European Communities said that Members generally agreed that they wished to arrive at the best possible TA plan, given the budget available. They also seemed to agree that the question of accountability had to be addressed. His delegation supported the point made by the representative of Norway with respect to the outreach programmes. He said that Members had attempted to include some of those activities in the normal budget. Some developing country members had then said that they did not wish to pay for those activities. It was suggested that those activities be part of the Trust Fund which had an important element to ensure that capacity was being built for integration of trade in national policies. Such programmes would not work unless parliaments and civil societies supported them. The outreach activities were an important element of TA and his delegation hoped to see them included in the draft 2003 TA Plan. There were only 12 outreach activities and his delegation did not feel that it was an issue that Members should spend too much time arguing about. His delegation was in a position to enable the Secretariat to go ahead and implement the 2003 TA Plan as long as there was a clear commitment from the Secretariat to follow up on the issues that Members had raised. He asked whether the Secretariat would be willing to commit to being guided by what Members had said indicate when it would provide some of the information Members had requested. In particular, he asked whether the Secretariat would provide the standard accounting, as recommended by the representative of Canada, by the time of the evaluation and provide account auditing by March 2003. The Secretariat needed to commit itself to prepare quarterly reports on replacement activities and activities carried out as well as commit itself to provide a full evaluation in March 2003 that would be discussed in the CTD with the aim of reviewing the then ongoing 2003 TA Plan and adapt it accordingly as was foreseen in the terms of reference. The Secretariat needed to also commit itself to consider more closely the terms of reference and all documentation which governed the access to the TA funds and replacement activities. That would include, among other things, a consideration of a possible continuation of the more interesting programmes such as the regional trade policy courses held in Africa. In addition, the Secretariat needed to commit itself to present a plan on increased outsourcing by March 2003, or earlier. It was important for delegations to be assured that nothing had been decided on the trade clinics, because they might be a way of falling back into the trap of ad hoc activities. There had to be clear terms of reference and a for any trade clinic. Any agreement on the draft 2003 TA Plan would not mean an unconditional acceptance of the trade clinics.

"4664",4664,"81","81.      Deputy Director-General Dr. Rana said that, although Members were currently considering the 2003 TA Plan, the Secretariat worked towards long term institutional capacity building. The regional trade policy courses held in Africa was one way in which the Secretariat aimed to build institutional capacity by working with local universities. The Training Institute had similar programmes and the three-week training-of-trainers courses enhanced the training capacity of those who would lecture at the regional courses. The Secretariat would not depend exclusively on its own human resources. Part of the technical assistance delivery could be outsourced. The Secretariat had already opened a roster for which it was identifying university professors as well as retired WTO Ambassadors and retired Secretariat staff who could supplement the scarce resources of the Secretariat. He assured Members that the Secretariat would consult more and would begin early to plan the 2004 TA Plan. It was important for the Secretariat to consult Members on all aspects of technical assistance and capacity building and not only with respect to the yearly TA plans. For example, it was important to discuss the regional trade policy courses as they were meant to fulfil the DDA plan of developing trade negotiation skills in developing countries and as the they were geared towards institutional capacity building. In that context he thanked the representative of Canada for mentioning that her Government was prepared to sponsor a regional trade policy course for Caribbean countries. The implementation of the 2003 TA Plan would be dynamic and the issues of coherence would be taken on board.","WTCOMTDM43.pdf","Director-General, Rana, Members, Secretariat, Africa, Secretariat, Training, Institute, Secretariat, Secretariat, WTO, Secretariat, Secretariat, Members, Secretariat, Secretariat, Members, DDA, Canada, Caribbean"

Mr Osakwe, Director, Technical Cooperation Division said that the reason for the inclusion of the NGO symposium on trade and environment in the draft 2003 TA Plan was past practice. Such symposia had been organised four times in the past: on 10-11 June 1994, 26-27 September 1996, 17- 18 March 1998, and 15-16 March1999. With respect to discussions held pre-Doha and post-Doha, there was an understanding that there was a rational for improving communications, transparency and relations, not just with civil society, but with the international public.","WTCOMTDM43.pdf","Osakwe, Director, Technical, Cooperation, Division, NGO"
"4676",4676,"92","92.      The representative of China said that his delegation did not challenge the holding of a symposium on trade and environment for NGOs. He asked whether the NGOs who would participate in the symposium were relevant to trade and environment issues. If the participants rather came from human rights or disarmament NGOs, then his delegation did not wish to see that activity included.","WTCOMTDM43.pdf","China"
"4677",4677,"93","93.      The representative of the European Communities said that there had been extensive informal consultations on whether and how to organise symposia in the past. The last was consultation in 1999 had ended in a general agreement that the Secretariat should go ahead and organise such symposia on the implicit understanding that they be organised on a regular basis. He said that Members could again have a fundamental debate on those issues. However, it would probably lead to the same conclusion that the Secretariat had a certain flexibility to organise such activities and that Members should trust the Secretariat to organise them in a way which would make sense. That included having a list of invitees which were in line with the mandate of the Secretariat. That meant to invite participants who possessed the relevant expertise and who were relevant for the discussions. He did believe that there was a danger of getting participants from human rights groups or other non trade- related NGOs. That had not happened in the past as far as he knew. With respect to the funding of the symposia, he said that their funding had been taken out of the regular budget in 2001 and that Members, as a compromise, had decided that it be financed from the Trust Fund as a capacity building activities. One reason was that most of the money was used to finance the participation of representatives from developing country NGOs to attend the symposia. That was also the purpose of having a separate budget line for such activities. It was a way of helping those who would not otherwise be able to attend a symposia in Geneva. He felt that it therefore was logical to keep those activities under capacity building. In that context Members needed to consider what capacity building was and it would be difficult to argue that the trade and environment symposium was not a capacity building activity. In addition, Members had agreed that it was important to synergise and make best use of the budget by holding more regional activities and less national activities. If the symposium was removed as a regional activity from the 2003 TA Plan some Members would probably request such a symposium as a national activity and Members would find themselves where they currently were. He agreed with the representative of Lesotho that it was difficult to refuse well founded national activities. That led him to pledged that members with doubts overcome them and not begin to consider each individual of the over four hundred activities, in order to allow for a smooth passage of the 2003 TA Plan in a time frame that would enable the Secretariat to start organising the activities in a timely manner.

He sought Members' guidance with respect to the trade and environment symposium for NGOs as he was not certain that there was a common understanding among Members about how to deal with it. He said that, after the clarification that had been provided, Members might be able to accept the regional workshops that would be held in cooperation with the Commonwealth Secretariat, the International Development Bank (IDB), and the Institute for the Integration of Latin America and the Caribbean (INTAL).

However, in light of the recent developments in the TNC, it was his WT/COMTD/M/44 Page 2 understanding that there was no need for the CTD to consider the matter further at that stage. He therefore proposed that item F be deleted from the agenda and that he would brief the incoming Chairperson of the CTD of the work carried out in the Committee and advise him to consult with the TNC Chairperson regarding further steps, if any, the CTD should take with respect to Article XVIII as an outstanding implementation issue.","WTCOMTDM44.pdf","Chairman, GATT, Committee, on, Trade, and, Development, CTD, Trade, Negotiations, Committee, TNC, TNC, CTD, Chairperson, CTD, Committee, TNC, Chairperson, CTD"
"4691",4691,"10","10.       He continued by saying that the existing rules of origin, applicable to the 90 per cent of the tariff lines which already entered duty and quota-free, had been extended to the products under the new initiative for LDCs with one exception. That exception related to textiles and apparel. The rules of origin originally established did not deal with textiles and apparel. Some textile products had already been granted duty-free access under the previous regime. However, the rules of origin did not take account of the current structure of world trade in textiles and apparel. The Government of Canada had therefore established new liberal rules of origin to cover textiles and apparel. There were two ways that an apparel product could qualify for the Canadian GSP scheme for LDCs. First, if the WT/COMTD/M/44 Page 4 product was entirely produced amongst any LDC and Canada. However, few products were currently produced that way because most LDCs did not have the capacity and the investment necessary to produce the fabric required for apparel. In order to ensure that the new initiative for LDCs was a genuine trade initiative, the Government of Canada had thus introduced a second means by which a product could qualify for the GSP scheme for LDCs. The new initiative permitted that accumulation of up to 75 per cent of the value of a product might originate in any country eligible for Canada's preferential tariff under the GSP scheme. More than 100 countries were eligible for Canada's preferential tariff under the GSP scheme. The intention was to make the new initiative a genuine development assistance program and keep entirely to the spirit of the Enabling Clause. That meant, with respect to textiles, that if the yarns had been made in any of those 100 countries or Canada, those yarns could be sent to any LDC and be turned into fabric. That fabric could then be sold to Canada and be considered as originating in the LDC and therefore receive duty and quota-free treatment.","WTCOMTDM44.pdf","LDCs, Canada, GSP, LDCs, Canada, LDCs, Canada, GSP, Canada, GSP, Canada, GSP, Canada, Canada, LDC"

Her delegation noted the rising interest among developing countries in RTAs and regional liberalization. That was a positive development which her delegation encouraged, and which her delegation believed that other WTO Members should encourage. Her Government was also pursuing bilateral and regional trade integration as well as multilateral efforts to promote more open trade among nations. She said that her delegation was pleased that other Members saw the value of more open markets with their neighbours. At the same, time her delegation had always believed that those agreements had to be consistent with WTO rules and that there should be a forum to allow Members to better understand them. Transparency in the trading system was a fundamental obligation and right in the WTO.","WTCOMTDM44.pdf","United, States, India-Sri, Lanka, RTA, CTD, WTO, Members, Members, WTO, Members, WTO"
"4694",4694,"102","102.    She went on to say that, at the 43rd Session of the CTD in November 2002, her delegation had requested the Committee to include an item on the agenda relating to notification procedures for RTAs among developing countries. The aim of that request was to consider positive steps the CTD could take to improve the review process for the purposes of greater transparency in RTAs. Paragraph 4 of the Enabling Clause specified that an opportunity for review and discussion had to be provided if interested WTO Members so requested. Her delegation was interested in a discussion and review of all such agreements. To begin the process, her delegation was finalizing a set of questions concerning the India-Sri Lanka RTA and looked forward to receiving responses to them. She hoped to provide both delegations with the questions within the next couple of days. The questions her delegation had developed requested some additional information of interest to all traders. Her delegation sought a better understanding of the basic nature and scope of the RTA and how it had WT/COMTD/M/44 Page 30 operated since its entry into force. As a practical matter, and in keeping with the various mandates of the respective WTO committees and councils, she said that it would be appropriate to consider questions and answers and any other follow-up in the Committee on Regional Trade Agreements (CRTA) rather than in the CTD, as highly technical questions were involved. The CRTA would therefore be a more appropriate forum given the expertise it had developed over time. A review in the CRTA did not in itself prejudge whether an agreement was subject to the Enabling Clause, Article XXIV of the GATT or Article V of the GATS. She noted that the CRTA had been notified of agreements under the Enabling Clause in the past as well as agreements under the GATT and the GATS and that the CRTA was in the process of reviewing a great number of such agreements. Her delegation wished to begin the process by raising questions and get an opportunity to consult, preferably in the CRTA. However, the CTD could also be involved if Members found that helpful as it had a mandate in that area. Her delegation was prepared to have a joint exercise of the CRTA and the CTD if there was such a desire. What her delegation considered necessary was a public discussion in order for all Members to be kept informed.","WTCOMTDM44.pdf","CTD, Committee, CTD, WTO, Members, India-Sri, Lanka, RTA, RTA, WTO, Committee, CRTA, CTD, CRTA, CRTA, GATT, CRTA, GATT, GATS, CRTA, CRTA, CTD, Members, CRTA, CTD, Members"

The Chairman said that it created a slight problem for the Committee that the delegation of the United States raised one particular RTA as that agreement had already been notified and discussed in the CTD. In fact, the CTD had already taken note of it. He agreed to deal with the item as a general issue but asked how the Committee could address an item that had already been settled.","WTCOMTDM44.pdf","Chairman, Committee, United, States, RTA, CTD, CTD, Committee"
"4696",4696,"104","104.      The representative of the United States said that her delegation was of the view that there was no time-limit for asking questions about specific RTAs, nor had her delegation forgone its right to raise it in the context of other committees' activities. She had simply used the example of a recently notified agreement. Her delegation was pleased that that RTA had been notified and was grateful to the parties to that agreement for having done so. However, that the CTD had taken note of the notification was not necessarily the end of the process. Her delegation was not trying to begin a process that was particularly burdensome. The questions her delegation would pose were not overwhelming in number or scope. Nevertheless, the India-Sri Lanka RTA could serve as an example for the Committee to consider a logical way of dealing with notifications of RTAs among developing countries in the future. Such agreements were proliferating. It was therefore an important point of principle to ensure that there was an opportunity for other members to raise questions when such agreements were notified. The Governments of India and Sri Lanka had chosen to notify their RTA to the CTD. That was why her delegation had raised the question in the CTD. There was another appropriate WTO body which had oversight over RTAs. However, she understood that there were differences of view on the appropriate forum. Her delegation did not only wish to discuss a particular agreement but also consider how notifications of RTAs among developing countries would be dealt with in the future. She said that her delegation welcomed any ideas about what an adequate approach for review would be in the CTD. The fact, that an agreement was notified under the Enabling Clause did not mean that other WTO Members did not have the right to raise questions and have them answered. Her delegation would welcome the participation of the CTD in the process.","WTCOMTDM44.pdf","United, States, RTA, CTD, India-Sri, Lanka, RTA, Committee, India, Sri, Lanka, RTA, CTD, CTD, WTO, CTD, WTO, Members, CTD"

"4698",4698,"106","106.    The representative of India said that the agenda item under discussion related to notification procedures for RTAs among developing countries and not to any particular RTA notified earlier under the Enabling Clause. At the 43rd Session of the CTD, when the representative of the United States had requested the inclusion of the agenda item, it had been clarified that the intention was to discuss the transparency aspect of RTAs notified under the Enabling Clause, not to discuss any specific RTA. The representative of the United States had raised a number of substantive points. However, since reference had been made to the RTA notified jointly by the Governments of India and Sri Lanka he said that he would reiterate his delegation's position. The India-Sri Lanka RTA had been notified to the CTD in June 2002 under the Enabling Clause. The notification had been put on the agenda of the                                                                                    WT/COMTD/M/44                                                                                           Page 31 CTD for its meeting in July 2002. At the request of some members, it had been kept on the agenda for the October 2002 meeting of the Committee. Members had therefore had ample opportunity to comment and share their observations on that notification. The Committee had thereafter proceeded to take note of the notification at its meeting in October 2002. In fact, the Secretariat had also been asked to provide a clarification regarding the notification procedures for RTAs notified under the Enabling Clause. The Enabling Clause provided for regional or global arrangements among developing countries for the mutual reduction or elimination of tariffs and all non-tariff measures. Such RTAs were notified to the CTD. His delegation did recognize the transparency obligations in paragraph 4(a) of the Enabling Clause. Keeping those transparency obligations in mind, the Governments of India and Sri Lanka had jointly notified their RTA to the CTD. His delegation believed that it had complied with the transparency obligations alluded to by the representative of the United States and fulfilled its obligations according to the practice in the CTD.","WTCOMTDM44.pdf","India, RTA, CTD, United, States, RTA, United, States, RTA, India, Sri, Lanka, India-Sri, Lanka, RTA, CTD, CTD, Committee, Members, Committee, Secretariat, CTD, India, Sri, Lanka, RTA, CTD, United, States, CTD"
"4699",4699,"107","107.    He continued by saying that the existing rules dealt with the issue of transparency for RTAs among developing countries in a sufficient manner. There was no need to revisit the issue. It had been mentioned that paragraph 4 of the Enabling Clause provided for some sort of review or examination. His delegation's view was that no examination was foreseen by the Enabling Clause. The practice in the CTD had been that RTAs under the Enabling Clause had been notified and Members had had the chance to comment and make observations. The notification had thereafter been taken note of by the Committee. With respect to the questions and answers mentioned by the representative of the United States he said that the Committee was not currently discussing any particular RTA. It was discussing transparency and notification procedures in general. He would not make any specific response with respect to the RTA between India and Sri Lanka as doing so would raise a more substantive issue in terms of the practice followed in the CTD for RTAs notified under the Enabling Clause. He said that, regarding the suggestion to also notify such agreements to the CRTA, his delegation maintained the view that the existing rules were sufficiently clear and addressed the question of transparency recognized in paragraph 4 of the Enabling Clause. Any additional onerous burden on developing countries, either in relation to notifications of RTAs to the CRTA or any review or examination was not warranted, particularly in view of the relatively small share of world trade covered by those RTAs.","WTCOMTDM44.pdf","CTD, Members, Committee, United, States, Committee, RTA, RTA, India, Sri, Lanka, CTD, CRTA, CRTA"
"4700",4700,"108","108.     The representative of the European Communities said that the delegation of the United States had raised what his delegation also considered to be an important issue that merited further consideration in the CTD. His delegation recognized the value of regional integration for developing countries, whether in the form of agreements between developing countries or between developing and developed countries. His delegation had gained much experience from its own practice of concluding agreements with developing countries. His delegation had also come to recognize that regional integration between developing countries was an important component of that process and a complement to the integration of developing countries into the Multilateral Trading System. It was important to consider the design and content of agreements between developing countries to ensure that they contributed to the development of the countries concerned. All members of the CTD had a strong interest in understanding and receiving information about the many RTAs concluded among developing countries. He therefore supported the call for a discussion of initiatives that Members might take to ensure continued and effective transparency in the area. He also acknowledged the technical skills and knowledge that resided in the CRTA. He was aware that the CTD would not be able to take conclusive decisions on the issue immediately. However, the issue merited further attention in the coming months and at the next meeting of the CTD. He said that the implications that a general debate on notification requirements would have on individual, already concluded RTAs was an aspect that needed to be addressed.","WTCOMTDM44.pdf","European, Communities, United, States, CTD, CTD, Members, CRTA, CTD, CTD"
"4701",4701,"109","109.     The representative of Egypt said that his delegation supported the statement made by the representative of India. He said that his delegation was of the view that the Enabling Clause should not be treated in the same way as Article XXIV of GATT 1994. The difference was clear in that that Article XXIV required the passage of an RTA through some kind of an examination and WT/COMTD/M/44 Page 32 consultations. The Enabling Clause, recognizing the burden and the cost that such an examination might have on developing countries, did not provide for that type of exercise. All it required, as mentioned by the representative of India, was that the developing country parties to an agreement promptly notify it. No examination should be carried out, either in the CTD or in the CRTA. The CTD should only take note of the agreement, as long as it was consistent with the Enabling Clause.","WTCOMTDM44.pdf","Egypt, India, GATT, RTA, India, CTD, CRTA, CTD"
"4702",4702,"11","11.      He went on to speak about the manufacture of apparel. If yarns and fabric made in any of the more than 100 countries eligible for Canadian GSP treatment were sent to an LDC and manufactured into an apparel product, the Government of Canada only required that 25 per cent of the value added be produced in the LDC for the product to receive duty and quota-free treatment into Canada. A number of other GSP schemes had 50 per cent value-added requirements for similar imports. The Government of Canada was of the view that a requirement of 50 per cent was too high and might not generate sufficient trade amongst the LDCs. The Government of Canada had, along with its own analysis, used work carried out by UNCTAD when examining the value added in apparel. It had found that the lowest value-added producer identified, which was Senegal, produced a value-added of 27 per cent while some countries produced up to 40 per cent of the value added. The Government of Canada had thus decided to use 25 per cent as a threshold in order to ensure that it was below the lowest value added of any LDC. That would ensure that all LDCs had a genuine opportunity to benefit from the Canadian initiative. What was required was that the product be sewn or assembled in the LDC. The Government of Canada did not wish to have products produced in other developing countries shipped to LDCs for a label to be sewn on and then shipped to Canada, as that did not generate any real economic activity in the LDC. The intention was to generate real economic growth in the LDCs, while at the same time ensure that other developing countries had the opportunity to benefit from the new initiative. The idea of limiting the beneficiaries to developing countries was to encourage South-South trade and the reduction of barriers between developing countries and LDCs. As the LDCs did not produce textiles, the textiles had to come from other developing countries. All developing countries could thus benefit from the new initiative if they were prepared to trade among themselves.","WTCOMTDM44.pdf","GSP, Canada, LDC, Canada, GSP, Canada, Canada, UNCTAD, Senegal, Canada, LDCs, Canada, Canada, LDCs"
"4703",4703,"110","110.    The Chairman recalled that, when the issue had been discussed in 2002 at the 43rd Session of the CTD, the Secretariat had provided a clarification regarding the notification obligations for RTAs among developing countries. What the Secretariat had said was that Members had to indicate under which legal cover they notified their RTAs. The WTO body receiving such notifications would then decide where it would go, i.e. whether it should be referred to the CRTA or not. There were two elements to the issues raised by delegations. The first related to the procedure the CTD should follow for RTAs notified under the Enabling Clause. The other element related to specific RTAs that had already been notified. His personal inclination with respect to the second element was that, once an RTA had been taken note of in the CTD, Members should be careful in going back to the matter. With respect to the first element regarding the procedure for dealing with RTAs, he suggested that the CTD seek a legal opinion from the Secretariat and keep the item on the agenda and revert to it at the next meeting.","WTCOMTDM44.pdf","Chairman, CTD, Secretariat, Secretariat, Members, WTO, CRTA, CTD, RTA, CTD, Members, CTD, Secretariat"

"4711",4711,"12","12.      He finally said that, as the new initiative touched the two sensitive sectors of textiles and apparel, the Government of Canada had to ensure that domestic Canadian interests were adequately taken into account. One other condition for eligibility for duty and quota-free treatment in textiles and apparel was therefore that each LDC sign a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with the Government of Canada. That MoU only required that LDC authorities enable the Canada Customs and Revenue Agency to verify that a product actually qualifies as originating under the LDC initiative when the Canada Customs and Revenue Agency wished to carry out such a verification. The LDC Governments were not required to do anything else than cooperate by allowing Canadian inspectors to visit the LDCs to verify that countries claiming benefits were entitled to them. The Government of Canada intended to enforce that verification strictly as there was scope for false claiming. Any shipment identified as not qualified would immediately be stopped. It was therefore in the interests of all LDC Governments to ensure that their manufacturers were aware of that rule and would cooperate with the Canadian authorities.","WTCOMTDM44.pdf","Canada, LDC, Canada, Canada, Customs, and, Revenue, Agency, Canada, Customs, and, Revenue, Agency, Canada"

"4713",4713,"14","14.      The representative of Bangladesh, speaking on behalf of the LDCs, said that his delegation subscribed to the view that enhanced trade contributed to poverty reduction. On behalf of the LDC Group of countries he extended his gratitude to the Government of Canada for its initiative to provide duty and quota-free access to essentially all imports from LDCs. The new initiative, which had actually been effective from 1 January 2003, added 903 tariff lines to the duty-free tariff items for LDCs. The improved preferential scheme included a wide range of agricultural, textiles, apparel and footwear products. Those products were of critical importance to the LDCs and accounted for a major share of their export earnings. LDCs had been requesting duty and quota-free treatment for their products with relaxed and flexible rules of origin. In fact, enhanced market access through reduced or zero-tariffs was meaningless if access was denied because of non-tariff barriers. He was particularly happy to see that the new measure was accompanied by relaxed rules of origin requirements. The initiative taken by the Canadian Authorities clearly demonstrated the Canadian Government's commitment to the Doha Ministerial Declaration in which Ministers had committed themselves to consider additional measures for progressive market access improvements for LDCs. Meaningful integration of LDCs into the Multilateral Trading System required efforts by all WTO Members. The measures taken by the Government of Canada would encourage other Members to make further improvements to their preferential schemes for LDCs, and thereby fulfill the mandate of the Doha Ministerial Declaration. Measures such as that of the Government of Canada could help arrest the increasing marginalization of the LDCs in international trade. Trade with the Quad countries accounted for more than two-thirds of LDC trade. Canada was thus an important destination for LDC exports. He said that he hoped that the opportunities provided through the new initiative would further boost LDCs' exports to Canada and accelerate economic growth in LDCs. The LDCs looked forward to enhanced cooperation with the Government of Canada.","WTCOMTDM44.pdf","Bangladesh, LDCs, LDC, Group, Canada, LDCs, LDCs, WTO, Members, Canada, Members, Canada, LDC, Canada, Canada, LDCs, Canada"

He also thanked other WTO Members who had taken similar initiatives and hoped that other Members would follow. Following LDCs' experiences with similar initiatives, he said that it would be desirable for the Government of Canada to consider practical measures, in coordination with the potential beneficiaries, which would enhance the usefulness of the new initiative. Such measures could for example include information sessions in the LDC capitals with the Canadian commercial missions to further explain the new measures. It could also include, within one or two years, an evaluation of the real impact of the initiative on bilateral trade. That would be an essential measure of the effectiveness of the initiative and would indicate any obstacles to its use.","WTCOMTDM44.pdf","Mauritania, Canada, WTO, Members, Members, Government, of, Canada, LDC"

One of the most important elements that the Government of Canada had decided to grapple with in its new initiative was the South-South component.

"4724",4724,"24","24.      The representative of Canada said that Members' interventions had encouraged his delegation to believe that the initiative was a step in the right direction on what was a long road for all Members. The Government of Canada had been inspired by the initiatives taken by the Governments of the European Communities, the United States and other members' Governments. The Government of Canada had attempted to go even further than those initiatives. Although an initiative could not be judged by only two months of existence, he said that the import statistics of the apparel sector in Canada showed that, in the first two months of 2003 since the initiative came into effect, imports from the LDCs had increased by 16 per cent. That was a positive growth rate. The overall rise in apparel imports into the Canadian market was less than 4 per cent. LDC exports were thus growing four times that rate. That was a sign that the new initiative had the potential to produce good results. The representative of Ethiopia had raised the important point of safeguarding margins of preferences. That had to be carefully considered from a trade-policy perspective. If WTO Members always had to ensure that the current margins of preferences were kept they would never be able to put their tariffs at zero. What had to be done was to find other ways to encourage economic development, and that was exactly what the Government of Canada had attempted to do by introducing the new initiative.

There had even been suggestions to limit the initiative to African beneficiaries following the G8 initiatives for Africa. The proponents of that view had said that there was very little trade between Canada and Africa. Other opponents had claimed that there was no point in taking such an initiative as the quotas would be removed in 2005 as a result of the conclusion of the Doha Round of negotiations. The Government of Canada had nevertheless decided that it was better to take the initiative before the quotas were removed to see if any country could benefit from the initiative in the meantime and possibly even establish itself in the Canadian market. The Government of Canada had also decided to keep the initiative in the WTO context, consistent with the Enabling Clause. However, what was even more important were stable environments in the LDCs, which would encourage investment and open markets, consistent with their own economic needs and social development. The Doha Development Agenda was a fundamental agenda for all Members. All Members needed to work hard to ensure that the Cancún Ministerial Conference became a success.","WTCOMTDM44.pdf","Canada, Members, Members, Canada, European, Communities, United, States, Canada, Canada, LDCs, Ethiopia, WTO, Members, Canada, Canada, Africa, Canada, Africa, Canada, Canada, WTO, Doha, Development, Agenda, Members, Members, Cancún, Ministerial, Conference"

That commitment, as far as the Secretariat had understood it, related to a desire to get a full picture of the implementation of technical TA activities carried out in 2002. That information had been compiled in document WT/COMTD/W/101/Add.4, which had been circulated to Members prior to the meeting.","WTCOMTDM44.pdf","Secretariat, Ali, Rana, Chairman, Secretariat, Secretariat, Members, Secretariat, Secretariat, Secretariat, Members"
"4730",4730,"3","3.       The Chairman recalled that, at previous sessions of the CTD, there had been agreement to invite the following intergovernmental organizations on an ad hoc, meeting-by-meeting basis: the Arab Maghreb Union (AMU), the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS), the Economic Cooperation Organisation (ECO), the Inter-Arab Investment Guarantee Corporation, the Islamic Development Bank (IDB), the Organisation of African Unity (OAU), Organisation of the Islamic Conference (OIC), the South Centre, the South Pacific Forum, the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), the West African Economic and Monetary Union (WAEMU), and the World Intellectual Property Organisation (WIPO). He proposed that, in accordance with CTD procedures, those organisations be invited to the next formal meeting of the CTD.","WTCOMTDM44.pdf","Chairman, CTD, Economic, Community, of, West, ECOWAS, Economic, Cooperation, Organisation, Inter-Arab, Investment, Guarantee, Corporation, Islamic, Development, Bank, IDB, Organisation, of, African, Unity, OAU, Islamic, Conference, OIC, South, Centre, South, Pacific, Forum, United, Nations, Environment, Programme, UNEP, West, African, Economic, and, Monetary, Union, WAEMU, World, Intellectual, Property, Organisation, WIPO, CTD"
"4731",4731,"30","30.     The Secretariat (Mr. Paul Rolian, Director, Technical Cooperation Division) said that document WT/COMTD/W/101/Add.4 summarized the implementation of TA in 2002. The Secretariat had delivered the largest number of TA activities ever in 2002, i.e. 488 activities, of which 481 had been executed in 2002 and seven in 2003 as roll-over activities. Considerable progress had, WT/COMTD/M/44 Page 8 at the same time, been made in the planning and programming process of the executed activities, since the Secretariat could report an average of 92 per cent implementation of the 2002 TA Plan (90 per cent for national activities and 95 per cent for regional activities). That implementation rate was also the result of the natural evolution of the 2002 TA Plan throughout the year, since, as reported at the 43rd Session of the Committee held in November 2002, 122 activities provided for in the 2002 TA Plan had to be cancelled for a variety of reasons, including cancellation by recipient countries; problems in joint delivery with other Agencies (in particular with respect to the Integrated Framework (IF) and mainstreaming activities); not enough progress to justify the execution of the planned activity (which concerned in particular accessions, negotiating groups, trade negotiation skills); and civil unrest/insecurity. After deducting those activities and the nine entries in the 2002 TA Plan related to the development of tools for TA, the total number of activities in the 2002 TA Plan was","WTCOMTDM44.pdf","Secretariat, Paul, Rolian, Director, Technical, Cooperation, Division, Secretariat, Secretariat, Committee"
"4732",4732,"31","31.      The representative of the United States said that her delegation noted that the Secretariat planned to provide Members with an evaluation of the 2002 TA Plan in late March 2003. She asked if that was the evaluation referred to in the commitments made by the Secretariat. Her delegation was deeply interested in that evaluation. In the preparations for the 2003 TA Plan there had been a growing sense that Members needed to consider the quality of the activities from the perspective of the beneficiaries, rather than exclusively concentrate on quantity.                        Document WT/COMTD/W/101/Add.4 was useful in terms of defining the scope of the activities, where activities had taken place, and the type of activity delivered. However, she requested the Secretariat to comment on how Members could get a policy assessment of where the greatest utility was found by the beneficiaries and where the beneficiaries thought that there were deficiencies. That type of information would be useful as Members began to consider guidelines for 2004. Her delegation would appreciate if some information on the lessons learned could be included in the periodic reporting on the implementation of the 2003 TA Plan so that those lessons could be incorporated when Members considered the 2004 TA Plan.","WTCOMTDM44.pdf","United, States, Secretariat, Members, Secretariat, Members, Secretariat, Members, Members, Members"
"4733",4733,"32","32.      The Chairman said that the Secretariat had made seven commitments. The first was to provide detailed information on activities carried out in 2002 before the end of February 2003. Document WT/COMTD/W/101/Add.4, which had just been presented to Members, aimed at responding to that commitment. The second commitment was to provide a full evaluation of the activities carried out in 2002, by March 2003. The third commitment was to produce quarterly reports on activities during 2003. The fourth commitment was to produce a structured plan on how to increase outsourcing to other multilateral institutions. The fifth commitment was to review, together with Members, the underlying terms of reference of the Doha Development Agenda Global Trust Fund (DDAGTF), including issues of access to the Fund and its management. The sixth commitment was to circulate an information note on the Trade Clinics and further consult with Members on their modalities. The final commitment was to accommodate the suggestion for small island countries in the Pacific to also be considered as countries from a region constituting a special challenge along with those countries already referred to as such in the draft 2003 TA Plan (WT/COMTD/W/104/Rev.1). As there was an overlap between some of those commitments he suggested that the Secretariat might wish to report on the other commitments as well.

"4734",4734,"33","33.      The Secretariat (DDG Dr. Ali Rana) said that the second commitment also related to the implementation of the 2002 activities. However, in addition to the figures on the activities implemented, Members had also requested the Secretariat to provide a full evaluation of the activities carried out in 2002, by March 2003. In keeping with that undertaking, the Secretariat was preparing the Technical Cooperation Audit Report for 2002, which would be circulated to Members before the end of March 2003. That paper could then be considered at the next meeting of the Committee. Regarding the third commitment, to produce quarterly reports on activities to be carried out in 2003, it was the Secretariat's intention to circulate the first such report by mid-April to cover the first quarter in its entirety. The fourth commitment was to produce a structured plan on how to increase outsourcing to other multilateral institutions. The Secretariat would provide a progress report on the ongoing work undertaken by the Secretariat to consider the possibility of outsourcing technical cooperation activities and to consider preliminary elements of a structured plan on how to increase outsourcing by the use of outside consultants and cooperation with other multilateral institutions. With the ever-increasing demand for technical cooperation activities and the limited resources available during the Doha Development Agenda negotiations, the WTO Secretariat would have to find an adequate balance between time spent on technical cooperation as compared to time devoted to other core activities, such as servicing committees and negotiations in particular. The reports prepared by the Secretariat's 1998 Task Force on Enhanced WTO Technical Cooperation and the 2000 Task Force on Technical Cooperation and Training respectively, were useful starting points for that process which would also build on consultations with interested parties (IGO, academics, former staff and former trade diplomats), before being submitted for Members' consideration in the CTD. As a resource base, outside consultants would constitute a reservoir to which the WTO Secretariat could have recourse to supplement its own limited human resources for technical cooperation/training activities. They would all have to fit carefully constructed profiles in order to be useful in complementing in-house human resources for technical cooperation activities. At the same time, increasing recourse to outside consultants was probably inevitable since the Director-General's recent proposal on increased human resources had met with limited success in the budget process. While the Secretariat had requested 46 new posts in 2003, Members had only agreed to six. The terms of reference of the establishment for the DDAGTF clearly indicated that the Fund could be used for TA activities to be conducted by outside experts if it was deemed necessary. That implied that the Secretariat was fully responsible for the co-ordination and execution of all subcontracted activities.","WTCOMTDM44.pdf","Secretariat, Ali, Rana, Members, Secretariat, Secretariat, Members, Committee, Secretariat, Secretariat, Secretariat, WTO, Secretariat, Secretariat, WTO, Technical, Cooperation, Task, Force, on, Technical, Cooperation, IGO, Members, CTD, WTO, Secretariat, Director-General, Secretariat, Members, Secretariat"
"4735",4735,"34","34.      The Secretariat went on to provide some statistics regarding the recent practice of outsourcing. The Secretariat had used outside consultants sparingly in the past two years. Nineteen consultants had been used in 2001 for around 40 assignments dealing with 25 technical cooperation and training activities. In 2002, 28 consultants had been used for just over 30 assignments. Those consultants had been drawn from several sources, and included former WTO Secretariat staff, former Ambassadors and academics. Their compensation involved the payment of an honorarium comprising either a fee of CHF 600 per day or a lump sum per assignment negotiated with the WTO division involved. The payment of daily subsistence allowance (DSA) was not automatic, and travel expenses were paid when appropriate. In some cases, only DSA and travel expenses were paid, and the honorarium was waived. As part of the consideration of outsourcing, the Secretariat had drawn up a roster of experts in 2002 on the basis of indications provided by the Membership of names of individuals and their areas of expertise. That roster was being updated and expanded by the Training Institute, with contributions from all divisions, to take account of recent WTO experience in outsourcing to outside consultants. One way to improve the current procedure for hiring outside consultants would be to devise a more elaborate, open and transparent process. Guidelines might be required for establishing a roster of experts and procedures for selecting resource persons, as well as for the proper management of such a roster. The guidelines would also govern overall legal and administrative provisions with regard to the use of outside experts as well as related financial aspects, including consultancy fees, DSA, insurance coverage and travel expenses. The guidelines could also contain provisions regarding an overall assessment of experiences with regard to outsourcing and a related cost/benefit assessment. Such an assessment would also allow for a further refinement of WT/COMTD/M/44 Page 10 relevant provisions, where required. Experts to be considered for inclusion in the roster could include former trade policy officials, former GATT/WTO staff Members, academics, recognised experts in a specific field, trainers, and officials from other international organizations and recognised bodies.","WTCOMTDM44.pdf","Secretariat, Secretariat, WTO, Secretariat, WTO, DSA, DSA, Secretariat, Training, Institute, WTO, DSA, GATT/WTO, Members"
"4736",4736,"35","35.      He further said that one focus in the work on outsourcing had been on the WTO's relationship with partner institutions. The Secretariat's current policy was reflected in a note on ""Inter-Agency Cooperation: State-of-Play"" dated July 2002 (WT/COMTD/W/102) and in the 2003 Coordinated WTO Secretariat Annual TA Plan (WT/COMTD/W/104/Rev.2). The Secretariat's policy underlined that inter-agency arrangements and strategic partnerships were essential in order to respond fully to the significant technical cooperation mandates in the Doha Ministerial Declaration. Those arrangements were also necessary in areas outside the strict competence of the WTO. The Secretariat had endeavoured over the past 18 months to develop and formalize its cooperation with different partners at the regional and international level in order to respond adequately to the Doha Development Agenda Mandates. That cooperation was generally embodied in MoUs. The Secretariat had also engaged in reformulating existing MoUs to render them relevant to the Doha Development Agenda. In negotiating MoUs or other such arrangements, financing arrangements and cost-sharing ratios had always been a sensitive issue. To date, the Secretariat had insisted on negotiating appropriate cost-sharing arrangements with partners to finance jointly organized activities. The Secretariat was also attentive to the need to preserve the integrity of WTO Members’ negotiating positions. When policy differences arose in negotiations with other institutions, partnerships for capacity building activities were limited to areas of agreement. However, there was need for a clearer policy on the issue, as the MoUs signed with that large network of organisations, agencies and banks were still far from being harmonized. The Secretariat was in the process of preparing a set of guidelines to allow for a more coherent approach to WTO partnerships, whether in terms of financing, capacity building, or sharing of expertise. That would allow the WTO to present its potential partners with one or two standard agreements to serve as a basis for negotiations. The Secretariat had developed standard DDAGTF agreements for Members' funding. The most recent MoUs signed with other organisations fell mainly into two categories. The first was texts where the two parties merely expressed their wish to cooperate in general or on specific matters, but where it was clear that there was no intention to enter into concrete engagements immediately. Such MoUs generally left it to future ""implementing agreements"" to define the precise areas of cooperation and the nature of that cooperation on a case-by-case basis. The second category of MoUs were ""Framework agreements"", where the two parties expressed their wish to co-operate in general or on specific matters and set out the terms of their cooperation in such a way that most of the issues that would be recurrent in the course of the implementation of the framework agreements (e.g., financial arrangements, administrative issues, etc.) were dealt with, leaving only a limited number of questions specific to an activity, to be addressed in each particular case. There was actually a third category of MoUs signed by the WTO earlier, including with the IMF, the World Bank and the World Customs Organization. Those were mandated by the provisions of the WTO agreements, and their negotiation and approval involved WTO Members directly. They each had a format of their own as a result.","WTCOMTDM44.pdf","WTO, Secretariat, WTO, Secretariat, Secretariat, WTO, Secretariat, Doha, Development, Agenda, Mandates, Secretariat, Doha, Development, Agenda, Secretariat, Secretariat, WTO, Members, MoUs, Secretariat, WTO, WTO, Secretariat, Members, MoUs, MoUs, MoUs, MoUs, WTO, IMF, World, Bank, World, Customs, Organization, WTO, WTO, Members"
"4737",4737,"36","36.      The Secretariat further provided Members with some elements for an initial discussion in the Committee on the fifth commitment, which was to review, together with Members, the underlying terms of reference of the DDAGTF, including issues of access to the Fund and its management. He started by referring to Annex B of document WT/BFA/56 of 18 December 2001 of the Committee on Budget, Finance and Administration (the Budget Committee). That Annex reported on the deliberations of Members in the Budget Committee and provided some guidance on the operation of the DDAGTF. The Secretariat was guided by what Members had asked it to do. He recalled that it was clearly stated in that document that the purpose of the DDAGTF was to finance technical assistance to developing countries and/or economies in transition, and especially LDCs, in accordance with the commitments made in the Doha Ministerial Declaration and the agreed Co-ordinated WTO Secretariat Annual TA Plan, or responding to the criteria specified in the New WTO Strategy for Technical Cooperation. Access to the Fund should be provided to: LDCs, developing countries, and economies in transition, and to non-residents. Areas and activities to be funded included:                                                                                      WT/COMTD/M/44                                                                                             Page 11 commitments made in the Doha Declaration, activities contained in the TA Plan, activities identified in the Strategy for Technical Cooperation, ""trade policy clinics"" and other activities requested by Members, Geneva based activities, including the Geneva week, or TA activities that were held in Geneva back to back with regular WTO meetings. With respect to cost, the DDAGTF was used to cover all costs related to the effective functioning of the activity, including local administrative costs and costs for simultaneous interpretation for regional seminars, if deemed necessary. The DDAGTF was presently managed by the Technical Co-operation Division (TCD) and the Administration and General Services Division (AGSD), who reported to the Budget Committee in accordance with established financial rules and regulations.","WTCOMTDM44.pdf","Secretariat, Members, Committee, Members, Committee, on, Budget, ,, Finance, and, Administration, Budget, Committee, Members, Budget, Committee, Secretariat, Members, WTO, Secretariat, WTO, Strategy, for, Technical, Cooperation, Members, Geneva, Geneva, Geneva, WTO, Technical, Co-operation, Division, General, Services, Division, AGSD, Budget, Committee"
"4738",4738,"37","37.      He continued by saying that the sixth commitment made by the Secretariat in connection with the 2003 TA Plan was to circulate an information note on ""Trade Clinics"" and further consult with Members on their modalities. The Secretariat was in the process of elaborating the concept of ""trade clinics"". The Director-General had introduced the idea of establishing ""trade clinics"" to assist Members address particular problems. The Director-General had a precise idea of the direction he wished the initiative to take. First, the Secretariat had refined the scope of the initiative from ""trade clinics"" to ""trade policy clinics"". The purpose of the trade policy clinics was to provide Members with a one-stop service to answer urgent questions concerning their trade policies and practices. A Member seeking that service would receive a diagnosis of the trade issues of concern to it and practical recommendations on how they might be addressed. It was envisaged that the clinics would help fill in any gap in planned TA activities, and help answer the types of questions that were not covered by present WTO activities. It would also provide the Secretariat with a mechanism to respond quickly and flexibly to urgent TA needs over the course of the year. Second, there would be a coherent link between the trade policy clinics and the existing technical assistance and capacity building activities. There were already numerous activities that addressed some of the concerns. The clinics would help avoid duplication and optimise the use of scarce Secretariat resources. In addition, as part of a coherent framework for technical cooperation and capacity building, the results of the trade policy clinics would feed back into the regular WTO technical assistance programme and help ensure that WTO activities were well targeted and meaningful. Third, related to the point on coherence, the Secretariat already had experience in evaluating trade policies and practises, particularly through Trade Policy Reviews. The trade policy clinics would utilise that expertise and, as far as possible, build synergies with the Trade Policy Reviews. That was already happening in some cases. The Trade Policy Review Division continued to receive requests from Members to discuss the results of their TPRs. The clinics could help coordinate, systematize and extend that growing demand for Secretariat expertise in diagnostic and prescriptive trade policy work.","WTCOMTDM44.pdf","Secretariat, Members, Secretariat, Director-General, Members, Director-General, Secretariat, Members, Member, WTO, Secretariat, Secretariat, WTO, WTO, Secretariat, Trade, Policy, Review, Division, Members, Secretariat"
"4739",4739,"38","38.      Fourth, he said that the clinics would be light in administrative design, flexible and quick to react to the needs of Members. The Secretariat did not intend to create another layer of technical assistance. Existing Secretariat mechanisms should be used, to the extent possible, to coordinate, administer and deliver trade policy clinics. Fifth, the clinics would mainly be about diagnosis and prescription. Upon request, a trade policy clinic would study the problem/s identified by the Member and provide a diagnosis of what needed to be done. In other words, trade policy clinics would be an important preliminary component of a technical assistance programme. In that regard, the trade policy clinics should not be viewed as a stand-alone product but as an integral part of the WTO technical assistance and capacity building programme. Sixth, the Secretariat expected trade policy clinics to involve, not only the WTO Secretariat, but also other international organisations which might have particular expertise relevant to the needs of the Member in question. For example, if a Member requested expertise on customs or intellectual property-related matters, the delegation to address such concerns could comprise staff from the World Customs Organization (WCO) or the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) or related bodies. That would be an important opportunity to build coherence with other international organisations and mobilise their resources and knowledge. Seventh, in light of the constraints on Secretariat resources some prioritisation of the beneficiaries of the trade policy clinics would be required. The Secretariat would be guided by the Members in that respect. In addition, the Secretariat could only respond positively to a request to WT/COMTD/M/44 Page 12 establish a trade policy clinic, if it had the resources to do so. In that regard, it might be productive to consider a regional approach to the clinics, particularly in cases where several countries in a region shared similar problems or concerns. There were clearly a number of practical and operational questions that would need to be answered. The Secretariat hoped to be able to circulate an information note on the trade policy clinics in the near future. He said that it would be useful at that stage to hear Members' preliminary views on those ideas, as that input would help the Secretariat shape the initiative and ensure that it effectively met the needs of the Members.","WTCOMTDM44.pdf","Members, Secretariat, Secretariat, Member, WTO, Secretariat, WTO, Secretariat, Member, Member, World, Customs, Organization, WCO, World, Intellectual, Property, Organization, WIPO, Secretariat, Secretariat, Members, Secretariat, Secretariat, Members, Secretariat, Members"

Furthermore, a total of 134 ad hoc activities had been carried out in 2002, which, in terms of the number of activities undertaken, represented 27 per cent of the 488 activities undertaken in 2002. In terms of cost however, those activities represented less than half that percentage since, in most instances, the only costs incurred were those related to the participation of WTO staff. Table I of document WT/COMTD/W/101/Add.4 contained a breakdown of activities by region and table II a breakdown of activities by subject matter. In that context, he said that the Secretariat had made every effort to implement the priorities set by Members, both in terms of regions and in terms of subjects, without prejudice to the global coverage of its TA activities. With respect to the implementation of Members' commitments on technical cooperation and capacity building contained in the Doha Ministerial Declaration, he recalled the Director-General's interim report (WT/GC/W/484) to the General Council in December 2002, in pursuance of the mandate contained in paragraph 41 of the Doha Ministerial Declaration.","WTCOMTDM44.pdf","WTO, Secretariat, Members, Members, Director-General, General, Council"
"4741",4741,"39","39.     The Secretariat went on to the seventh and final commitment made by the Secretariat in connection with the 2003 TA Plan which was to accommodate the suggestion for small island countries in the Pacific to also be considered as countries from a region constituting a special challenge along with other countries already referred to as such in the draft 2003 TA Plan (WT/COMTD/W/104/Rev.1). That request had been made by the delegations of Australia and New Zealand. The Secretariat had accommodated that request in the second revision of the 2003 TA Plan, dated 10 December 2002 (WT/COMTD/W/104/Rev.2). The specific revision was contained in Chapter X, Section D, paragraph 42 on page 17 of the English version.","WTCOMTDM44.pdf","Secretariat, Secretariat, Pacific, Australia, New, Zealand, Secretariat"

"4743",4743,"40","40.      The representative of Djibouti said that his Government had benefited from TA since 1998/1999 when the first French regional seminars had been held. Since then, one or two seminars had been organized each year. His Government had thus benefited from both regional and national events. A seminar had been held a few weeks earlier on trade and investment in cooperation with UNCTAD. That seminar had been a real success and the Minister of Trade of Djibouti had addressed a letter of congratulations to the Director-General. The two organizations had complemented each other well and the participants in that activity had written a joint communiqué requesting that that type of seminar be held on a regular basis. The Government of Djibouti had both attempted to evaluate its needs and follow-up to the training provided. He asked what new elements Members were looking for in terms of follow-up and evaluation. He asked whether there would be new methods or a new team of staff. It became increasingly difficult to provide technical assistance as the themes discussed within the WTO broadened. When the WTO had come into existence a certain number of activities had been carried out per year. However, the number of activities had increased many times since then. There had to be realistic expectations on WTO TA activities. Many of the WTO staff Members knew the problems and needs of the developing country WTO Members. It was nevertheless important that the WTO Secretariat collaborated with other organisations which had more experience than the WTO in certain areas. Collaboration with other agencies would complement the knowledge of WTO staff. He knew of successful collaboration between the WTO and ITC, UNCTAD and the World Customs Organization. If the Secretariat considered changes to its delivery of technical assistance, such changes would therefore have to be well thought through.","WTCOMTDM44.pdf","Djibouti, UNCTAD, Djibouti, Director-General, Djibouti, Members, WTO, WTO, WTO, WTO, Members, WTO, Members, WTO, Secretariat, WTO, WTO, WTO, ITC, UNCTAD, World, Customs, Organization, Secretariat"
"4744",4744,"41","41.      The representative of Senegal said that his delegation continued to believe that TA was at the heart of the Doha Development Agenda. The issue of TA therefore merited Members' attention. The had presented new ideas for TA which his delegation hoped would be put into practice. He said that he had a question with respect to the trade policy clinics and their relationship to the Trade Policy Reviews. He asked if the idea was that the trade policy clinics would complement the Trade Policy Reviews if the Trade Policy Reviews revealed deficiencies in the trade policies of developing countries, or, whether the trade policy clinics were something distinct from, but parallel to, the Trade Policy Reviews. If so, he asked if developing countries Members would have to request trade policy clinics in particular sectors. All Members were concerned that duplication had to be avoided and that the available resources were concentrated in the most important areas. There had been needs assessments in areas such as technical barriers to trade and almost all developing countries had responded. If the idea of trade policy clinics was to be upheld, he suggested that it would make operational sense to begin in an area such as technical barriers to trade where practically every developing country Member encountered difficulties. He asked whether it would be possible to consider the needs assessment of each developing country Government and attempt to respond to the needs expressed. He had been told that the WTO Secretariat would attempt to guide Members                                                                                     WT/COMTD/M/44                                                                                            Page 13 towards different other international organizations depending on the types of needs Governments identified. However, Members knew that there were coordination and follow-up problems in developing countries.","WTCOMTDM44.pdf","Senegal, Doha, Development, Agenda, Members, Members, Members, Member, WTO, Secretariat, Members, Members"
"4745",4745,"42","42.      The representative of Canada said that the her delegation was pleased to see that the Secretariat had been able to deliver on 92 per cent of the planned activities. That was an impressive percentage given that the delivery of TA was additional to other roles the Secretariat had to play. Her delegation was awaiting the document on trade policy clinics in order to review that initiative more closely before commenting on it. She asked what percentage of requests for TA the Secretariat had fulfilled in 2002. Her delegation regretted that the report had neither provided the costing nor an indication of the human resource requirements for the delivery of the activities. She therefore asked whether that information would be included in the evaluation by the Technical Cooperation Audit which her delegation was eager to receive. She asked how many of the ad hoc activities delivered in 2002 that had been identified as needs by the developing country Members. She noted that some countries and regions had received ad hoc activities although all their planned activities had been delivered. That was true for certain categories of TA. Her delegation therefore hoped that the Secretariat could ensure a proper balance when accepting ad hoc requests in the future. With respect to outsourcing her delegation recognized that the additional stress on the Secretariat's human resources and encouraged the Secretariat to continue to actively seek alternatives in the delivery of future TA in order for it to better concentrate on its own mandate and in order for Secretariat staff not to face undue hardship with respect to their workload. In order to properly track the fulfilment of the Doha Ministerial commitments on TA and capacity building, her delegation encouraged the use of the categories used in the trade-related TA and capacity building database in the TA reports.","WTCOMTDM44.pdf","Canada, Secretariat, Secretariat, Secretariat, Members, Secretariat, Secretariat, Secretariat, TA, Secretariat"
"4746",4746,"43","43.      The representative of Barbados welcomed the creativeness that the Secretariat had shown to ensure successful delivery of the 2003 and future TA Plans. Because TA was of primary importance to her Government and a necessary tool for developing country Members, her delegation welcomed the possibility of increased use of outside consultants. Her delegation recognized the challenges of having consultants from outside the WTO deliver a message from the WTO. Nevertheless, it was important to attempt to respond to as many TA needs as possible. She therefore encouraged the Secretariat to elaborate ways to source competent experts. Her delegation was interested in having a closer look at the guidelines that the Secretariat was elaborating. Whatever criteria used for the identification of consultants, it should include the consideration of regional experts. There was an interesting linkage between identification of regional consultants and the initiative carried out by the WTO Training Institute to create relationships with regional academic institutions. The WTO Secretariat would become more familiar with regional experts through a strengthening of those relationships. She urged the Secretariat to continue to consider experts outside the ambit of former staff members and former Ambassadors as Members who had not had their nationals serve as regular WTO Secretariat staff would otherwise be at a disadvantage. Her delegation believed that the trade policy clinics seemed to be useful. It was necessary to maintain the flexible nature of the initiative. Concerns had previously been expressed from within the Secretariat and by some Members about the number of ad hoc activities. Her delegation had nevertheless expressed the view that there was a need for a certain amount of flexibility. She said that she looked forward to more information about the trade policy clinics, and especially on how they would be requested and to what extent they would influence the Secretariat's assessment of Member's TA requests. She asked whether there would be a formal linkage between the trade policy clinics and Member's TA requests and said that, if that was the case, there should be a more widespread use of the trade policy clinics. She welcomed the Secretariat's decision to accommodate the request made by the delegations of Australia and New Zealand for a recognition of the small island states of the Pacific as a region with special challenges. The Caribbean had also rightly been recognized as such a region. That recognition for the small island states of the Pacific was welcome as small island developing states had special needs and specific vulnerabilities which required focussed responses. Such sensitisation among the Secretariat and Members was necessary.

The representative of the United States said that her delegation welcomed the suggestion made by the representative of Canada that it would be useful for Members if future documentation could provide more information on the human as well as the financial resources used in implementing the TA Plans. She was aware of the fact that the Budget Committee had received information on the budgetary aspects. However, having information on both the budgetary and the human resources used would help Members understand the WTO TA requirements. She said that her delegation was interested in outsourcing as it was concerned about the ability of the Secretariat to deliver effectively on the large number of activities foreseen during 2003. The implementation of the 2003 Programme had begun late as it had taken time for Members to agree to the 2003 TA Plan. During the preparations of the 2003 TA Plan, delegations had known that some time would be lost in the run up to the Cancún Ministerial Conference when delegations would be preoccupied in negotiations. Outsourcing was therefore also time sensitive. The delivery of the activities planned for 2003 had to be undertaken, preferably at an accelerated pace, to enable the Secretariat to deliver on the entire 2003 TA Plan. It would be helpful to consider the use of regional expertise as suggested by the representative of Barbados. With respect to the guidelines for the DDAGTF, she said that her delegation appreciated the thoughts outlined by the Secretariat on the administrative questions such as the scope of access. However, she had not heard anything about the strategic vision and the TA priorities. She asked how Members collectively could define the key activities that met the needs of the Doha Development Round and identify, from a broader point of view, what Members' priorities were. Once that work was done, Members would have a sense of what WTO TA was meant to achieve. That would assist Members in considering future TA plans from a broader perspective, and not only respond to individual TA requests. WTO TA was at an early stage of being built up. It would therefore be useful to have a discussion on the strategic vision for WTO TA and its priorities in connection with the drawing up of the guidelines for the DDAGTF.","WTCOMTDM44.pdf","United, States, Canada, Members, Budget, Committee, Members, WTO, Secretariat, Members, Cancún, Ministerial, Conference, Secretariat, Barbados, Secretariat, Members, Members, Members, WTO, Members, WTO, WTO"
"4748",4748,"45","45.      She went on to say that her delegation was interested in the evolution of the ideas of trade policy clinics. There had been a lot of debate on what some Members thought to be an excessive number of ad hoc activities. However, that was understandable given the fact that the number of activities to be delivered had increased in 2002. The trade policy clinics could help to retain a certain amount of flexibility in the process, while at the same time ensuring that the agreed TA Plan would remain the principal focus of Members. Her delegation was concerned about how the trade policy clinics would be built into the 2003 TA Plan as they had not been budgeted for, and looked forward to hearing how the Secretariat proposed to resolve that. She asked whether it would be possible for the Secretariat to build in the qualitative aspects of TA into the quarterly reports that the Secretariat would provide. For example, she suggested that the quarterly reports include summaries of the questionnaires that the participants in activities had to fill out at the end of seminars. That would respond to questions such as whether the participants felt that the activity was useful and whether they would have preferred another mode of delivery. Building in some kind of ongoing qualitative assessment of the activities recently undertaken would be useful in order for the TA Plans to be fine- tuned while they were being implemented. She said that her last point related to new modes of delivery of TA. Some delegations had previously indicated that WTO TA delivery was too concentrated on seminars. She suggested that modern information technology be utilised more. A big network of on-line learning was available that the WTO might learn from and a component of on-line learning might be built into the WTO TA Plan. Given the resource constraints of the Secretariat, her delegation suggested that the Secretariat consider alternative approaches to TA delivery. She supported the suggestion made by the representative of Canada to integrate the TA database with the ongoing delivery of WTO TA. It was important to ensure that that database was used.","WTCOMTDM44.pdf","Members, Members, Secretariat, Secretariat, Secretariat, WTO, WTO, WTO, Secretariat, Secretariat, Canada, WTO, TA"
"4749",4749,"46","46.     The Secretariat (DDG Dr. Ali Rana) thanked Members for their useful comments and important questions which would assist the Secretariat in meeting some of the commitments undertaken. He informed the representative of Djibouti, who had asked about future TA Plans, that although the Secretariat was in the process of implementing the 2003 TA Plan, it would soon begin to consult with Members on the 2004 TA Plan to ensure an early start in the preparations for the coming year. The Secretariat would continue to consult with Members on its TA activities. He encouraged                                                                                    WT/COMTD/M/44                                                                                           Page 15 Members to send their regional representatives to such consultative meetings during which delegations could work together with the Secretariat in planning the activities to be carried out in 2004. The representative of Senegal had posed a question regarding the relationship between the trade policy reviews and the trade policy clinics. Trade policy reviews assisted Members with some of their diagnostic work since many years back. That was the type of work the trade policy clinics could also elaborate on. With respect to the request for TA in the area of technical barriers to trade, the Secretariat would be guided by Members needs. If that was one of the issues of concern to the Government of Senegal and if it submitted a request to the WTO Secretariat, such a request would be considered. The whole concept of trade policy clinics was being developed and was not yet at a stage where it had been operationalized. The Secretariat would issue a note on the trade policy clinics before the next regular meeting of the CTD. Regarding the appeal by the representatives of Canada and the United States to use the TA database, he encouraged the donors to provide more information to the database. The Secretariat was also of the view that it was an important tool for eliminating duplication and an important source of information for all Members. The more statistics provided to it, the more useful it would become.","WTCOMTDM44.pdf","Secretariat, Ali, Rana, Members, Secretariat, Djibouti, Secretariat, Members, Secretariat, Members, Members, Secretariat, Senegal, Members, Secretariat, Members, Senegal, WTO, Secretariat, Secretariat, CTD, Canada, United, States, Secretariat, Members"
"4750",4750,"47","47.      He further referred to the comments made by the representative of Barbados and said that a note on the trade policy clinics would be circulated before the next regular meeting of the CTD, after having incorporated some of the suggestions that had been made by delegations. He concurred with the importance of including regional experts and regional academic institutions when the Secretariat considered the issue of outsourcing. The regional trade policy courses being held in Africa, and soon to be held in the Caribbean and in Asia, would be one way of building regional institutional capacity. That was a first way to use regional experts. He agreed that ad hoc activities could be useful, but trade clinics were another useful and important initiative. The Secretariat would continue to be guided by Members with respect to how such clinics might be requested and how they would be applied. With respect to the strategic vision and priorities mentioned by the representative of the United States in the context of the guidelines for the DDAGTF, he said that the Secretariat would be guided by any comments made by the Members. The concept of trade policy clinics was an evolving idea, for which some key elements had been introduced and on which Members' feedback would be important for the idea to be operationalized. With respect to comments on the content of the quarterly reports he informed Members that back-to-office reports from all the activities undertaken already existed. Those were useful in terms of evaluating the individual activities. The monthly meetings of the Secretariat-wide Technical Assistance Management Committee reviewed activities and aimed at increasing coherence and improving internal Secretariat coordination in the TA delivery. The back- to-office reports also guided the WTO TA Audit. It would be useful to consider new modes of delivery as suggested by the representative of the United States. The Secretariat had access to different toolkits for negotiations. It was considering different proposals and welcomed any further proposals by Members which could improve the delivery of TA.","WTCOMTDM44.pdf","Barbados, CTD, Secretariat, Africa, Caribbean, Asia, Secretariat, Members, United, States, Secretariat, Members, Members, Members, Technical, Assistance, Management, Committee, Secretariat, WTO, TA, Audit, United, States, Secretariat, Members"
"4751",4751,"48","48.     The Secretariat (Mr. Paul Rolian, Director, Technical Cooperation Division) said that one delegation had raised the question of whether there was a way of knowing what percentage of the TA requests made for 2002 had actually been met. That was unfortunately not possible as the procedures with the 2002 TA Plan had been different from those for the 2003 TA Plan. The 2002 process had been a consultative one in which the Secretariat had received inputs from Members and Committees before producing the 2002 TA Plan. However, the Secretariat did not have a list of 2002 TA requests by Members as it had for the 2003 TA Plan. It was correct that the Budget Committee had received some documentation with respect to the TA budget. The yearly budget estimates in the Burgundy Book contained a report on the work days spent on TA by each Division. That would give Members an idea of the proportion of staff time that was spent on TA. However, the Technical Cooperation Division would attempt to put some useful information together for the delegations of the United States and Canada who had requested it. Regarding the fact that some ad hoc activities had been carried out in places where there had been full implementation of the TA requested, he said that there was no perfect correlation between the activities requested and the activities received on the one hand, and the need to carry out additional activities which could not be foreseen when the requests WT/COMTD/M/44 Page 16 were made, on the other. The Secretariat would consider how to correlate the content of the TA database with what it reported back to Members. The TA Audit had mentioned last year that it was important to have a critical mass of information in order to make a sensible assessment of the overall TA delivery. That was why the WTO TA Audit had undertaken to provide the CTD with an annual report on the TA activities carried out. However, that did not mean that the Secretariat would not take lessons learnt in the context of the activities reported on in the quarterly reports into account, or not seek Members' guidance if issues arose during the implementation.","WTCOMTDM44.pdf","Secretariat, Paul, Rolian, Director, Technical, Cooperation, Division, Secretariat, Members, Secretariat, Members, Budget, Committee, Members, Technical, Cooperation, Division, United, States, Canada, Secretariat, Members, TA, Audit, WTO, TA, Audit, CTD, Secretariat, Members"
"4752",4752,"49","49.      The representative of India said that his delegation looked forward to the full Audit of the TA activities carried out in 2002 and the note on the trade policy clinics. He said that it would be useful for Members to get the note on the trade policy clinics in advance of the next meeting of the Committee for Members to have time to study it and contribute to the initiative by the Director-General. He asked whether the Secretariat intended to circulate a draft note on outsourcing. If not, he said that it would help delegations if they could get a written copy of the ideas outlined orally by the Secretariat in order for Members to study them further and send them to their capitals. His delegation welcomed the comments made by the representative of Barbados regarding linkages with regional academic institutions in the context of the overall TA Plan and with respect to outsourcing in particular. An important element of the TA Plan was to strengthen the capacity of existing academic institutions which could provide long-term assistance to their governments and stakeholders. Various delegations had mentioned a number of points relating to the need for better delivery of the TA Plan and enhanced coordination. In that context he referred to 43rd Session of the Committee at which it had been agreed that all issues relating to technical cooperation would be considered early in 2003. It had been noted that such a consideration would not be made with the intention to micromanage WTO TA activities but rather to provide broad guidelines and to ensure that WTO TA activities met the needs of the recipient Members. His delegation hoped that Members could have such a discussion at the next meeting of the Committee while considering all the notes promised by the Secretariat on various aspects of the 2002 and 2003 TA Plans. Footnote 1 of document WT/COMTD/W/104/Add.2 on the 2003 ""Outreach Activities"" was also relevant in that context. It stated that ""Within the context of a full review of technical assistance and capacity building, a decision will be taken on the inclusion of such regional activities in technical assistance and capacity building for subsequent years."" With respect to the document containing information on the implementation of WTO TA activities in 2002 (WT/COMTD/W/101/Add.4) he said that two activities relating to investment were listed as having been held in India during the same period of time. It seemed to his delegation that that was one and the same activity. He therefore asked the Secretariat to verify that and, if necessary, issue a corresponding corrigendum.","WTCOMTDM44.pdf","India, Members, Committee, for, Members, Director-General, Secretariat, Secretariat, Members, Barbados, Committee, WTO, WTO, Members, Members, Committee, Secretariat, WTO, India, Secretariat"
"4753",4753,"5","5.      The Chairman said that, at the last few meetings, the Committee had also had before it a number of outstanding requests for observer status. They came from the League of Arab States, OPEC, the Gulf Organization for Industrial Consulting, the Organisation Internationale de la Francophonie, and from the Common Fund for Commodities. The positions of delegations were well- known and on the record. He proposed that, if there had not been any recent change in Members' positions, the Committee would revert to those requests at its next formal meeting.","WTCOMTDM44.pdf","Chairman, Committee, OPEC, Gulf, Organization, for, Industrial, Consulting, Organisation, Internationale, de, la, Francophonie, Members, Committee"
"4754",4754,"50","50.      The representative of Japan said that individual issues had been raised in the discussions on the 2003 TA Plan had been raised in order to ensure the best use of the limited resources available, without affecting the quality or the number of activities when implementing the 2003 TA Plan. His delegation therefore agreed that each activity implemented would have to be coherent with the 2003 TA Plan. Regarding the activities implemented in 2002 in cooperation with other organizations he said that document WT/COMTD/W/101/Add.4 showed that some activities had not been implemented due to a lack of resources on the part of the organization the WTO was cooperating with. That document also showed that there had been a rather high number of ad hoc activities. The Secretariat had said that the number of ad hoc activities would be reduced to within 5 per cent in 2003. He was raising that issue because his Government would be contributing to the implementation of the 2003 TA Plan in two spheres. First, it had and would be contributing to the DDAGTF. In 2002, his Government had contributed CHF 600,000. In addition to that, he said that he was pleased to announce an additional contribution by the Government of Japan CHF 210,000 to the DDAGTF. His Government therefore sought modalities by which its development agencies could cooperate with the WTO in implementing the WTO technical cooperation activities. That was the second sphere in which his Government would be contributing. However, it was a difficult one due to the different fiscal year applied in Japan. The development cooperation projects of the Government of Japan were developed with a different time frame. It was therefore difficult for his Government to incorporate its                                                                                      WT/COMTD/M/44                                                                                             Page 17 activities into the WTO TA Plans.                 One example was found on page 24 of document WT/COMTD/W/101/Add.4. At the bottom of the column there was an activity entitled ""WTO-UNCTAD-JICA Workshop on the Relationship between Trade and Investment"". JICA stood for Japan International Cooperation Agency. That activity had been categorized as an ad hoc activity. However, that activity did not change the original purpose or shape of the 2003 TA Plan. His Government had simply attempted to add its resources for WTO TA activities. The original target countries had not been changed. Although his delegation did not wish to see a high level of ad hoc activities, there was a need to make some room for such activities as they could reduce the costs borne by the Secretariat and could provide beneficiary countries with opportunities to participate in the meeting of the Working Group on the Relationship between Trade and Investment, held back-to-back with the above-mentioned workshop. He said that he wished to draw Members' attention to the positive aspects of such activities for Members to continue to arrange for such activities in the future.","WTCOMTDM44.pdf","Japan, WTO, Secretariat, Japan, WTO, WTO, Japan, Japan, WTO, JICA, Japan, International, Cooperation, Agency, WTO, Secretariat, Members, Members"
"4755",4755,"51","51.     He went on to say that the hoped that the process for establishing guidelines for outsourcing would be transparent. His delegation would comment on the guidelines when a draft note was presented to Members. Regarding the modalities of the trade policy clinics, he said that his delegation was pleased to hear that their administrative design was going to be light. However, when the Secretariat presented Members with ideas in writing he hoped that that paper would include the administrative implications of the trade policy clinics. Since many developing country Members faced difficulties in utilizing certain special and differential treatment (S&D) provisions in different agreements, he believed that the trade policy clinics might respond to questions regarding how Members might make use of S&D provisions. It was important to identify the key needs of developing countries and it might be possible to do that through the trade policy clinics. A feedback system should therefore be included in any document produced by the Secretariat. Lastly, he said that his delegation was aware of the specific difficulties faced by small island Members and that there had been a request for more countries to be considered as countries from a region constituting a special challenge. However, the formula was not important. What was important was the content and substance of the activities. Some input from the Dedicated Session on Small Economies would be necessary to identify the common needs of the Members who faced special challenges. Regional experts might also be able to provide information on the special challenges faced by those Members.","WTCOMTDM44.pdf","Members, Secretariat, Members, Members, Members, Secretariat, Members, Members, Members"
"4756",4756,"52","52.      The representative of Bangladesh said that, if statistics were an indicator of the success of any TA Plan, then there was no reason for Members to be unhappy as 90 per cent of the planned national and 95 per cent of the planned regional activities had been implemented. However, whether they had built capacity in the beneficiary countries was a different question. The information was provided by region and by subject matter. That format made it difficult to get an overview of the amount of TA provided to the LDCs. He asked what the rational of the format was and whether the Secretariat could accommodate the LDC category within that format. The listing of activities was also important to understand the kind of TA provided. It was also important for Members to understand who the lead agency was in the delivery of each particular activity. He had found at least two activities to which the WTO had been invited but for which the WTO had not been the main organizer, like the LDC Ministerial Conference in Benin and the WIPO seminar in Bangladesh. The former had been organized by the United Nations and the latter by WIPO. He said that it would assist Members if the listing of activities could be made more focused and include information regarding which activities the WTO had actually organized itself and which activities the WTO had been invited to but which mainly had been organized by other organizations. The WTO should cooperate with other agencies to facilitate the delivery of TA activities. However, 122 activities had had to be cancelled for a variety of reasons in 2002. One of the reasons mentioned was problems in the joint delivery with other agencies. That had been particularly difficult in relation to the Integrated Framework (IF). Although a different fora existed where issues related to the IF could be discussed he asked the Secretariat to inform Members about the type of problems associated with the delivery of the IF.","WTCOMTDM44.pdf","Bangladesh, Members, Secretariat, Members, WTO, WTO, Benin, WIPO, Bangladesh, United, Nations, WIPO, Members, WTO, WTO, WTO, Secretariat, Members"

The representative of Morocco said that his delegation supported the general orientation outlined by the Secretariat to achieve a real strengthening of the capacities of developing countries WT/COMTD/M/44 Page 18 and LDCs. The strengthening of capacities was a complex process which demanded an integrated approach. His delegation believed that the 2003 TA Plan, which had been qualitatively improved, would contribute even more to enhanced specialization, and involvement of regional academic institutions. The first experiences in that respect had been gained from the regional trade policy courses in Africa and he was pleased to hear that those courses would be continued and extended to other regions. Such initiatives had to be taken in collaboration with other institutions with relevant experience. Similar to other delegations, he had some questions with respect to the trade policy clinics, and especially with regard to the recommendations that might come from those clinics. He suggested that it might be useful to learn from other organizations who had experience in capacity building in the trade field. ITC and UNCTAD with its Trade Point Programme had already used the trade clinic concept.","WTCOMTDM44.pdf","Morocco, Secretariat, LDCs, Africa, ITC, UNCTAD, Trade, Point, Programme"
"4758",4758,"54","54.      The representative of the European Communities said that his delegation was interested in the evaluation that would be carried out on the 2002 TA Plan. It also had an interest in getting more information on the inter-relationship between the activities implemented and the financial and human resources deployed. On the question of outsourcing he said that his delegation looked forward to an opportunity to consider the outsourcing plan that the Secretariat was working on. Outsourcing was important to enable successful delivery of the 2003 TA Plan and future plans, given the resource constraints faced by the Secretariat, the difference in competence in various areas between the WTO Secretariat and other agencies, and the possible scope to utilise more local and regional delivery mechanisms. The DDAGTF was important and Members had to revert to it in the future on the basis of ideas and papers that would be forthcoming from the Secretariat. On the issue of trade policy clinics he said that he hoped that the Secretariat would soon present its ideas in writing. It was important to get the links between the trade policy clinics and other diagnostic processes right at the international inter-agency level and in the recipient countries. The resource implications of the trade policy clinics would have to be considered. It was also important to integrate the idea of the trade policy clinics into future TA programmes. He understood the idea that in order for the trade policy clinics to be effective they would have to respond to urgent needs of Members and that they therefore, in some sense, were impossible to predict. However, if Members were to do their TA work well, those elements would have to be considered and be integrated into the exercise. His delegation envisaged a continuous process of improvement in terms of programming, coordination and delivery of TA. That process of improvement had to be kept in mind when considering what had been achieved in 2002; what was being achieved in 2003; and to consider what could be done better in the future. It was not premature to begin to consider the strategy for coming years.","WTCOMTDM44.pdf","European, Communities, Secretariat, Secretariat, WTO, Secretariat, Members, Secretariat, Secretariat, Members, Members"

The representative of Australia said that her delegation particularly welcomed the information from the Secretariat regarding the acknowledgement of the special needs faced by small islands economies in the South Pacific. Her delegation noted the helpful comments made by the representatives of Barbados and Japan with respect to that issue. She said that the information provided in document WT/COMTD/W/101/Add.4 would serve as a useful complement to the findings of the TA Audit and the full evaluation, when it became available. She said that the Australian Government had announced, on 12 February 2003, that it would contribute a further $A 500,000 to the DDAGTF for TA in 2003. Her Government hoped that that contribution would contribute to efforts to put developing countries in the best position possible to take advantage of the opportunities that the Doha Development Round had to offer.","WTCOMTDM44.pdf","Australia, Secretariat, South, Pacific, Barbados, Japan, TA, Audit, Doha, Development, Round"
"4760",4760,"56","56.     The representative of Mauritius said that while the reported implementation rates at national and regional levels were impressive, it was important for Members to get a proper evaluation as mentioned by the delegations of Canada and the United States. His Government had benefited both at the regional and at the national levels. The activities carried out in Mauritius had also been audited and that audit should reveal some of the good work that had been done. The representative of Barbados had raised concerns about the ad hoc activities. It was the high share of ad hoc activities compared to planned activities that worried delegations as it raised questions with respect to the predictability and continuity of the TA Plans. He shared the views expressed by other delegations                                                                                     WT/COMTD/M/44                                                                                            Page 19 that, when outsourcing it was important to utilize resources from accredited institutions in various regions, especially local universities and other trade institutions in developing countries. With respect to the trade policy clinics he said that his delegation looked forward to the report that the Secretariat would provide to Members. He hoped that the trade policy clinics would bring additional value to what was already being done. The efficiency and results of the 2002 TA Plan would only be gauged after the full evaluation report had been provided. He thanked the Government of Australia for its contribution to the DDAGTF and said that he hoped that other Members would follow that initiative.","WTCOMTDM44.pdf","Mauritius, Members, Canada, United, States, Mauritius, Barbados, Secretariat, Members, Australia, Members"
"4761",4761,"57","57.      The representative of Tunisia said that the first table of the review of the 2002 TA Plan (WT/COMTD/W/101/Add.4) showed that the African region had the lowest implementation rate. In that context he asked how the Secretariat intended to follow up on the activities that had not been undertaken in 2002 and for which funds had already been allocated. His delegation attached importance to the implementation of those activities as his delegation had based its requests on real and urgent needs, in particular following the large range of issues treated in the Doha Development Agenda. He drew the Secretariat's attention to the fact that the national activities related to services and agriculture undertaken in 2002 mentioned on pages 7 and 43 of document WT/COMTD/W/101/Add.4 did not relate to the 2002 TA Plan but rather to the JITAP programme. The financial burden of those activities had been born by the Government of Tunisia. With respect to outsourcing he said that, as attendance at WTO meetings was restricted to a few people, it limited the knowledge outside consultants had of the negotiation process. It was therefore important to be careful when outsourcing in order to ensure the quality of the TA provided. He said that it had to be ensured that any outsourcing was done in a fair manner to consultants representing all WTO Members. His delegation would come forward with specific comments on the trade policy clinics once the Secretariat had issued a detailed report on the issue. He drew the Committee's attention to the fact that results of national studies had not been implemented. That was particularly true for the needs that the Government of Tunisia had in terms of Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures.","WTCOMTDM44.pdf","Tunisia, Secretariat, Doha, Development, Agenda, Secretariat, Tunisia, WTO, WTO, Members, Secretariat, Committee, Tunisia"
"4762",4762,"58","58.      The representative of China said that his delegation believed that the TA activities offered were useful to developing countries, particularly the LDCs and the recently acceded Members of the WTO. It provided them with opportunities to better understand the WTO Agreements and thereby helped improve their implementation of those agreements. TA activities assisted developing country Members participate fully in the new round of negotiations. He believed that Members should stick to the principles they had agreed to when formulating the 2004 TA Plan. The possibility of making ad hoc requests was one of them. That TA activities should be demand and member driven was another. There had to be a balance in the TA activities offered to different Members. That balanced treatment was important and was reflected in the 2003 TA Plan. However, flexibility had to be applied in treating ad hoc requests. Factors such as a specific need and situation, the status of the requesting Member in world trade, how long it had been a Member of the WTO, and the availability of human and financial resources had to be taken into account. With respect to the financial resources, he said that Members should not only rely on the DDAGTF but should also seek other forms of financing. Taking his own Government as an example, he said that some of the WTO TA activities from which the Government of China had benefited in 2002 had either been financed or co-financed by the Government of China, through bilateral assistance or through other international organizations. While attempting a balanced treatment of all Members, as reflected in the 2003 TA Plan, reasonable flexibility needed to be given to the treatment of the ad hoc requests, as long as the human resources were available in the Secretariat. However, an alternative solution existed if the human resources were not available in the Secretariat. An example was when the Government of China had requested an ad hoc national seminar on services in 2002 which had been financed by third party resources. That request had been turned down by the WTO Secretariat because of human resource constraints. However, while turning it down, the Secretariat had proposed other possible experts. That was a way of assisting Members when the human resources of the Secretariat were lacking.","WTCOMTDM44.pdf","China, LDCs, Members, WTO, WTO, Members, Members, Members, Member, Member, WTO, Members, WTO, China, Government, of, China, Members, Secretariat, Secretariat, China, WTO, Secretariat, Secretariat, Members, Secretariat"

The Secretariat (Mr. Paul Rolian, Director, Technical Cooperation Division) said that the commitment by the Secretariat to provide an evaluation of the 2002 TA activities by the end of WT/COMTD/M/44 Page 20 March 2003 would be honoured. That evaluation would respond to many of the comments made about the desire to have a fuller picture of what had happened in 2002, compared to what the Secretariat had been able to provide in the document containing statistical information on the implementation of the 2002 TA Plan (WT/COMTD/W/101/Add.4). Several delegations had agreed with the suggestion made by the representative of Canada about the desirability to have a link in the reporting between the activities implemented and the financial and human resources needed to carry them out. If something more was needed than the information that had already been made available to the Budget Committee, the Secretariat would be happy to consider how it might provide such information. Several delegations had expressed an interest in the three commitments that DDG Dr. Rana had referred to and for which he had promised further documentation: namely the issues of outsourcing, access to the DDAGTF and the trade clinics. The Secretariat would be working on all of those issues and would take the useful comments that had been made into account in the more detailed proposals it would be making. However, as far as the guidelines for the DDAGTF were concerned, the Secretariat was of the view that that was something for Members to decide. The Secretariat would follow any guidance it received. Many comments had also been made with respect to the ad hoc activities. The message to the Secretariat seemed to be that a degree of flexibility had to be maintained. The question was what degree of flexibility and in relation to what. That was also something that the Secretariat would be reflecting on when proposals for the 2004 TA Plan were elaborated and in carrying out the activities for 2003.","WTCOMTDM44.pdf","Secretariat, Paul, Rolian, Director, Technical, Cooperation, Division, Secretariat, Secretariat, Canada, Budget, Committee, Secretariat, Rana, Secretariat, Secretariat, Members, Secretariat, Secretariat, Secretariat"

"4765",4765,"60","60.      He went on to respond to the questions raised by the representative of Bangladesh and said that five regional LDC-specific activities had been undertaken in 2002. At least one LDC had been invited to over 80 regional activities which meant that in 80 regional activities there was at least one LDC present. Twenty-four per cent of the 109 planned national activities executed in 2002 had taken place in and benefited LDCs, i.e. 45 activities. With respect to the identification of lead agencies for the activities he said that that was not always as straight forward as it might appear. It was particularly difficult to identify a lead agency for jointly programmed and delivered activities when the WTO Secretariat worked in collaboration with partner agencies. A lead agency was not always established for joint activities. The practice had so far been to merely identify the agency with which the Secretariat collaborated for any given activity. With respect to the question of cancellations of activities and why the IF and mainstreaming activities had been singled out as being problematic, he said that it was not always possible to deliver activities planned 12 to 15 months in advance since many of them require the establishment of appropriate mechanisms in the beneficiary countries as well as among the six core agencies collaborating on the IF and the donor community. The Diagnostic Trade Integration Studies (DTIS) could only be conducted once local and international experts had been recruited. Roundtables could only take place once the various stakeholders had had time to review priority areas of action identified in the DTIS, and a lead donor had been identified. Finally, the time-frames in which the different agencies operated were not always the same. With respect to the point made by the representative of Tunisia, he said that it was statistically true that the lowest implementation rate was found for the activities planned in Africa. However, it was the lowest percentage of the highest number of activities. The more activities were planned, the more likely it was that something might happen that would make it impossible to carry out some of the activities. The Secretariat was considering the re-programming of some of those activities. Nevertheless, if the conditions which led to the cancellation of the activity in the first place had not changed, the activity could probably still not be carried out. The representative of the European Communities had made a comment about having a continuous process of improvement of WTO TA as it was implemented. The Secretariat would consider if improvements could be made, although it would not consider changing the 2003 TA Plan as it had been agreed by Members. More importantly, the Secretariat would soon begin to consider what kind of programme to propose to Members for 2004. That was what he had referred to when speaking about the ad hoc activities. How such activities were to be considered was a function of how the overall TA Plan was conceived.","WTCOMTDM44.pdf","Bangladesh, LDC, WTO, Secretariat, Secretariat, Tunisia, Africa, Secretariat, WTO, Secretariat, Members, Secretariat, Members"
"4766",4766,"61","61.     The Secretariat (Mr. Alberto Campeas, Director, Development Division) said that, as delegations would recall, the 2003 TA Plan had an Addendum 2 containing ""Outreach Activities""                                                                                      WT/COMTD/M/44                                                                                             Page 21 (WT/COMTD/W/104/Add.2). The first of the outreach activities listed there was a Trade and Environment Symposium for NGOs to be held in Geneva. Linked to that activity was a footnote which stated that the Secretariat would consult Members in the Committee on Trade and Environment (CTE) and the CTD on the modalities, agenda and participation in respect of that symposium. The CTE had been consulted at its meeting on 14 February 2003 and he said that the Secretariat would, at the current meeting, welcome any input from the CTD on those points. He informed the Committee that the focal point in the WTO Secretariat for the event was the External Relations Division (Mr. Hans-Peter Werner and Mr. Bernard Kuiten) and that the Symposium, which was being financed by the Government of Norway, was scheduled for 16-17 June 2003. An information note would be issued to Members later in March 2003.","WTCOMTDM44.pdf","Secretariat, Alberto, Campeas, Director, Development, Division, Geneva, Secretariat, Members, Committee, CTD, CTE, Secretariat, CTD, Committee, WTO, Secretariat, Hans-Peter, Werner, Bernard, Kuiten, Norway, Members"
"4767",4767,"62","62.      The representative of Egypt asked the Secretariat to provide information on the outcome of the consultations with the CTE relating to the Trade and Environment Symposium for NGOs. He further asked whether the paper on the Trade and Environment Symposium for NGOs would include the issues to be discussed at the Symposium and its expected outcome. He also asked whether the CTD would approve that document or simply take note of it. With respect to document WT/COMTD/W/101/Add.4 he questioned the activities described as ""Conference/Briefing"". One example in the area of Trade and Environment could be found on page 50. He wondered how the CITES Conference could be described as a TA activity and how it related to paragraph 33 of the Doha Ministerial Declaration. He assumed that the activities labelled ""Conference/Briefing"" meant that a WTO official attended that Conference, and that, in the case of the CITES, the WTO, attended the Conference as an observer and briefed the participants about the WTO. He questioned how that could be regarded as TA, especially as the participants in those conferences came from both developed and developing countries. He asked if the travel costs for the WTO Secretariat person attending that Conference was covered by the Trust Fund reserved for TA.","WTCOMTDM44.pdf","Egypt, Secretariat, CTD, WTO, WTO, WTO, WTO, Secretariat, Trust, Fund"
"4768",4768,"63","63.      The representative of Malaysia said that TA remained a cornerstone of WTO activity and welcomed the contributions made to the DDAGTF, particularly the announcements made by the delegations of Australia and Japan. She noted the comments that had been made by the delegations of the United States, Canada and the European Communities and those that had been made at previous meetings by developing country members regarding the need for effective, targeted TA. The evaluation of the activities carried out in 2002 was going to be helpful in that respect and would help Members plan the activities for 2004. Future TA plans should lead to more substantive outcomes in the area of capacity building. Her delegation agreed that there should be a proper regional balance of the WTO TA activities, including the host countries for regional activities. However, she knew that the location chosen sometimes depended on the partner organization. She therefore suggested that the WTO Secretariat explore with the other organizations the possibility of some rotation of host countries for regional TA activities. Her Government had had the opportunity to host a regional activity in 2002 from which it had benefited a lot. Nevertheless, based on previous experience, her Government felt that more importance should be attached to coordination with the host country when organizing regional activities. That would facilitate the delivery of the activity and would ensure a more substantive outcome.","WTCOMTDM44.pdf","Malaysia, WTO, Australia, Japan, United, States, Canada, Members, WTO, WTO, Secretariat"
"4769",4769,"64","64.      She further said that the Secretariat needed to be careful in the selection of consultants to outsource to in order to maintain the quality of the TA delivered. Her delegation therefore supported the establishment of proper criteria and guidelines for the sourcing of the experts. The use of ex-Secretariat staff or former Ambassadors, as well as academic staff was welcome. She hoped that there would be a balance between developed and developing country experts. However, that should not effect the overriding criteria that the experts should possess the requisite expertise. Her delegation thus agreed with the suggestion made by the representatives of Barbados and Tunisia for a regional perspective in the sourcing of the experts. She sought clarification with respect to the preparation of the roster and whether it would be made available to Members as some Members might wish to make use of that list of experts for their own technical cooperation programmes. She said that her delegation was of the understanding that the trade clinics were meant to address Members' trade WT/COMTD/M/44 Page 22 policy problems from a macro perspective. Appropriate resources would therefore have to be made available. She asked who the Secretariat envisaged would be in position to provide that diagnostic analysis and the corresponding trade policy advice and if there were any particular linkages between the trade policy clinics and the IF. Her delegation welcomed the suggestion made by the representative of the United States for different modes of delivery to be considered. On-line delivery had been proposed and she said that she believed that that could be helpful. For example, the material used in WTO TA delivery could be made available online for officials in capitals to be able to access it. There had been a recent proposal for the attachment of capital based officials in the missions. That was a practical way of enhancing developing countries' expertise in the WTO by actual on-site experience. It would also enhance Members' ability to participate in the WTO and she asked whether that was part of the 2003 TA Plan. Lastly, she said that her delegation welcomed the attention given to the economies from regions constituting special challenges. She sought clarification as to how they would be treated in the 2003 TA Plan. She asked whether they would be involved in the activities for the regions already identified or whether a separate category would be created for them.","WTCOMTDM44.pdf","Secretariat, Barbados, Tunisia, Members, Members, Members, Secretariat, United, States, WTO, WTO, Members, WTO"
"4770",4770,"65","65.      The representative of Thailand said that her delegation agreed with other delegations that the qualitative aspect of the TA Plan was important. Her delegation was therefore awaiting the evaluation of the implementation of the 2002 TA Plan. She sought more information on the partnerships between the WTO and other organizations and suggested that it would be useful for delegations to get updated information on that cooperation. There seemed to have been some recent developments in that area as she had learned that the WTO had signed an MoU the previous week with the International Institute on Trade and Development in Thailand. Her delegation was grateful for that and hoped that that cooperation would improve the TA delivered in the Asian region. With respect to the trade policy clinics she said that her delegation supported the thrust of the idea and saw it as another way to help developing countries. However, it had to be flexible and should not duplicate existing TA programmes. She therefore looked forward to receiving more information on the trade policy clinics from the Secretariat.","WTCOMTDM44.pdf","Thailand, WTO, WTO, International, Institute, on, Trade, and, Development, Thailand, Secretariat"
"4771",4771,"66","66.     The Secretariat (Mr. Alberto Campeas, Director, Development Division) said, in response to the query by the delegation of Egypt, that the CTE had been informed, just as the CTD had been at the current meeting, of the future organization of the Trade and Environment Symposium for NGOs. There had been no detailed discussion in the CTE which seemed to indicate a positive reception by Members of the plans by the Secretariat. The External Relations Division of the Secretariat was in charge of preparing the programme. If Members wished to see specific elements reflected in the programme, he suggested that they contact the External Relations Division in order for their ideas to be included.","WTCOMTDM44.pdf","Secretariat, Alberto, Campeas, Director, Development, Division, Egypt, CTE, CTD, CTE, Members, Secretariat, Secretariat, Members"
"4772",4772,"67","67.     The Secretariat (Mr. Paul Rolian, Director, Technical Cooperation Division) said, in response to a question posed by the delegation of Egypt, that attendance at certain conferences allowed the Secretariat to hold back-to-back activities during which the Secretariat explained the work of the WTO in the particular field, such as the link between trade and environment. Such activities were not only open to Governments but also to the environment community at large. The Secretariat saw this as a good way to pass an important message. Several of the activities referred to had been part of the 2002 TA Plan. The ones that had not been inscribed in the 2002 TA Plan had been carried out in the same spirit of taking the opportunity, at a low cost (the cost of sending a staff member) to brief the Conference attendees of what the WTO was doing in the area of trade and environment. The representative of Malaysia had suggested that the Secretariat be careful when establishing the roster of experts to outsource to, and that it should ensure that developing country experts be included. He assured delegations that anybody who had the necessary qualifications, competence and profile could be included in the roster. He was convinced that many such experts would come from developing country regions. The roster could be made available to Members if the persons in question authorized the Secretariat to transmit the information to others; it would otherwise have to be treated in confidence. He said that the Secretariat was not currently thinking of making a special link between                                                                                   WT/COMTD/M/44                                                                                          Page 23 the trade policy clinics and the IF. However, if ways of tying them together became apparent they could be more closely linked in the future; but they were separate initiatives for the time being.","WTCOMTDM44.pdf","Secretariat, Paul, Rolian, Director, Technical, Cooperation, Division, Egypt, Secretariat, Secretariat, WTO, Secretariat, WTO, Malaysia, Secretariat, Members, Secretariat, Secretariat"
"4773",4773,"68","68.      The representative of Egypt said that, what Members had decided in the 43rd Session of the CTD when the issue of the Trade and Environment Symposium for NGOs had been discussed was that the modalities of the Symposium would be approved by both the CTD and the CTE, and not that every interested delegation had to individually contact the External Relations Division. What his delegation expected was that a draft, including the issues to be discussed and other aspects of the Symposium, be circulated both in the CTD and in the CTE. The CTD and in the CTE would then approve the plans for the Symposium before it was to be held.","WTCOMTDM44.pdf","Egypt, Members, CTD, CTD, CTE, CTD, CTE, CTD, CTE"
"4774",4774,"69","69.      The Chairman said that the delegation of Egypt had requested that the subject matter for the Trade and Environment Symposium for NGOs be referred to Members so that Members could comment on it in both the CTD and the CTE and that the Symposium could only be organized thereafter. The Secretariat had drawn his attention to a problem with regard to the sequencing of the Trade and Environment Symposium for NGOs and the need to consult the Members of the CTD and the CTE. As the Symposium would be held in mid-June it seemed difficult to ensure that an additional meeting of the CTD would be held sufficiently in advance of the Symposium to discuss its modalities, agenda and participation. He therefore proposed that the External Relations Division soon circulate a paper regarding the Trade and Environment Symposium for NGOs. Members would then get an opportunity to discuss that paper at the CTE meeting in April 2003. Any comments by any Member of the CTD could be communicated to the organizers of the Symposium.","WTCOMTDM44.pdf","Chairman, Egypt, Members, Members, CTD, CTE, Secretariat, Members, CTD, CTE, CTD, Members, CTE, Member, CTD"

It had also been requested that the item be taken up directly after the item on technical cooperation.","WTCOMTDM44.pdf","Chairman, Kenya"
"4779",4779,"73","73.     The Committee agreed to that request.","WTCOMTDM44.pdf","Committee"
"4780",4780,"74","74.      The representative of Kenya said that the request for the item to be added to the CTD Agenda had been made by her delegation and a number of other Commonwealth Members. They had intended to circulate a non-paper as a basis for discussions. That paper contained some preliminary ideas on action that could be taken under the WTO rules-based system to deal with the crisis situation which had been created by the long term trend of declining commodity prices and its implications for the trade and development of developing countries, most of which were heavily dependent on exports of primary commodities. The continuous series of WTO meetings held during the previous two weeks had made it impossible for the interested delegations to meet and finalize the paper. It had therefore been decided that she should make a brief statement highlighting some of the issues in the non-paper. She expected to be able to submit the non-paper to the Secretariat within the coming two weeks for circulation to Members. She said that her statement was being made on behalf of the delegations of Uganda, Tanzania, Lesotho and Zimbabwe who had all agreed to co-sponsor the non-paper.

"4781",4781,"75","75.      She went on to say that, until the last months of 2002, the prices of primary commodities had prevailed at exceptionally low levels. For instance, the prices of coffee, cocoa, sugar and palm oil had declined by nearly 70 per cent in the 22 year period from 1980 to 2002. The prices of other agricultural commodities had also declined during the same period, but by a lesser percentage. They included the prices of cotton and vegetable oils like coconut oil, which were almost 50 per cent lower in 2000 when compared to the prevailing price-levels in 1980. Nearly 50 developing countries depended on three or fewer commodities for a large proportion of their exports. In the case of Kenya, Uganda and Tanzania for example, three primary commodities (i.e. coffee, tea and cotton) accounted for between 42 to 44 per cent of their merchandise exports. The prices of a number of commodities had risen in recent months. However, in the case of agricultural commodities such as coffee, cotton and vegetable oils, that was the result of poor harvests caused by bad weather and drought in some of the producing countries. In the case of cocoa, the rise in prices partly reflected the impact of civil war on production in Côte d'Ivoire. The present sudden rise in commodity prices was thus temporary. It was a result of short-term supply constraints and did not reflect any long lasting trend towards improved balance between world supply and demand. The secular trend towards a decline in the prices of those commodities and their volatility had created a crisis situation in most of the commodity producing countries, as there was a close relationship between world market prices and poverty levels. In most of the countries, the production of crops such as coffee, cocoa and sugarcane was undertaken by poor subsistence farmers, who in most cases were heavily indebted. The decline in prices for their produce had further reduced their meager income. Small scale coffee and cocoa farmers were currently getting a third of the price they had been receiving in earlier years. The result was that an increasing number of farmers who produced those crops were living below poverty levels. The worst affected were the heavily indebted countries, which directed major portions of their foreign exchange revenue towards the servicing of debts. The ability of those and other developing countries to alleviate poverty and to integrate themselves into the fast growing global economy was therefore greatly dependent on how quickly they were able to address the decline in the terms of trade for primary commodities. That observation lead to the question of what action WTO Members could take and why action was necessary in the WTO. She said that, in the view of her delegation and of those that were co-sponsoring the non-paper, there were two reasons why it would be necessary to address, in the ongoing work and negotiations in WTO, the problems posed to the trade and development of developing countries by declining prices of primary commodities. Firstly, as all countries attached political importance to the role of the WTO, raising the crisis situation created by declining commodity prices for discussions in the WTO might bring to the attention of the general public the need and urgency of taking early action at the international level. Secondly, and more importantly, that would facilitate a resolution on the basis of WTO's rules-based system, including, in the context of the ongoing negotiations for the liberalization of trade in the agricultural sector.","WTCOMTDM44.pdf","Kenya, Uganda, Tanzania, WTO, Members, WTO, WTO, WTO, WTO, WTO"
"4782",4782,"76","76.      She further said that, in the past rounds of negotiations held under the auspices of the GATT, the negotiations for the liberalization of trade in primary agricultural commodities which were produced predominantly in the tropics, had not been held in the negotiating group on agriculture, but in a separate group constituted for that purpose. The priority attention given to the removal of tariffs and non tariff measures affecting trade in tropical products in the past rounds, resulted in the elimination of tariffs on almost all tropical products in their primary form by all developed countries. However, some of those countries still maintained duties on an MFN basis on imports of processed products, except in cases where duties had been lowered under preferential arrangements. In the present round of negotiations, no separate negotiating group on tropical products had been constituted. Negotiations addressing problems in the trade in those products were expected to take place in the Special Session of the Committee on Agriculture, which was responsible for negotiating the liberalization of trade in agricultural products. In his first draft containing possible modalities that could be adopted for negotiations on agriculture, the Chairman of the Special Session of the Committee on Agriculture had proposed that ""In implementing their market access commitments, developed country Members should take fully into account the particular needs and conditions of developing country Members by providing for greater improvement of opportunities and terms of access for agricultural products of particular interest to these Members, including the fullest                                                                                      WT/COMTD/M/44                                                                                             Page 25 liberalization of trade in tropical products, whether in primary or in processed form, ..."".1 Further, in order to ensure that reductions made in the MFN tariff did not lead to a sudden disruption of trade to countries which benefit from preferential access, the paper proposed that, in implementing their commitments, ""participants extending preferential treatment, should undertake to maintain to the extent possible, the nominal margins and other terms and conditions they accord to their developed country partners"". However, past work and the negotiations in the GATT had centered almost entirely on securing improvements in the access for tropical products in the markets of developed countries through removal of tariffs and other barriers of trade.","WTCOMTDM44.pdf","GATT, MFN, Committee, on, Agriculture, Chairman, Committee, on, Agriculture, Members, Members, Members, MFN, GATT"
"4783",4783,"77","77.      She then said that the focus in the present round of negotiations would be to also secure further improvements of market access, particularly through securing further reductions in the tariffs applicable to processed products and on the removal of tariff escalation. Some progress might also be made in requiring developed countries to reduce trade distorting domestic and export subsidies (including export finance and credits) which they granted to tropical products such as cotton and sugar. Unless definite decisions were taken to broaden the area of negotiations, issues relating to the impact of declining prices of primary commodities on trade and development were not expected to be covered by the negotiations. UNCTAD had so far provided the main forum for discussions on the problems faced by commodity exporting countries as a result of declining prices of primary commodities and their volatility. Its mandate to work on commodity issues had enabled it to renegotiate, in the second half of seventies, the existing international agreements on commodities such as those on coffee, cocoa and sugar and to promote the establishment of the common fund for commodities. She noticed that, when taking into account the role which UNCTAD had played in the past and was playing at present in the commodity field, it was often argued that the WTO should not get involved in the discussions on the stabilization of prices. In that context, she said that she thought that it was important for Members to note that during the same period negotiations for developing commodity agreements for coffee, cocoa and sugar had been held in UNCTAD, arrangements for the management of supplies, through inter alia, control over production of bovine meat and diary products had been adopted during the agricultural negotiations in the Tokyo Round (viz. Agreement on Bovine Meat and International Agreement on Dairy Products). The International Agreement on Diary Products had also provided a mechanism for the maintenance of prices at agreed levels.","WTCOMTDM44.pdf","UNCTAD, UNCTAD, WTO, Members, UNCTAD, Tokyo"
"4784",4784,"78","78.      She continued by saying that a more definitive legal basis for negotiations on stabilization of prices of primary commodities that were of export interest to developing countries was provided in Part IV (chapter on Trade and Development) of the GATT 1994. Its Article XXXVI, which laid down principles and objectives, stated that: There is a need … to devise … measures designed to stabilize and improve conditions of world markets in these (primary) products including in particular measures designed to attain stable, equitable and remunerative prices. Those provisions were complemented by Article XXXVIII on ""joint action"" which inter alia stated that towards that end, Members might negotiate and adopt ""international arrangements"" providing for: Improved and acceptable conditions to access to world markets of primary products of particular interest to developing countries; and Measures designed to stabilize and improve conditions of world markets in these products, including measures designed to attain stable, equitable and remunerative prices for exports of such products. Taking into account the responsibility which the above-mentioned provisions of GATT put on WTO Members, the non-paper intended to propose that the CTD examine on a priority basis the impact which the crisis situation created by declining prices had on: the trade and development of countries which were heavily dependent on exports of primary commodities; and their capacity to pay and service their foreign debts. Such an examination, as envisaged in Article XXXVIII, should further aim at drawing out a program for ""joint action"" that could be taken in the course of ongoing work and negotiations in WTO.","WTCOMTDM44.pdf","GATT, Members, GATT, WTO, Members, CTD, WTO"
"4785",4785,"79","79.    Before concluding, she emphasized that her delegation, as well as the delegations of Uganda, Tanzania, Lesotho and Zimbabwe on whose behalf she was making the statement, were keen on         1             TN/AG/W/1 WT/COMTD/M/44 Page 26 ensuring that the recommendations of the CTD on the type of action that could be taken in WTO to deal with the problems posed as a result of declining prices of primary commodities, was made available, as appropriate, to the Cancún Ministerial Conference. Since there would be at best two regular sessions of the Committee before that date, the sponsors of the non-paper considered that it might be necessary for the Committee to convene special sessions or appoint a Sub-Committee to consider the issues relating to the prices of primary commodities which she had raised. To facilitate discussions on those issues, she requested the incoming Chairman to arrange for informal consultations in the third week of March, immediately after the circulation of the non-paper. That consultation would enable Members to agree on the background research papers that would be needed for the examination of the various elements to which she had referred, and allocate the responsibility for preparing them among the WTO, UNCTAD, the Commonwealth Secretariat and other agencies which would be invited to participate in the discussions on the subject. She said that she had highlighted the main issues in the non-paper, as that would enable delegations to study them and come prepared to participate in the informal discussions to be held. For people in Kenya, and those in about 50 other developing countries which were heavily dependent on exports of primary commodities, the ongoing Doha Development Round would only be meaningful if it succeed in finding solutions, during the course of the negotiations, to the problems posed by declining prices of commodities. If the Doha Development Round failed to find such solutions, the Round might not have any significant impact on the trade and development of those countries. She encouraged other Members affected by declining primary commodity prices to consider co-sponsoring the non-paper when it was circulated.","WTCOMTDM44.pdf","Uganda, Tanzania, Lesotho, Zimbabwe, CTD, WTO, Cancún, Ministerial, Conference, Committee, Committee, Sub-Committee, Chairman, Members, WTO, Commonwealth, Secretariat, Kenya, Doha, Development, Round, Doha, Development, Round, Members"

The representative of Canada said that he was pleased to present the notification containing the initiative by the Government of Canada to enhance market access for the LDCs in accordance with the Enabling Clause. He also said that, judging from what he had seen of the report on the trade policy review of Canada that would be held the following week, he anticipated that the WTO would once again recognize that the Government of Canada pursued an open trade policy, and that Canada                                                                                    WT/COMTD/M/44                                                                                            Page 3 had benefited significantly from its liberalized trade regime. Trade had led the economic growth of Canada for the last decade. It was only in the last few months that domestic economic activity had led economic growth in Canada. The Canadian economy was strong, the fundamentals good and growth projections for 2003 and 2004 were anticipated to lead the Group of Eight industrialized countries (G8). While trade was important for Canada, he said that his Government believed that trade was important for all countries. Part of his responsibilities, as Director-General for Economic Policy in the Foreign Affairs Department of the Government of Canada, included his Government's relations with developing countries. In addition to trade relations, it included relations from the perspective of development, debt, and the international institutions that dealt with developing country issues. The Government of Canada had been following the development policy evolution in the international community during the past five years. The International Conference on Financing for Development, held in Monterrey, Mexico on 18-22 March 2002, had been a seminal event which had set out a new blue-print for relations between developed and developing countries. Later in 2002, the Prime Minister of Canada had chaired the Annual Meeting of the G8 held in Kananaskis, Canada. Key to that meeting was the initiative to enhance relations between the G8 and African countries. The Canadian initiative of increased market access for LDCs had been taken in that broader overall development context.","WTCOMTDM44.pdf","Canada, Canada, LDCs, Canada, WTO, Canada, Canada, Canada, Canada, Canada, Director-General, Foreign, Affairs, Department, Canada, Canada, Monterrey, Mexico, Canada, Kananaskis, Canada, LDCs"

The representative of Barbados said that her delegation welcomed the work that other delegations had put into emphasizing the importance to primary commodity producing developing countries of trade in those commodities. That trade was important to their economic development programmes. The representative of Kenya had clearly outlined how the lack of stability of commodity prices could provoke crisis situations in the exporting countries. Her delegation fully endorsed the initiative to raise the issue of commodity trade in the WTO, and specifically in the CTD, with a view to examine what trade-related action might be necessary, and possible, in the WTO. That consideration should be made with the short term aim of making recommendations for action to the Cancún Ministerial Conference.","WTCOMTDM44.pdf","Barbados, Kenya, WTO, CTD, WTO"

"4794",4794,"87","87.     The Chairman said that agenda item E on Electronic Commerce was a standing item on the Agenda of the Committee. At the 42nd Session of the CTD, the delegation of Canada had asked for a document which would update delegation's memory on the work that had been carried out in the CTD with respect to electronic commerce (e-commerce). Document WT/COMTD/W/110, which aimed to respond to that request, showed that the CTD had actually been one of the most active of the four subsidiary bodies of the General Council which were tasked to consider the issue of e-commerce. An extensive educational process had been undertaken on issues relating to electronic commerce and development. He invited comments on the document and asked Members for ideas about how they wished to handle the issue of e-commerce in the CTD.","WTCOMTDM44.pdf","Chairman, Electronic, Commerce, Committee, CTD, Canada, CTD, CTD, General, Council, Members, CTD"
"4795",4795,"88","88.      The representative of the United States said that her delegation had only recently seen the document and was therefore not in a position to comment intensively on it. However, her delegation would study it and use it to consider what further work the CTD might undertake on e-commerce in the future.","WTCOMTDM44.pdf","United, States, CTD"
"4796",4796,"89","89.     The representative of Canada said that her delegation's preliminary view was that the paper appropriately outlined the important work carried out by the CTD. She noted that the CTD had been one of the more active of the four subsidiary bodies to the General Council currently engaged in the Work Programme on E-commerce. Her delegation looked forward to continued work in that area within the CTD. E-commerce represented an important means of doing business in the knowledge- based economy and had the potential to benefit developed and developing countries alike. Her delegation looked forward to building upon the work already carried out in the CTD in the area of e- commerce and welcomed other Members' views on how best to proceed.","WTCOMTDM44.pdf","Canada, CTD, General, Council, Work, Programme, CTD, Members"
"4797",4797,"9","9.       He further said that, although the WTO was a trade forum, he wished to situate the Canadian initiative more widely to show that the Government of Canada was attempting to develop a coherent policy on trade and development. One example was that the Government of Canada, amongst other nations, had been promoting the inclusion of trade in the Poverty Reduction Strategy Papers that were being developed in the context of the World Bank and were being used by the IMF. The Government of Canada was of the view that economic growth had to be developed in order for poverty reduction to be achieved. Trade was one contributor to economic growth, although not the only one. Canada had benefitted from its trade relations and from the advantage of having a good neighbor which had enhanced Canada's economic position. Enhancing trade would contribute to poverty reduction, as identified in the Millennium Goals that all Governments had agreed to in the United Nations. Investment could be stimulated by trade liberalization, particularly in the LDCs, and that would provide further opportunities for growth. Aid in itself was not sufficient to alleviate poverty. The initiative by the Government of Canada was therefore to provide duty-free and quota-free access for all products originating in 48 LDCs, with the exception of three types of agricultural products which were under supply management in Canada, i.e. dairy products, poultry products, and eggs. However, those exceptions only represented about 200 tariff lines out of the 8000 tariff lines in the Canadian tariff which provided complete duty and quota-free access for products originating in LDCs. Nevertheless, the Government of Canada had, even in those supply-managed products, made in-quota access commitments which were open to any country to benefit from. The LDC tariff (the LDCT in Canada) concerned approximately 90 per cent of the Canadian schedule prior to the new initiative. The Government of Canada had, with the new initiative for LDCs, moved into sensitive sectors of the Canadian economy, such as textiles, clothing, sugar, foot-ware, that had, in Canadian economic terms, traditionally enjoyed a higher form of protection than other products. It had not been an easy task for the Government of Canada to secure a consensus to undertake the initiative for LDCs. He said that he believed that it was through the initiative of the Prime Minister of Canada, and his commitment to the African Agenda as expressed through the NEPAD, and the support of Mr. Pettigrew, Minister for International Trade, that the LDC initiative had materialized.","WTCOMTDM44.pdf","WTO, Canada, Canada, World, Bank, IMF, Canada, Canada, Canada, United, Nations, Canada, Canada, Canada, LDCT, Canada, Canada, LDCs, Government, of, Canada, Canada, Pettigrew"
"4798",4798,"90","90.      The representative of Egypt said that the paper outlined the good work that had been carried out on e-commerce in the CTD. As mentioned by the representative of the United States, the paper had recently been circulated which was why his comments were preliminary. He would provide more detailed comments at a later stage. His delegation believed that the process had to be reactivated. It had been shown that e-commerce could be one way of enhancing the economic performance of developing countries and LDCs. The papers submitted in the past as well as the seminars convened in the WTO and elsewhere outlined the major areas that would require consideration in the discussions on e-commerce. Most important were the questions of how a developing country could be e-ready for it to reap the real benefits of e-commerce and how the negative implications of e-commerce on exports from developing countries could be mitigated. The representative of Canada had, in an earlier intervention, underscored the importance of South-South trade. He believed that enhancing the e-capacity of developing countries would contribute substantially to their economic development. Paragraph 15 of the Secretariat paper captured the issues that needed to be addressed under the rubric of e-commerce and mainstreaming trade for developing countries' growth. His delegation believed that Members should base their discussions on the report submitted to the General Council in 2000. The focus should be on the issues which fell within the competence of the CTD. Members could also draw on the relevant papers issued in other relevant international organizations. The aim should be to formulate a set of recommendations for Ministers to consider. His delegation looked forward to continue the work on e-commerce at a faster pace in order to make operational the means that would help developing countries reap the benefits of e-commerce.

"4801",4801,"93","93.      The Chairman said that agenda Item G was a standing item on the agenda which related to paragraph 51 of the Doha Ministerial Declaration on identifying and debating developmental and environmental aspects of the negotiations in order to help achieve the objective of having sustainable development appropriately reflected. Shortly after the Johannesburg World Summit on Sustainable Development it had been agreed that the CTD might consider the negotiated documents that emerged from that Summit. Those documents, in their preliminary versions, had been circulated to Members in multi-symbol document WT/COMTD/W/106 - WT/CTE/W/220, as the CTE had also wished to consider them. In that context, he informed Members that the final versions had been circulated as document WT/COMTD/W/106/Rev.1. - WT/CTE/W/220/Rev.1. He said that Members had had some time to consider how they wished to deal with the issue in the context of the CTD and sought Members' views on how to move the issue forward in the CTD.","WTCOMTDM44.pdf","Chairman, Johannesburg, CTD, Members, CTE, Members, Members, CTD, Members, CTD"
"4802",4802,"94","94.      The representative of the European Communities said that his delegation's views on the issue were well known. He was therefore not in a position to respond to the Chairman's request for new ideas on how to deal with it. His delegation maintained the view that paragraph 51 of the Doha Ministerial Declaration was important. It was of importance and mutual interest to all delegations to give effect to it in a more substantive way than Members had previously been able to. What had been said in the CTD and in other WTO fora in recent weeks had reinforced the benefit and mutual interest of taking the instruction in paragraph 51 of the Doha Ministerial Declaration forward in a more concrete manner. The representative of Kenya had raised an item relating to commodities which seemed linked to other aspects of the Doha Development Agenda, in particular to market access, subsidies and developmental concerns. Apart from those particular points raised with respect to commodities, Members were aware of the discussions relating to S&D and in determining the modalities of the market access negotiations. One important theme in that respect was how to take account of the particular concerns and interests of developing countries. It was not an aspect that was only taken up in the context of the market access negotiations, but it was an important element of the more regulatory discussions taking place in other groups within the structure of the Doha Development Agenda. It was increasingly urgent to reach agreement on how to give effect to paragraph 51 of the Doha Ministerial Declaration. He further said that his delegation attached importance to the NGO seminar on sustainable development to be held in June 2003. He suggested that to maximize the synergies between the meetings of the CTD and that Symposium, it might be useful to schedule a future meeting of the CTD back-to-back with the Symposium. That would create greater scope for interaction, in an informal manner, between the two events. Such interaction was important in order to give an effective focus to the outreach activity in form of the Symposium.","WTCOMTDM44.pdf","European, Communities, Chairman, Members, CTD, WTO, Kenya, Doha, Development, Agenda, Members, Doha, Development, Agenda, CTD, CTD"

"4804",4804,"96","96.      The representative of the United States suggested that Members initially consider a practical way to proceed. Much work was being done in other WTO bodies such as the consideration of the modalities with respect to S&D, reciprocity in the context of market access, the overarching S&D issues, the S&D monitoring mechanism, and work in the rules area. In light of all that she asked whether it would be possible for the CTD to periodically receive information from Secretariat staff on                                                                                    WT/COMTD/M/44                                                                                           Page 29 what the different negotiating groups were doing in relation to the development agenda. Her delegation was flexible with respect to how that might be done. However, as delegations seemed to have concerns about what the Committee could do with respect to paragraph 51 of the Doha Ministerial Declaration, she suggested that an information process might be a pragmatic start that would assist delegations understand the breath and the depth of the relationships. She agreed with the representative from the European Communities that learning from other ongoing events, such as the NGO Symposium on sustainable development, might be useful in deciding on how to treat the issue in the CTD in the future.","WTCOMTDM44.pdf","United, States, Members, WTO, S&D, CTD, Secretariat, Committee, CTD"

The representative of Malaysia said that the suggestion made by the representative of United States to receive information on what the negotiating bodies were doing that might be linked to paragraph 51 of the Doha Ministerial Declaration was a good idea. She said that, since the CTD might not have the resources to do everything at once, she suggested that the Committee request information from one or two negotiating groups at a time in order to allow for discussions.

"4823",4823,"101","101.     The representative of Japan introduced his Government's recent revisions to its GSP scheme. As his delegation had mentioned at several occasions, including during discussions at the CTD, it had considered expanding the number of products originating in the LDCs which received duty-free and quota-free treatment for fiscal year 2003, which started on 1 April 2003. The expansion of the product coverage had been done with a view to further contributing to the development of developing countries, especially the LDCs, through trade. Market access was one of the most important areas in the ongoing negotiations at the WTO. Besides the ongoing negotiations, many measures for improving market access for developing countries, in particular LDCs, had been taken by the Members, such as the ""Everything but Arms"" initiative by the European Communities' Commission and the ""African Growth and Opportunity Act"" by the Government of the United States. The Governments of Australia and Switzerland had also recently taken similar initiatives. Such measures were further encouraged by the Doha Development Agenda as seen for example in paragraph 42 of the Doha Ministerial Declaration. The Government of Japan had, like other Members, recently received a briefing at the Sub-Committee on Least-Developed Countries by the Canadian delegation on initiatives undertaken by the Government of Canada in favour of LDCs. His delegation remained one of the partners determined to continue to work towards the objective of duty-free and quota-free market access for all products originating in the LDCs. Against that background, the Government of Japan had taken the decision to immediately examine, in connection with the revision of its tariff- related laws, the possibility to expand the coverage of products originating in the LDCs receiving duty-free and quota-free treatment as announced at the meeting of the G8 in Kananaskis, Canada, in June 2002. The decision had taken concrete form as of 1 April 2003.","WTCOMTDM45.pdf","Japan, CTD, WTO, Members, European, Communities, ', Commission, United, States, Australia, Switzerland, Doha, Development, Agenda, Japan, Members, Canada, Japan, LDCs, Kananaskis, Canada"

He went on to say that he wished to give an overview of the new measures presented in detail in WTO document WT/COMTD/N/2/Add.12 of 12 May 2003 containing the notification by the Government of Japan. The number of LDCs' agricultural and fishery products qualifying for duty-free and quota-free treatment had been increased to around 500 items from around 300 items. In other words, an additional 200 items including prawns and frozen fish fillets had been added. As for LDCs' industrial products, almost all items had already been given duty-free and quota-free treatment. That expansion was expected to bring the percentage of products under such treatment from around 80 per cent to over 90 per cent of the total import value from the LDCs. The agricultural and fishery products which had been added were listed in Annexes I and II, as well as in the table related to                                                                                     WT/COMTD/M/45                                                                                            Page 29 paragraph 6 of the notification. In addition, the number of products under Japan's GSP scheme which benefited not only the LDCs, but also other developing countries had been increased. Around 120 new items had been added, almost all of which were agricultural products such dry as dried prunes, coconut oil, avocado and papayas. Furthermore, the tariff rates of around 60 existing items under the GSP scheme had been reduced. Japan's GSP scheme was open to 164 developing countries and regions on a non discriminatory basis. One hundred and eighteen (118) new agricultural products, listed in Annexes II and III as well as in a table relating to paragraph 7 of the notification, had also been added to the current 221 agricultural items that were eligible for GSP treatment. One industrial product, listed in Annex III, had been added as well. Furthermore, the tariff rates of 36 agricultural products under the GSP scheme, listed in Annex IV, had been reduced. As also shown in Annex IV, the tariff rates of 28 industrial products under the GSP had been reduced and 3 ceilings for industrial product groups had been eliminated. He said that his Government hoped that those measures and others, such as the TA activities, would contribute, together with the measures taken by other Members, to the development of the developing countries and the LDCs in particular.","WTCOMTDM45.pdf","WTO, Japan, Japan, GSP, Japan, GSP, GSP, GSP, Members"

The Committee took note of the notification and agreed that, as far as it related to improved market access for LDCs, it would be referred to the Sub-Committee on LDCs for substantive consideration and reporting back according to the reporting procedures agreed to at the 32nd Session of the CTD.","WTCOMTDM45.pdf","Committee, CTD"

The Chairman said that, at the last meeting, the Committee had requested the Secretariat to prepare a legal note regarding the notification procedures for regional trade agreements (RTAs). That note had been prepared by the Legal Affairs Division in cooperation with the regional trade agreements section of the Trade Policy Review Division and the Development Division. The note was before the Committee for consideration in document WT/COMTD/W/114.","WTCOMTDM45.pdf","Chairman, Committee, Secretariat, Trade, Policy, Review, Division, Committee"

"4829",4829,"107","107.    The Secretariat said that it had been asked to examine what the notification requirements for RTAs between developing countries were, where such notifications should be made and whether there were other requirements for regional trade arrangements among developing countries. The expression regional trade arrangements among developing countries was the one used in the Enabling Clause. The note by the Secretariat began by considering the procedural notification requirements for regional trade arrangements among developing countries, from paragraph 18 onwards. The notification of a measure under the Enabling Clause had to be notified to the CONTRACTING PARTIES. CONTRACTING PARTIES, according to the definitions of GATT 1994, referred to WTO Members. Regional trade arrangements between developing countries clearly had to be notified to WTO Members. However, the question was to which WTO body. The Ministerial Conference had been mandated to assign to WTO bodies the functions that had previously been held by the different GATT bodies. The Secretariat note concluded that, although the administration and examination of the Enabling Clause had not been explicitly given to any WTO committee, it seemed that the CTD could be considered the appropriate body to receive such notifications and to consider them first, as was the practice. The second issue examined by the Secretariat note with regard to notifications was when WT/COMTD/M/45 Page 30 such notifications should be made. The Enabling Clause did again not provide a date but did refer to the obligation to notify ""when action was taken"". The note did not elaborate on what the actions relating to regional trade arrangements were before they entered into force. The note simply stated that they should be notified at the latest when they entered into force.","WTCOMTDM45.pdf","Secretariat, Secretariat, GATT, WTO, Members, WTO, Members, WTO, WTO, GATT, Secretariat, WTO, CTD, Secretariat"
"4830",4830,"108","108.     The Secretariat went on to say that, as to which WTO Committee should examine such notifications, its note stated that, in practice, notifications had been sent to the CTD. The general overall power of the CTD to be a focus for developing country issues arguably made it a committee which could examine such notifications and also, as mandated by the Enabling Clause, hold the consultations that could be required by any Member on any Enabling Clause notification. The CTD had the power to hold periodic reviews on anything notified under the Enabling Clause and it also had the power to hold questions and answers on any application of an Enabling Clause provision. Hence, regional trade arrangements could be the subject of consultations and the note simply stated that if consultations were requested, as it is put in the Enabling Clause, such consultations must be held. Arguably, the CTD could handle such consultations although there was no procedure in place at the moment for such questions and answers relating to regional trade arrangements. However, the Committee on Regional Trade Agreements (CRTA) had been created after the CTD, and its mandate, contained in its terms of reference, indicated that it was a specialized WTO body for the examination of RTAs. The first paragraph of the mandate of the CRTA referred to notifications required under the Enabling Clause to the CTD. The mandate of the CRTA thus seemed to recognize the obligation to notify regional trade arrangements among developing countries to the CTD, but gave the CRTA the power to examine such arrangements. The last point made in the note by the Secretariat was that wherever the examination of a regional trade arrangement among developing countries was undertaken, it had to be done according to a mandate by the CTD, prescribing the conditions of the examination. In addition, such an examination could only be undertaken under the relevant applicable law which was the Enabling Clause. The Secretariat note concluded that it might be institutionally efficient and legally coherent to have all regional trade arrangements examined in the CRTA. as the services' aspects of such regional trade arrangements between developing countries would be notified to the Council for Trade in Services which would transfer the notification to the CRTA for examination. That would avoid the clashes and contradictions of having a single regional arrangement examined by the CRTA for its services' aspect and by the CTD for its goods' aspect.","WTCOMTDM45.pdf","Secretariat, WTO, Committee, CTD, CTD, Member, CTD, CTD, Committee, CRTA, CTD, WTO, CRTA, CTD, CRTA, CTD, CRTA, Secretariat, CTD, Secretariat, CRTA, Council, for, Trade, in, Services, CRTA, CRTA, CTD"

He said that he saw no reason not to agree to those conclusions. It was clear that the notifications had to come to the CTD. It was also clear that there was a body which had to examine RTAs and that, if the CTD would itself examine those agreements separately from the CRTA, it would have to create its own procedures. All representatives to the WTO worked within the same institution and delegations normally had one legal counsellor for the different parts of the WTO. Members should therefore have a unity of thinking within individual delegations. He did therefore not see any reason why the examination of RTAs among developing countries should not be delegated to the CRTA, as that was the only procedure which made sense. The CRTA would then have to report back to the CTD. The document was quite clear with respect to when the notifications had to be made. Members should therefore not spend much time on the issue but agree to the conclusions contained in the Secretariat note.","WTCOMTDM45.pdf","Switzerland, Secretariat, Secretariat, CTD, CTD, CRTA, WTO, WTO, Members, CRTA, CRTA, CTD, Members, Secretariat"
"4838",4838,"115","115.     The representative of India said that the Secretariat note had examined the issue of procedures for the notification of RTAs entered into under the Enabling Clause. It appeared to his delegation that the Secretariat thus had examined the issue relating to RTAs under Enabling Clause on a wider canvass than agreed to when the matter was discussed at the last meeting of the CTD. It was his delegation's understanding that the mandate given had been somewhat narrower. He emphasized that the Secretariat note had been prepared on the Secretariat's own responsibility and without prejudice to the positions of Members and their rights and obligations under the WTO. He said that he was not certain about the status of the legal note by the Secretariat. Since Members had only recently received the note which raised a number of substantive issues, his delegation would need to examine it in detail. His delegation would come back with specific comments on the points raised in the Secretariat note, particularly the concluding aspects of the various sections of the note. The Secretariat had mentioned the examination of RTAs notified under the Enabling Clause and some delegations had said that the RTAs among developing countries should be examined in the CRTA. In that context, he drew Members' attention to Paragraph 4(b) of the Enabling Clause which only referred ""prompt consultations"". There was no reference to ""examination"" in the Enabling Clause. He said that there was no need to go into further detail on that issue as his delegation's position was stated in paragraphs 106 and 107 of the minutes of the 44th Session of the CTD.4","WTCOMTDM45.pdf","India, Secretariat, Secretariat, CTD, Secretariat, Secretariat, Members, WTO, Secretariat, Members, Secretariat, Secretariat, CRTA, Members"
"4839",4839,"116","116.     He continued by saying that his delegation believed that the existing procedures with respect to notifications of RTAs under the Enabling Clause were sufficient. There was no need to add new obligations in terms of notification procedures or any review or examination in any other WTO body. He further said that paragraph 60 of the note by the Secretariat stated that ""...it might be institutionally more efficient and legally more coherent for the CRTA to conduct the primary examination of all RTAs, without impairing Members' rights and obligations."" That conclusion went beyond the mandate Members had given the Secretariat in requesting the factual Secretariat note as it prejudged the positions held by Members. There were different views on how to deal with RTAs notified under the Enabling Clause. His delegation was of the view that there was no requirement for any sort of examination of RTAs notified under the Enabling Clause. It was therefore inappropriate to draw such conclusions as those in the note by the Secretariat. He finally said that his delegation had reservations regarding the suggestion made by the delegation of Canada to send the Secretariat note to the Negotiating Group on Rules.","WTCOMTDM45.pdf","WTO, Secretariat, CRTA, Members, Members, Secretariat, Secretariat, Members, Secretariat, Canada, Secretariat"
"4840",4840,"117","117.   The representative of the United States said that his delegation hoped that the Secretariat note would serve as a focus for the Committee's discussion on notifications and reviews of RTAs under the         4             WT/COMTD/M/44 WT/COMTD/M/45 Page 32 Enabling Clause. His delegation joined other delegations and the Secretariat in recognizing the need for all RTAs among all developing countries to be notified to the WTO for a review of such RTAs to be conducted. He encouraged Members to consider how the CTD could cooperate with the CRTA to conduct such reviews. He noted that the question of the relationship between GATT Article XXIV and the Enabling Clause was an issue where there were different views among Members and which was part of an ongoing dialogue in the Negotiating Group on Rules. In that sense, he said that his delegation supported the proposal made by the delegations of Switzerland and Canada to refer the document to the Negotiating Group on Rules for consideration there. However, such a decision might procedurally best be taken in response to a request from the Negotiating Group on Rules. He said that he had one technical point and a follow-up question with respect to the Secretariat note. He agreed with paragraph 4 of the Secretariat's legal analysis that the Enabling Clause applied only to agreements for trade in goods. Further, as noted in paragraph 6 of legal note, the Enabling Clause applied only to regional or global arrangements amongst less-developed countries for mutual reduction or elimination of tariffs and non-tariff measures, on products imported from each other. The Enabling Clause thus only provided special and differential treatment with respect to the internal aspects of the RTA between the parties. He said that his delegation was less certain that it applied to the external aspects of the RTA that affected imports from third parties. Included among such external aspects were the application of a common external tariff or common regulations of commerce that would resolve from a formation of a customs union. He asked what the Secretariat saw as notification requirements that would be applicable to those other external aspects of an agreement that would satisfy the internal aspect with respect to the Enabling Clause, but fall outside its scope with respect to those other matters. Lastly, he said that his delegation had submitted questions to the delegations of India and Sri Lanka, as it had indicated that it would. His delegation looked forward to receiving a formal answer to those questions on the RTA between India and Sri Lanka in the near future.","WTCOMTDM45.pdf","United, States, Secretariat, Committee, Secretariat, WTO, Members, CTD, CRTA, GATT, Members, Switzerland, Canada, Secretariat, Secretariat, RTA, RTA, Secretariat, India, Sri, Lanka, RTA, India, Sri, Lanka"
"4841",4841,"118","118.    The representative of the European Communities said that, on a first reading, his delegation was attracted by the analysis which was close to its own. He said that the Secretariat note was a good point of reference for the Committee's discussion on the question of procedures to follow with respect to RTAs between developing countries. He agreed with the essence of the Secretariat's analysis that the CRTA was empowered by Members to undertake examinations of agreements between developing countries if it was asked to do so by the CTD, and in line with the relevant legal provisions. His delegation was also conscious that the mandate of the Negotiating Group on Rules potentially included that area of work. The document was therefore potentially relevant in that context as well.","WTCOMTDM45.pdf","European, Communities, Secretariat, Committee, Secretariat, CRTA, Members, CTD"
"4842",4842,"119","119.     The representative of Sri Lanka said that the note by the Secretariat had only recently been circulated and his delegation might comment on it at a later occasion, specifically on the concluding paragraphs. With regard to the question raised by the representative of the United States on the FTA between Sri Lanka and India, he recalled that that issue had been discussed and dealt with in detail at previous sessions of the CTD and had been duly notified keeping with Members' obligations. His delegation therefore was of the view that there was no need for the CTD to take up that issue again as his delegation had fulfilled its obligations.","WTCOMTDM45.pdf","Sri, Lanka, Secretariat, United, States, FTA, Sri, Lanka, India, CTD, Members, CTD"

He said that, at the 44th Session, it had been suggested that the Committee invite Secretariat staff servicing negotiating bodies to explain what the different negotiating groups were doing in relation to the development agenda and that one negotiation group be invited at a time. It had been decided that the first presentation would deal with the developmental aspects in the negotiations on agriculture.","WTCOMTDM45.pdf","Chairman, CTD, Committee, Secretariat"
"4849",4849,"125","125.     The Secretariat said that its presentation would summarize the main points in the paper which had been made available to Members. He said that a lot was at stake in the agriculture negotiations, since agriculture in many cases was the backbone of developing country economies. It was therefore not surprising that most, if not all, issues discussed in the agricultural negotiations had a development orientation. One key development issue was the depth of further commitments by developed country Members in the areas of export subsidies and trade-distorting domestic support. Developing country Members were united in demanding that and were clear about what they expected. Core negotiating objectives for developing country Members were large reductions of trade-distorting domestic support and the elimination of export subsidies. That was a precondition for many developing country Members to add momentum to the negotiations on market access. Another developing country concern related to a trend, mainly by developed countries, to switch support from one product to another or from one subsidy category to another, without any tangible liberalizing effect. He said that a number of proposals had been tabled in the Committee on Agriculture, including the Chairman's first draft on modalities, on how to restrict that flexibility. Regarding the issue of market access, he said that most developing countries were in favour of significant improvements in the access to the markets of developed countries. However, when it came to their own participation in the process of reducing protection, developing country Members' interests differed. That was due to a variety of reasons which depended on how they perceived the short-term competitiveness of their agricultural sector as well as how they believed it would evolve in the long run.","WTCOMTDM45.pdf","Secretariat, Members, Members, Members, Members, Members, Committee, on, Agriculture, Chairman, Members"
"4850",4850,"126","126.     He went on to say that the issue of S&D was undisputed, however there was a wide divergence of positions regarding the type of S&D to be provided. In addition to the traditional S&D in the form of lower reduction rates and longer implementation periods, developing country Members were seeking enhanced S&D, particularly in the areas of domestic support and market access. The modality paper by the Chairman of the Committee on Agriculture contained a number of ideas in that regard, for instance, the concept of special products. He said that the effectiveness of the instruments contained in the Marrakesh Decision on Net Food-Importing Developing Countries was an important implementation matter related to the Agreement on Agriculture. The main concern was that LDCs and Net Food-Importing Developing Countries (NFIDCs) had faced and could face in the future, WT/COMTD/M/45 Page 34 higher food import bills as a result of export subsidy reductions. Various proposals had been made to establish a revolving fund to cushion the impact of price shocks but those proposals had so far failed to convince the donor community. Discussions on how to improve the effectiveness of the Marrakesh Decision were ongoing. He said that, at the General Council meeting on Coherence on 13 May 2003, Horst Köhler, Managing Director of the IMF had confirmed that the IMF would consider the concerns of the NFIDCs and LDCs when reviewing the Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility and the Compensatory Finance Facility during that year.","WTCOMTDM45.pdf","Members, Chairman, Committee, on, Agriculture, Marrakesh, General, Council, Horst, Köhler, Director, IMF, IMF, NFIDCs, LDCs, Compensatory, Finance, Facility"
"4851",4851,"127","127.     The representative of India thanked the Secretariat for its presentation but said that his delegation had its own views on how development issues were being dealt with in the Committee on Agriculture. However, that was something that his delegation had taken up in that forum. He said that the Secretariat's observation with respect to developing country Members' reticence to open up their own markets was factually correct. However, a complete picture was necessary in order to understand why developing countries were so reluctant towards the question of market access. President Blaise Compaore of Burkina Faso had explained, at the meeting of the WTO Trade Negotiations Committee on 10 June 2003, the problems faced by some countries due to the subsidies provided by one major producer for one product and how those subsidies distorted prices on the world market. The reason why developing countries were reluctant to open up their markets was that the market for agricultural products was distorted. He said that more than US $300 billion worth of subsidies provided by the OECD countries for agricultural products were a major cause for the distortion in agricultural trade. Developing countries could not be expected to liberalise their agricultural markets unless that problem was satisfactorily addressed.","WTCOMTDM45.pdf","India, Secretariat, Committee, on, Agriculture, Secretariat, Members, Blaise, Compaore, Burkina, Faso, WTO, Trade, Negotiations, Committee, US, OECD"
"4852",4852,"128","128.    The representative of Indonesia said that the Secretariat was correct in saying that the negotiations on agriculture were important to developing country Members. There was no doubt that the agricultural negotiations needed to rectify the current imbalances of the existing Agreement on Agriculture. The Uruguay Round had allowed developed country Members to protect their rich farmers from the impact of trade liberalisation whilst at the same time poor farmers in developing countries were left to fend for themselves with the increasing pressure of trade liberalisation. Contrary to the farmers in the OECD countries who received billions of US dollars in support, Indonesian farmers, who received minimal or no domestic support, were only protected from the influx of artificially cheap agricultural products by an average tariff rate of 8.4 per cent. He said that he agreed with the representative of India that the objective of any agreed modalities on agriculture should include a commitment to fundamental reform of domestic support and export subsidies by those Members that were responsible for those distortions. During discussions in the Special Session of the Committee on Agriculture, his delegation had reiterated the importance of ensuring that reform resulted in fair agricultural trade from which developing countries could reap the benefits. Developing countries were fully committed to agricultural trade reform as stipulated in Article 20 of the Agreement on Agriculture. However, that reform process needed to ensure fair agricultural trade which meant that the concerns of developing countries, particularly food security, growth, development and other S&D provisions had to be taken into account.","WTCOMTDM45.pdf","Indonesia, Secretariat, Members, Uruguay, Round, Members, OECD, India, Members, Committee, on, Agriculture"

"4854",4854,"13","13.     Mr. Ismail, JAG, Chairman said that the JAG had held its Thirty-sixth Session from 28 April to 2 May 2003. In their opening remarks to the JAG, both the Secretary General of UNCTAD and the Deputy Director-General of the WTO had commended ITC on its performance in 2002 and had congratulated the ITC Executive Director on his reappointment for another term. They had noted that the collaboration amongst the three organizations had continued to thrive and that the ITC had an increasingly important contribution to make to supporting development through trade. In his statement to the Group, the Executive Director had highlighted ITC's achievements in 2002 and had spoken of his vision for ITC's future development. The year 2002 had been a good one and ITC's performance was largely due to the positive response of its donors and to the enthusiasm of its staff. It intended to build on the year's achievements to assert its relevance, to continue the process of change, and to grow as a niche player in trade-related technical assistance (TRTA). The plan for growth rested on three principles: the first was for ITC to remain focused and to continue to do what WT/COMTD/M/45 Page 4 it did best; the second was to continue to innovate in technical assistance (TA) approaches and programmes; and the third was to work towards greater field-level impact. ITC had matured into a lean and confident organisation on the eve of its 40th anniversary in 2004. The JAG had reviewed the Annual Report on ITC's activities in 2002 and the report of the Consultative Committee on the ITC Global Trust Fund. The Group congratulated ITC on a productive year and on the quality of the documentation before it. The relevance of ITC's overall approach to TRTA and the Executive Director's strategy for growth had been acknowledged and the ITC had been encouraged to continue its efforts to strengthen the trade and development relationship. The JAG had highlighted the importance of TRTA to the integration of developing and transition economies into the multilateral trading system in the context of the Doha Development Agenda. Representatives had underscored the importance of UNCTAD, WTO and ITC continuing to work together to ensure a coherent and comprehensive approach and the Joint Integrated Technical Assistance Programme to Selected Least- Developed and Other African Countries (JITAP) was cited as a model of effective institutional collaboration and efficient field delivery. Another subject discussed under other business at the JAG Session was the proposal by the delegation of Denmark, for an independent, external evaluation of ITC. The purpose of such an evaluation would be to determine how ITC's role in TRTA could be enhanced. The JAG had agreed that a core group, composed of a small number of donors and beneficiaries, would define the needs and relevance of such an evaluation, determine its scope, clarify the processes and its management, decide on a time frame and agree on the output of the exercise and on what would happen once the report was issued. That core group would liaise on an ongoing basis with a broader consultation group. All interested stakeholders should contact the delegation of Denmark with respect to participation in the evaluation exercise. Before concluding, he also mentioned that, at the Thirty-sixth Session of the JAG, as was the practice each year, government representatives had announced, confirmed or indicated possible voluntary contributions to ITC. In that context and on behalf of the JAG, he said that he wished to express thanks to the Governments of Canada, Denmark, Finland, France, India, Ireland, Italy, Netherlands, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland, United Kingdom, and the United States. He said that his oral report covered the main issues discussed during the Thirty-sixth JAG Session and that he, and the Executive Director of the ITC, were happy to respond to any questions from Members.","WTCOMTDM45.pdf","Ismail, JAG, Chairman, UNCTAD, Director-General, WTO, ITC, ITC, Director, ITC, Group, Director, ITC, ITC, ITC, ITC, TA, ITC, ITC, Consultative, Committee, ITC, Global, Trust, Fund, Group, ITC, ITC, TRTA, Director, ITC, TRTA, Doha, Development, Agenda, UNCTAD, WTO, ITC, Joint, Integrated, Technical, Assistance, Programme, Denmark, ITC, ITC, Denmark, ITC, Canada, Denmark, Finland, France, India, Ireland, Italy, Netherlands, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland, United, Kingdom, United, States, Director, ITC, Members"

The representative of the European Communities said that the presentation by the Secretariat gave Members a good opportunity to discuss the objective of having sustainable development appropriately reflected in the ongoing negotiations, as provided for in paragraph 51 of the Doha Ministerial Declaration. He suggested that, at the next meeting, the Committee deal with the developmental aspects in the area of non-agricultural market access. In the context of export                                                                                    WT/COMTD/M/45                                                                                           Page 35 subsidies, he said that the Secretariat paper on agriculture had failed to make reference to export credits although there was wide agreement on the need for their elimination. With respect to the erosion of preferences, he said that the paper stated that some of the defensive positions taken by developing countries with respect to market access were the function of the time horizon. However, his understanding was that developing country Members' views on the issue of market access depended on more than just the question of timing. His delegation had proposed a number of measures in favour of developing countries' access to developed country markets. His delegation believed that, a commitment should be made by developed countries at the Fifth Ministerial Conference to provide duty free and quota free access for all imports from LDCs. Developed countries needed to ensure zero duty access for developing country exports for no less that 50 per cent of developed country imports. His delegation had also put forward a proposal to reduce tariff escalation on products of particular interest to developing countries. With respect to the defensive interest of developing countries towards market access, his delegation believed that the modalities should allow developing countries to assume lower reduction commitments and longer implementation periods to facilitate the implementation of those commitments. He said that the question of excessive rates of inflation needed to be addressed in the negotiations on agriculture to avoid economies with excessive inflation rates from suffering. Increased TA was also needed to provide sustainable economic development. His delegation was in favour of a certain degree of flexibility in relation to domestic support measures, the de minimis clause and was also in favour of a safeguard instrument that would protect key food security crops in developing countries. His delegation believed that those proposals should be included in the modalities on agriculture as they addressed the general goal of the development agenda.","WTCOMTDM45.pdf","European, Communities, Secretariat, Members, Committee, Secretariat, Members"
"4856",4856,"131","131.    The Secretariat said that the point it had attempted to make in the paper when referring to the time horizon was that protection could possibly have short term benefits but that there were long term costs with protection. Those included costs to the consumers, the taxpayers and the exporters that used the protected products as inputs into goods that they would later export.","WTCOMTDM45.pdf","Secretariat"
"4857",4857,"132","132.     The Chairman said that the issue of agriculture was a key element in the ongoing negotiations. He said that agriculture was the cornerstone for the stability and social cohesion of some countries which were heavily dependent on agriculture. Although the issue of agriculture was dealt with in other WTO bodies, it was important for the CTD to keep its course set on the developmental aspects of agriculture. That should motivate developed and developing country Members to consider how to enhance the integration of developing countries into the multilateral trading system and to find solutions to the challenges in the area of agriculture. He said that if Members agreed, the Committee would continue to consider the mandate given in paragraph 51 of the Doha Ministerial Declaration at future meetings. He said that Tunisia was a country where the agricultural dimension was fundamental. The Governments of Tunisia and the European Communities had a special partnership in which agricultural was an important component. He reiterated the importance of agriculture for both Member countries in the North and in the South. He said that he had intended to invite Members to make proposals on how the agenda item on sustainable development could be dealt with and asked if the Committee could agree to the suggestion by the representative of the European Communities, that the next presentation relating to paragraph 51 of the Doha Ministerial Declaration relate to the developmental aspects of the negotiations on non- agricultural market access.","WTCOMTDM45.pdf","Chairman, WTO, CTD, Members, Members, Committee, Tunisia, Tunisia, European, Communities, Member, North, South, Members, Committee, European, Communities"

The Chairman said that, at the last meeting, the Committee had had before it document WT/COMTD/W/110 containing a description of the work that had been carried out on electronic commerce (e-commerce) in the CTD. That document showed that the CTD had been active in the area of e-commerce and had carried out an extensive educational process on issues relating to e- commerce and development. However, Members had not made any specific suggestions on how to build on that work. That might have been the result of Members being busy with preparations for the Fifth Ministerial Conference in Cancún. He invited Members to make suggestions on how the CTD could carry forward its work on e-commerce. He said that e-commerce referred to the practical application of new technologies in the area of information and communication and that it was important to ensure that activities being carried out in the international community reverberated in the discussions on e-commerce in the CTD. He made reference to the World Summit on the Information Society, the first phase of which would be held in Geneva in December 2003, and the second phase of which would be held in Tunisia in November 2005. He said that new information and communication technologies might constitute a solution to narrowing the digital and social divide between the North and the South. Such Summits should also seek to ensure that new information and communication technology worked for the benefit of trade and development by ensuring that a practical application in trade could contribute to sustainable development.","WTCOMTDM45.pdf","Chairman, Committee, CTD, CTD, Members, Members, Cancún, Members, CTD, CTD, Information, Society, Geneva, Tunisia, South"

The representative of Tunisia informed Members that UNCTAD, together with the Government of Tunisia, was organising an African Ministerial Conference on the Strategies of Electronic Commerce in Development which would be held on 19-21 June 2003 in Tunis. That event would give African representatives from the Government, the private sector, the civil society, regional, international, as well as non-governmental organisations the opportunity to discuss different aspects of new technologies and e-commerce and would contribute to define a programme of action to apply new technologies to ensure sustainable development. That Conference would also deal with the role of e-commerce in Africa and how to draw up policies and strategies for the enhanced contribution of e-commerce to regional integration and development. A draft declaration was being finalised by the African Group at UNCTAD. That declaration would constitute the basis for a plan of action to improve African countries' access to information and communication technology infrastructure within the framework of the preparations for the World Summit on the Information Society which would be held in two phases. One in Geneva in December 2003 and the second in Tunis in November 2005.","WTCOMTDM45.pdf","Tunisia, Members, UNCTAD, Tunisia, Strategies, of, Electronic, Commerce, in, Development, Tunis, Africa, African, Group, UNCTAD, Information, Society, Geneva, Tunis"
"4861",4861,"136","136.    The Chairman said that two similar regional Conferences would be held: one for Asia in Bangkok, Thailand, and another for Latin American and Caribbean countries. He reminded Members that paragraph 34 of the Doha Ministerial Declaration instructed the General Council to consider the most appropriate institutional arrangements for handling the Work Programme on Electronic Commerce and to report on further progress to the Fifth Session of the Ministerial Conference. Pursuant to that, the General Council had agreed, at its meeting in October 2002, to maintain the current institutional arrangements for handling the Work Programme on Electronic Commerce, namely that the Council for Trade in Services, the Council for Trade in Goods, the TRIPS Council and the CTD examine and report on aspects of e-commerce relevant to their respective areas of competence. He suggested that the Secretariat be asked to draft a brief factual report summarizing the Committee's work on e-commerce since the Doha Ministerial Conference including references to the relevant parts of the reports of the meetings at which the issue was discussed and that the Committee adopt that report on a non-objection basis. He said that Members would have five days to forward their comments to the Secretariat after they had received the draft. The report would then be forwarded to the General Council if no major substantive comments were made.

The Chairman said that, as had been agreed when the Agenda was adopted, he would take up the issue of updating the Committee's Annual Report to the General Council under ""Other Business"". Members would recall that the General Council, at its meeting on 10 February 2003, had addressed the issue of the preparation of the annual report that the General Council was to submit to the Cancún Ministerial Conference. It had been then agreed that the General Council would submit to the Ministerial Conference a brief update to its annual report for 2002 which would describe developments since December 2002. He clarified that that only referred to the routine annual reports of a factual nature that all WTO bodies were required to make under existing procedures, and not any specific reports that Ministers at the Doha Ministerial Conference had requested be submitted to them. The intention was that the Ministerial Conference would have before it, as the annual report of the General Council, a compilation of the 2002 Annual Reports of all the WTO bodies, together with updated reports concerning developments in 2003. He therefore suggested that the Committee ask the Secretariat to update the CTD's Annual Report for 2002, so that it covered the work of the Committee since the 2002 report. He further suggested that the Committee adopt that report on a non-objection basis, namely that Members would have five days to comment on the draft report once the Secretariat had made it available to them, and that, if there were no major substantive comments, it be forwarded to the General Council.","WTCOMTDM45.pdf","Chairman, Committee, General, Council, Members, General, Council, General, Council, Cancún, Ministerial, Conference, General, Council, WTO, General, Council, WTO, Committee, Secretariat, CTD, Committee, Committee, Members, Secretariat, General, Council"

ITC's contribution entailed projects to assist the concerned Member Governments' efforts to enhance the training of their trade negotiators.

First, the good implementation of ITC's 2002 work plan based on proximity and operationality which had led to remarkable results and satisfaction on the part of all partners. Second, the priority accorded to projects in developing countries and least-developed countries (LDCs) to strengthen their export diversification capacity and to promote their products in different world markets through the important tools developed by the ITC. That had also been done through innovative programmes such as the Integrated Framework (IF), the JITAP and the World Trade Net. Both the beneficiaries and the donors had confidence in the ITC. The ITC should therefore be encouraged through constant and diversified support to continue its activities in favour of developing countries and LDCs.","WTCOMTDM45.pdf","Mauritania, ITC, ITC, ITC, ITC, LDCs"

He only wished to recognize that the ITC remained true to its vocation and that with scarce resources it made major efforts to support development through various programmes. ITC's work in 2002, as summed-up in the Annual Report,                                                                                     WT/COMTD/M/45                                                                                             Page 5 demonstrated its commitment to the goal of sustainable development. In particular, the intensified support for the relationship between trade and development, implemented through the new programme for poverty reduction through exports, the successful completion of the first phase of the JITAP and the intention to proceed to a second stage of the programme, the launching of activities in the context of the programme to promote South-South trade, and the use of ITC's set of competition tools were praiseworthy. In Cuba, the ITC had provided support in the field of information, capacity building and advisory services, in particular to the Centre for Export Promotion, as well as by participating in Cuba's main trade fair in the previous year. His delegation therefore congratulated the ITC and invited it to continue to work in the same spirit in order to come up with the solutions developing countries required.","WTCOMTDM45.pdf","Cuba, ITC, ITC, ITC, Cuba, ITC, Cuba, ITC"

His delegation supported the statements made by Mr. Ricupero, Secretary General of UNCTAD and Dr. Rana, Deputy Director-General of the WTO, on the importance of enhanced cooperation between the ITC, UNCTAD and WTO. He therefore welcomed the recent formal arrangements between those three organizations. His delegation congratulated the ITC for its focused activities and innovative approaches. The ITC had worked with its members to raise the number of activities by about 20 per cent. That was a respectful percentage and the increase in ITC's activities was welcome. His delegation also welcomed the proposal by the delegation of Denmark to evaluate the ITC. He said that his delegation wished to be part of the core group as well as the broader consultation group for that evaluation.

His delegation requested the ITC to strengthen its activities for the private sector in developing countries through electronic commerce and by enhancing their export capacity. The Government of Morocco and the ITC had hosted a number of joint activities such as the second ""Meet in Africa"" trade in leather exhibition in Casablanca in 2000 and the 3rd World Conference of Trade Promotion Organisations in Marrakech in 2000.

The report, which had been distributed to Members at the end of March, contained an analysis of WTO's TA in 2002 and represented the Technical Cooperation Audit's mandatory annual evaluation to the Committee. He said that the report focused its analysis on the performance of WTO's TA activities from the point of view of their efficiency, effectiveness, relevance and sustainability. In response to the November 2002 debate in the Committee, it also put forward findings, observations and comments on the TA planning process and suggested improvements both in terms of planning and implementation.

"4877",4877,"24","24.     The representative of the United States said that the Technical Cooperation Audit had made a good start in reviewing the activities carried out in 2002. The fact that 481 activities had been implemented indicated that the WTO was strongly committed to trade capacity building. It was an outstanding achievement in light of the number of activities implemented in 2001. Nevertheless, her delegation agreed with the report that there should be less emphasis on the quantity of activities and more on their quality. She said that she was comfortable with the idea discussed in informal sessions of aiming for more sustainable TA activities. That could be achieved by targeted programmes which clearly addressed the needs of developing countries. The emphasis on the number of projects implemented could detract from the ability to deliver quality projects. Her delegation welcomed that the Technical Cooperation Audit helped Members consider those issues. Her delegation also agreed with the Technical Cooperation Audit that the higher quality programmes involved larger and longer term initiatives than the short term, small scale activities on which WTO Members had tended to focus in the last couple of years. It was important to ensure that participants in past projects could build upon the knowledge they had gained to move forward. Consistent with the Technical Cooperation Audit, her delegation recognized that the evaluation of activities carried out was an important part of Members' work. That evaluation had to be an ongoing exercise of which the current audit was a beginning. However, her delegation wished to see the Technical Cooperation Audit improved in the future. Her delegation was willing to work with the Secretariat to explore other approaches to evaluation. It was clear that resources were needed to carry out evaluations and that there was a tension between the attempt to focus on the programming, administration and management and future planning. Her delegation wished to be actively engaged in the Technical Cooperation Audit by considering how to improve it, possibly by engaging an independent audit, and considering how to get resources for it.","WTCOMTDM45.pdf","United, States, Technical, Cooperation, Audit, WTO, Members, WTO, Members, Members, Technical, Cooperation, Audit, Secretariat"
"4878",4878,"25","25.     The representative of Switzerland said that his delegation appreciated the Technical Cooperation Audit Report as it was concise and contained good recommendations. Several of those recommendations were common sense recommendations, but it was important to consider how they could be implemented. The Technical Cooperation Audit Report confirmed what his delegation had expressed since 2002, namely that the emphasis should be on better structured long-term programmes rather than short workshops and ad hoc activities. His delegation wished to see the design of multi-year programmes for specific sectors, countries or regions for Members to approve. Such programmes had to stay within the specific functions of the WTO which were to assist Member Governments interpret the WTO framework and better manage the rules. A possible risk was that multi-year programmes of TA would expand into intensive capacity building and institutional development programmes. Those tasks however had to be dealt with elsewhere, such as in the context of the IF or JITAP. Of the practical recommendations contained in the Technical Cooperation Audit Report, he recalled that the needs-assessments had to be done more carefully, using all available                                                                                     WT/COMTD/M/45                                                                                             Page 7 resources including WTO staff, other delegations and Trade Policy Reviews. The definition of needs should not rely exclusively on questionnaires and affirmed needs by governments. It was also important to set clear objectives and benchmarks for any training to be delivered, even if those objectives and benchmarks were limited. It would otherwise be impossible to evaluate the programmes. Work was also needed to standardize training tools and time and resources had to be invested in the selection of staff and consultants as trainers. The delivery of TA was a complex task and a quality culture of TA had to emerge at the WTO, which was not primarily a technical cooperation delivery organization. The present system of basing the Technical Cooperation Audit Reports on self-evaluation was the best that could be done. However, his delegation wished the Technical Cooperation Audit to carry out more direct interventions. He said that he was surprised that only 15 out of 481 had been directly evaluated by the Technical Cooperation Audit. That number had to increase. His delegation favoured a stronger technical cooperation evaluation unit with the ability to carry out more comprehensive tasks. The WTO should in the longer-term become the centre for knowledge and quality control of TRTA rather than actually delivering direct TA. The WTO could, in the future, evaluate the TRTA activities carried out by other institutions.","WTCOMTDM45.pdf","Switzerland, Members, WTO, Member, WTO, WTO, WTO, Technical, Cooperation, Audit, WTO, WTO"
"4879",4879,"26","26.      The representative of Norway said that the Technical Cooperation Audit Report was a valuable document which did not only describe the activities implemented in 2002 but also referred to improvements that could be made in the evaluation work itself. Her delegation expected that action would be taken according to those recommendations. One such recommendation was that the evaluation should include all activities and that the evaluation feed-back mechanism should be improved. Members had received the Technical Cooperation Audit Report in the first quarter of 2003 as promised. However, her delegation recommended that the discussion of the report be held in the first quarter of the year in the future, or as quickly as possible after the circulation of the document. The reason was that her delegation believed that the Technical Cooperation Audit Report could be a useful tool for Member Governments whose budgetary processes for coming years included reporting on how the budgetary means had been used and the effects of the activities in the preceding years. Her Government had used the 2002 Technical Cooperation Audit Report in the preparation of its 2004 budget. However, her Government would have preferred that the Technical Cooperation Audit Report had first been considered by the CTD. Her delegation had, on several occasions, raised the question of making all WTO TA activities part of the regular budget. In that context she referred to paragraph 21 in the Technical Cooperation Audit Report which stated that ""The plan lives and dies from one year to the next. Therefore, the cumulative benefits of the current TAs for the beneficiaries are more the result of coincidence than systematically thought out efforts."" That should provide food for thought. The WTO/OECD Doha Development Agenda Trade Capacity Building Database aimed at increasing coordination among donors. However, Members also had to consider better coordinated TA in a longer time perspective. That was also true for the work carried out by the WTO Secretariat.","WTCOMTDM45.pdf","Norway, Members, Member, CTD, WTO, Technical, Cooperation, Audit, Report, Members, WTO, Secretariat"
"4880",4880,"27","27.     The representative of the European Communities said that he agreed with much of what the three previous speakers had said with respect to the Technical Cooperation Audit Report. His delegation appreciated the positive nature of the overall evaluation exercise and recognized that it was a new tool that had been introduced in 2002. As the Secretariat itself had stated, it could and should be improved in future years as experience in its application was gained. The evaluation process would assist Members ensure continued quality improvement of WTO TA activities and their sustainability. That should lead to a higher proportion of planned and structured activities rather than ad hoc and small scale activities. The lessons that could be learned from what had been done in 2002 should be applied in the design of the activities for 2003 and when monitoring and evaluating them. His delegation was interested in exploring the idea suggested by the Secretariat in the Technical Cooperation Audit Report for a multi-annual perspective to planning. The representative of Norway had mentioned that that might have budgetary implications. However, his delegation believed that longer term planning had the potential to ensure that Members were working on a more structured and sustainable basis in the design and delivery of activities. Another point suggested by the Secretariat, but which his delegation was less enthusiastic about, was the idea of WTO field presence. His WT/COMTD/M/45 Page 8 delegation saw the role of the WTO as being the quality controller from the centre, delivering a relatively limited number of activities in areas where it was the undeniable specialist and ensuring the quality of other activities relating to the WTO carried out by regional partners. Finally, he asked how the Secretariat intended to organize the evaluation of the activities carried out in 2003 and beyond, in light of the reorganization of the Secretariat.","WTCOMTDM45.pdf","European, Communities, Secretariat, Members, WTO, Secretariat, Norway, Members, Secretariat, WTO, WTO, WTO, Secretariat, Secretariat"
"4881",4881,"28","28.      The representative of Mauritius said that the Technical Cooperation Audit Report came at an opportune time about midway in the work of the Doha Development Agenda. It was useful to stop and consider what had been done and that was exactly what the Technical Cooperation Audit Report did. The approach taken by the Technical Cooperation Audit in its report was commendable. That was true for its coverage, both country and substance-wise. The kind of cross-sectional approach taken was plausible as it covered a number of countries and regions. His Government had been happy to receive the former head of the WTO Technical Cooperation Audit in Mauritius while he was undertaking part of the 2002 Audit. His delegation believed that the Technical Cooperation Audit Report comprehensively covered the evaluation approach based on the four pillars of efficiency, effectiveness, relevance and sustainability. Most activities had been delivered in the area of services. That was logical as the services sector was poised to play an ever increasing role in the economies of developing countries. He suggested that that momentum be kept and even that the TA related to the services sector be given more attention in the future. The evaluation made by the Chairperson of the Special Session of the Council for Trade in Services had shown that the number of requests and offers made by Members in the area of services was limited. Developing country Members needed assistance to evaluate the existing offers and proceed to submit offers themselves. The successes and shortcomings in terms of the efficiency of the TA delivered was a shared responsibility of the beneficiaries, the donors and the Secretariat. There had been some problems with developing country participants who had not been able to dedicate themselves fully to participate in the activities. That message had to go back to developing country Governments. Participants had to be able to devote themselves to participate fully in any activity proposed so that the most was made of the opportunities presented by WTO TA. On the other hand, there had also been problems of interpretation. Participants had not been able to take full advantage of activities delivered in languages they were not fluent in. That was something that needed to be rectified as soon as possible. Interpretation was important and unless participants were given the opportunity to fully understand the content of the courses it would be difficult for them to absorb the information.","WTCOMTDM45.pdf","Mauritius, Doha, Development, Agenda, Technical, Cooperation, Audit, WTO, Technical, Cooperation, Audit, Mauritius, Chairperson, Council, for, Trade, in, Services, Members, Members, Secretariat, WTO"
"4882",4882,"29","29.      He went on to say that he appreciated the comments made with respect to relevance. The activities carried out had been relevant and focussed. The Technical Cooperation Audit Report mentioned that there was a link between relevance and sustainability of TA activities. Sustainability was not only about ensuring that TA was provided. It was also related to the long-term impact of the TA delivered. The long-term sustainability of TA activities required additional efforts. The ability of the people trained to transmit their knowledge to others had to be part of the goal of long term sustainability. The part of the Technical Cooperation Audit Report containing lessons learned was good. TA delivery was not only a question of quantity but rather a question of quality. Quality and excellence was a continuum and the Technical Cooperation Audit Report was an important tool in ensuring a high quality of the TA delivered. He suggested that the Technical Cooperation Audit Report remain an integral feature of WTO TA.","WTCOMTDM45.pdf","WTO"

The Chairman said that, at the last meeting of the Committee, Members had agreed to revert to the election of the Chairperson of the Committee on Trade and Development (CTD) at the beginning of the 45th Session. He said that, as had been mentioned at the meeting of the General Council on 15 May 2003, the informal consultations that he had undertaken on behalf of the Chairman of the General Council had led him to believe that there was consensus for the Committee to elect Ambassador Habib Mansour of Tunisia as the next Chairperson of the CTD in Regular and Dedicated Sessions.","WTCOMTDM45.pdf","Chairman, Committee, Members, Chairperson, Committee, on, Trade, and, Development, General, Council, Chairman, General, Council, Committee, Ambassador, Habib, Mansour, Tunisia, Chairperson, CTD"
"4884",4884,"30","30.     The Secretariat said that it wished to respond to the question posed by the representative of the European Communities regarding the Secretariat's plans for the Technical Cooperation Audit. The Training Institute had been merged with the Technical Cooperation Division and Mr. Paul Rolian had been assigned the directorship of the new Institute for Training and Technical Cooperation (ITTC). The Technical Cooperation Audit was currently staffed on a temporary basis and the Secretariat was in the process of identifying a new director for it. The Secretariat had wished to strengthen the Technical Cooperation Audit. However, Members had not approved the necessary additional staff resources for 2003. The six additional posts received had been needed in the                                                                                    WT/COMTD/M/45                                                                                            Page 9 operational divisions because of the ongoing negotiations. Nevertheless, he was hopeful that additional resources could be allocated to the Technical Cooperation Audit in the future. Informal discussions were undertaken with donors in the search for a solution to the issue. Mr. Paul Rolian had moved, with his post, to the ITTC so there was unfortunately no empty post in the Technical Cooperation Audit. That made it difficult for the Secretariat to find a solution to the directorship of the Technical Cooperation Audit. However, the Secretariat considered the directorship of the Technical Cooperation Audit to be an important position and a director would soon be nominated. Some further restructuring of the Secretariat might also take place because of retirements. He concluded by saying that he considered the Technical Cooperation Audit to be playing the role it was intended to play.","WTCOMTDM45.pdf","Secretariat, Secretariat, Technical, Cooperation, Audit, Training, Institute, Technical, Cooperation, Division, Paul, Rolian, Institute, for, Training, and, Technical, Cooperation, Secretariat, Secretariat, Members, Technical, Cooperation, Audit, Paul, Rolian, ITTC, Secretariat, Secretariat, Secretariat"
"4885",4885,"31","31.      The representative of the Philippines said that the Technical Cooperation Audit was an important function that Members had to consider in light of the scare resources available in the technical cooperation budget. Her delegation welcomed that the report of the Technical Cooperation Audit was detailed. The Technical Cooperation Audit Report pointed out areas that needed improvement. She said that she wished to assure the donors that the participants to the short and long term TA activities had benefited from and appreciated the TA provided. There would always be a trade-off between quality and quantity. Speaking about the experience of her Government she said that not all ministries in the Philippines were fully aware of what the WTO was. The short-term courses and information seminars clearly served the purpose of increasing awareness of various Government officials about the WTO Agreements and its implications to national government policies. While the long term trade policy courses were useful, it was always difficult to release staff for a long time. Her Government was still awaiting the implementation of a few national short term courses it had identified. She agreed with the report that the effectiveness of the regional courses was unknown although she realized that courses were being carried out at the regional level in an attempt to maximize the use of the limited resources. Her delegation agreed with the evaluation approach based on the four pillars, i.e. efficiency, effectiveness, relevance and sustainability. In terms of efficiency she said that the Philippine participants in WTO TA activities had all commended the WTO lecturers for their efficiency. Effectiveness was difficult to measure. It depended to a large extent on the person participating in an activity. The content of the activities in which Philippine officials had participated had been relevant. She said that sustainability was an area that she believed could be improved. She said that she agreed with what had been said by other delegations that the donors, beneficiaries and the Secretariat had to work together to ensure that the delivery of WTO TA became more effective for all beneficiaries.","WTCOMTDM45.pdf","Philippines, Members, Philippines, WTO, WTO, WTO, WTO, Secretariat, WTO"
"4886",4886,"32","32.      The representative of Australia said that the Technical Cooperation Audit Report was an important and overall useful document. However, her delegation wished to offer some detailed comments with a view to enhancing its utility even further. She agreed with other delegations that there were issues that needed to be further explored and that WTO's resource constraints had to be taken into account. The Technical Cooperation Audit Report would have benefited from a clear statement of overall strategic purpose and objective of engaging in TA projects. A way of linking back the specific objectives for individual projects to such an overall purpose would be desirable. The information presented in the Technical Cooperation Audit Report should be made as comprehensive as possible and a clear effort had been made in that regard. Her delegation wished to see more structured and tabulated information. One example was the statement in paragraph 8 of the Report that the number of reports received in the Audit was lower than the total number of TA activities for which an evaluation was due. However, no overall quantification was available. The Technical Cooperation Audit had the capacity to provide more structured information through the use of the existing database from which data could be retrieved and analyzed. Her delegation wished to see an increase in qualitative indicators such as for example an assessment of the most commonly nominated strengths and weaknesses in project evaluations. A summary of the 15 projects subject to on-site assessment could be presented, rather than just the names of the projects. Her delegation wished to see more evidence for some of the statements made. Although there was no reason to doubt the WT/COMTD/M/45 Page 10 information provided, statements such as ""Teaching skills of TA providers have certainly been enhanced through participation in the training-of-trainers courses..."" in paragraph 19 could be further elaborated. Another concern of her delegation related to the lack of reporting on collaborative projects with other organizations. That issue should also be considered in the context of outsourcing. The reporting of the external evaluations should be as extensive as possible. She suggested that summaries of those evaluations might be provided. The four principles of evaluation used by the Technical Cooperation Audit were sound. The approach of universal self-evaluation followed by a resource-constrained sample of independent evaluations was reasonable. However, that methodology could be improved. Generally improving the design and evaluation of individual projects had been identified as an area requiring further work. Her delegation believed that that work should be prioritized.","WTCOMTDM45.pdf","Australia, WTO, Technical, Cooperation, Audit"
"4887",4887,"33","33.      The representative of Mauritania said that his delegation appreciated the evaluation of TA activities. It was important to critically examine WTO's TA activities and identify their strengths and weaknesses in order to improve them. The current internal Technical Cooperation Audit should in the future be supplemented by an external audit. He said that he would limit his intervention to comments on the methodology and the approach. There was a problem of approach and methodology that was linked to the fact that an evaluation of WTO's TA could not be dissociated from an evaluation of public policies. It was linked to the human resources and ability of governments to define their development policies. That related to the national framework and the constraints it imposed. Second, the indicators used was another important aspect of the Technical Cooperation Audit Report. Paragraph 34 of the Report was honest in admitting that, although the indicators should be clearly stated prior to the implementation of any activity, that was rarely the case in practice. The indicators should also take such factors into account as whether the delivery of TA really improved the notification capacity of the beneficiary Government, whether the beneficiary Government was enabled to participate more actively in the negotiations, whether it was able to better integrate into the multilateral trading system and whether a beneficiary country had developed its export supply capacity. Such indicators were difficult to measure. Nevertheless, the aim should be to enlarge the scope of the Technical Cooperation Audit to consider such larger underlying questions. The WTO Technical Cooperation Audit could in the future be more focused on associating and reconciling quality and quantity of TA and, in that context, it was important to distinguish between the generic and the specific needs of beneficiary governments. The WTO Technical Cooperation Audit could also take the diversity of the current supply of products into account. In addition, it would be useful to associate the beneficiaries with the Audit to a larger extent than was currently done and to refine the methods and tools with which the evaluation was carried out.","WTCOMTDM45.pdf","Mauritania, WTO, WTO, WTO, Technical, Cooperation, Audit, WTO, Technical, Cooperation, Audit"
"4888",4888,"34","34.      The representative of Morocco said that his delegation believed that the Technical Cooperation Audit Report was the best means to ameliorate TA and capacity building. Of the four pillars for the evaluation he said that he wished to refer to the issue of sustainability, which was the most difficult to evaluate. He said that his delegation wished to make a few suggestions in light of the fact that the short term courses had shown their limits. First, the duration of seminars should be prolonged in a systematic fashion. Second, the involvement of universities in developing countries should be strengthened. The regional trade policy courses organized in Africa had shown how valuable such cooperation was. The regional trade policy courses should therefore be maintained. Third, enhanced training of trainers was one the best examples of introducing sustainability of WTO TA. Fourth, the subjects of the training provided could be better targeted to each group of officials trained. Finally, he said that enhanced coordination with other organisations such as UNCTAD was desirable.","WTCOMTDM45.pdf","Morocco, Africa, WTO, UNCTAD"
"4889",4889,"35","35.    The representative of Canada said that the quantity and the value of the comments that had been made by Members on the Technical Cooperation Audit Report demonstrated the interest Members had in it. She said that her delegation also wished to highlight some of the points made in the Report. First, it was important to prioritise and establish guidelines for the selection of activities.                                                                                     WT/COMTD/M/45                                                                                            Page 11 Paragraph 13 of the Report mentioned that the WTO delivered more TA than ever. That indicated an enhanced need to prioritize. It was also important to establish objectives and indicators for each specific activity, as had been mentioned by the representative of Mauritania among others. Her delegation also agreed with the statement in paragraph 33 of the Report that it would be desirable to follow-up the training-of-trainers courses for WTO staff members. The activities undertaken also had to be planned and initiated on the basis of an assessment of the problems and needs identified by the Members, as referred to in paragraph 48 of the Report. She said that it was important to focus on the quality rather than the quantity of assistance in order to enhance the sustainability of the activities. However, she noted the comments made by the representative of the Philippines regarding the usefulness of short term activities and encouraged the Secretariat to take those comments into account, in particular when the beneficiaries were less informed and had not previously benefited from any training in a particular area. She said that her delegation also had some comments and questions with respect to issues not already mentioned. First, in view of the 2004 TA Plan, she asked if the Secretariat intended to ensure a better coordination between the needs identified by Members, whether expressed in the different WTO bodies or in the diagnostic studies undertaken within the IF, and the activities delivered. Her delegation hoped that, with the progressive implementation of the activities in 2003, the executing staff would ensure that evaluations were completed and sent to the ITTC as her delegation had understood that there had been some problems in that respect in 2002. It would also be desirable for WTO's comparative advantage to be examined before any decision was taken to implement any activity in order to ensure that the IF, the JITAP or other programmes were not better suited to implement a given activity. Finally, she requested that the raw data, on which the Report was based, be made available to Members.","WTCOMTDM45.pdf","Canada, Members, Members, WTO, Mauritania, WTO, Members, Philippines, Secretariat, Secretariat, Members, WTO, ITTC, WTO, Members"
"4890",4890,"36","36.      The representative of Rwanda said that his delegation welcomed the Technical Cooperation Audit Report. The activities implemented in 2002 and planned for 2003 demonstrated a real commitment to face the challenge of capacity building. Developing countries could only integrate in the multilateral trading system through a few means such as the training of human resources, the strengthening of national institutions, and the diversification of the productive capacity through the development of the private sector. His Government appreciated the efforts made in that context, even if WTO's TA could be improved even further. His Government was satisfied with the prompt and positive reply the Secretariat had provided to the assistance requested. That proved that the restructuring of the Secretariat was a way of rationalizing the work in order to meet the set objectives. He hoped that his Government would continue to receive enhanced and more structured TA such as that provided through the IF. His delegation encouraged the Secretariat to produce regular reports showing defined objectives, indicators, resources devoted, achievements and outstanding work.","WTCOMTDM45.pdf","Rwanda, WTO, Secretariat, Secretariat, Secretariat"
"4891",4891,"37","37.      The representative of the Kyrgyz Republic said that his Government attached great importance to the participation of officials in TA activities which could lead to a more effective integration of the Kyrgyz Republic in the multilateral trading system. Officials from the Kyrgyz Republic had benefited from the training the countries of the European Union had provided to his Government. He noted from the Report on the implementation of the 2003 TA Plan in the first quarter of 2003 (WT/COMTD/W/112) that the central Asian region, to which the Kyrgyz Republic belonged, lagged behind other regions in terms of activities implemented. That the central Asian region was able to benefit from WTO TA at the regional level was more important than ever as other countries of the region were in the process of acceding to the WTO. The needs of the resource constrained transition economies had been clearly stated in the Doha Development Agenda. He therefore urged the Secretariat and the donors to increase their contributions to enable the countries in the central Asian region to benefit from WTO TA in 2003 and 2004. He also called on the rule setting organisations to take active part in the seminars organized by the WTO in order to increase the quality of the training provided to capital-based officials.","WTCOMTDM45.pdf","Kyrgyz, Republic, Kyrgyz, Republic, Kyrgyz, Republic, European, Union, Kyrgyz, Republic, WTO, WTO, Doha, Development, Agenda, Secretariat, WTO, WTO"
"4892",4892,"38","38.    The Secretariat said that it was its intention to carefully study all the comments made in the Technical Cooperation Audit Report as well as those made by Members. The Secretariat would WT/COMTD/M/45 Page 12 attempt to incorporate as many of them as possible in the future delivery of TA. The kind of changes that many delegations wished to see might not be possible to undertake in the immediate future as their introduction required some time. However, all suggestions would be given due consideration. Members had said that they wished to see the delivery of TA based on quality rather than quantity. That was already part of the Secretariat's thinking. All Members seemed to agree that sustainability was important, although it was a difficult issue. Possibly shifting the balance somewhat from some of the more disparate and short activities traditionally conducted to longer term institutional capacity building might automatically improve the record with respect to sustainability. The Technical Cooperation Audit had repeatedly made the point to Members that the resources devoted to evaluation were inadequate. Several Members had said that they wished to see something more from the Technical Cooperation Audit even if Members recognized that that required more resources. The Technical Cooperation Audit could do more if more resources were given to it. Some Members had supported the idea of a multi-year approach as referred to in the report. However, that also raised the question of resources, although in a different sense as one Member had mentioned, referring to the fact that the resources for TA were on the whole extra budgetary resources and therefore suffered from the unpredictability that accompanied an annual exercise of gathering resources for TA. The budgetisation of TA was an old issue. Nevertheless, if Members wished a multi-year approach to TA, they had to consider its financial implications.","WTCOMTDM45.pdf","Secretariat, Members, Secretariat, Members, Secretariat, Members, Members, Members, Members, Members, Member, Members, TA"
"4893",4893,"39","39.     The Secretariat went on to refer to some of the more specific comments and said that it would be possible to provide more tabular and quantitative information in future reports. The database that had been developed would help in that regard and the Secretariat would attempt to provide more such information. The methodological changes that the Report referred to, and that many Members had supported, would also be introduced. The Technical Cooperation Audit would insist that all TA providers provide feedback from their activities in all instances when the Technical Cooperation Audit could not directly observe an activity. One delegation had mentioned that it was surprised that only 15 activities had been evaluated directly. That too was an issue of resources. The 15 activities directly observed meant more than one trip per month assuming that there were only about ten working months a year. If more was to be done, more staff resources were needed. The Technical Cooperation Audit would otherwise have to rely on self evaluation, which on the whole, the Technical Cooperation Audit believed had produced the results hoped for. Nevertheless, the self evaluations could be further improved and work would be undertaken to that effect. Several delegations had mentioned the needs assessments. The needs assessments were a critical aspect of the planning process. It was linked to the setting of clear objectives which in turn had an impact on the quality of the evaluation. If the objectives were not clearly defined at the outset, it would be unclear for the Technical Cooperation Audit what objectives it was supposed to evaluate an activity against. The Secretariat hoped to improve the 2004 Technical Cooperation Plan in that respect.","WTCOMTDM45.pdf","Secretariat, Secretariat, Members, Technical, Cooperation, Audit, Technical, Cooperation, Audit, Secretariat"

"4897",4897,"42","42.      The representative of the United States said that the Quarterly Report was a valuable tool in examining how the WTO was doing with respect to meeting the objectives of the 2003 TA Plan. She said that her delegation wished to make some suggestions for how to improve the quarterly reports to make them more useful for Member governments, even if she was unsure about how those changes would be made in practice. Several pieces of information were lacking from the Quarterly Report which would be useful to bilateral donors who wished to complement WTO's activities and who                                                                                     WT/COMTD/M/45                                                                                            Page 13 wished to define priorities for the following year. One such piece of information was the actual number of participants in each of the activities. Another was information about the countries represented as participants in regional activities. While she was aware that there was a lag in the process of budgeting versus the planning and implementation of the projects, she said that it would be useful for Members to receive information on the relative cost of the different projects implemented. That was linked to the assessment of the efficiency and effectiveness of different kinds of projects. Such figures would assist Members in getting an idea of the number of participants reached by a certain type of activity and the cost of that activity. Those would thus be useful pieces of information for Members from a management and development standpoint.","WTCOMTDM45.pdf","United, States, WTO, Member, WTO, Members, Members, Members"
"4898",4898,"43","43.      The representative of the European Communities said that his delegation agreed with the suggestions made by the representative of the United States for the inclusion of additional information on the number of participants and additional raw information that would be useful for assessment purposes such as the back-to-office reports. In addition to those suggestions, he said that his delegation wished to make two other points. First, the Secretariat had indicated that, at the end of March, the implementation of the 2003 TA Plan was still below expectations. His delegation shared the wish for the delivery rate to increase and the set targets to be achieved. Six weeks had passed since the end of March. He therefore asked the Secretariat to inform Members about whether the pace of implementation was increasing. It was especially important that some of the training activities relating to the Doha Development Agenda subjects be implemented before the Fifth Ministerial Conference. He said that his second question related to strategic partnerships with other bodies. The Quarterly Report referred to a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with the International Institute for Trade and Development. A WTO press release had also referred to a MoU with UNCTAD. He asked how the WTO would cooperate with those two organisations and what the MoUs would mean in terms of co-financing. The Quarterly Report was an overall positive tool containing useful information in relation to the delivery of the 2003 TA Plan in the first quarter of the year. The Quarterly Report should be seen as a part of the overall steady quality improvement and the management and the provision of information on WTO TA activities.","WTCOMTDM45.pdf","European, Communities, United, States, Secretariat, Secretariat, Members, International, Institute, for, Trade, and, Development, WTO, UNCTAD, WTO, MoUs, WTO"
"4899",4899,"44","44.     The representative of Switzerland said that he wished to ask the same question as had been posed earlier on how the Secretariat believed the rhythm of implementation of the 2003 TA Plan could be improved since it was below target in the first quarter. Second, he had a question relating to the evaluation of TA activities. Paragraph 13 of the Quarterly Report stated that a certain critical mass of activities was necessary in order to assess the implementation. Reference was also made to the 2002 Technical Cooperation Audit (WT/COMTD/W/111 and Corr.1). He therefore asked whether the Secretariat intended to include a section on evaluations in future quarterly reports, evaluations which he assumed would have to be carried out by the Technical Cooperation Audit and not by the ITTC. He further asked how the Secretariat planned the assessment for 2004. He reminded the Secretariat that a number of Members had had problems in approving the 2003 TA Plan as they considered that the 2002 activities had not been evaluated properly. He asked what type of evaluation and assessment would be available to Members at the time when Members would be asked to approve the 2004 TA Plan. An evaluation of the 2003 activities would be necessary in order for Members to take decisions for 2004 based on sound evidence of what would work and what would not work.","WTCOMTDM45.pdf","Switzerland, Secretariat, Corr, Secretariat, ITTC, Secretariat, Secretariat, Members, Members, Members, Members"
"4900",4900,"45","45.      The representative of Mauritania said that his delegation wished to inform Members about the situation with respect to the implementation of activities in Mauritania. His Government considered the situation satisfactory as a national trade policy course had already been held to the benefit of some 30 officials from different ministries concerned with international trade such as the Ministry of Commerce, the Ministry of Agriculture, and the Ministry of Finance. Second, a national seminar on trade and investment benefiting some 30 officials had been held in May 2003. Third, a mission to establish a Reference Centre was currently underway in Mauritania and his Government hoped that a national follow-up seminar would be organized in June 2003 following the results of the Trade Policy WT/COMTD/M/45 Page 14 Review of Mauritania which had been held in September 2002. The implementation rate for activities in Mauritania in the first semester might thus be 100 per cent. However, the low rate of implementation still posed two problems for other WTO Members as well as for the Secretariat. The first was to reconcile the planned activities with Members', and particularly LDC Members', ad hoc requests. It was therefore necessary to ensure a certain flexibility to meet such requests. Second, there was the problem of the increasing cost of the national activities. However, national activities responded to specific needs of the Members. One example was the cost for the interpretation requested by Governments such as his, as many officials in Mauritania worked in Arabic. It would therefore be useful to have interpretation in Arabic for activities in Mauritania and there might be a need for interpretation into other languages for national activities held in other WTO Member countries. He said that the implementation of TA activities for Mauritania was satisfactory and he hoped that it would continue in that manner.","WTCOMTDM45.pdf","Mauritania, Members, Mauritania, Ministry, of, Commerce, Ministry, of, Agriculture, Ministry, of, Finance, Mauritania, Mauritania, Mauritania, WTO, Members, Secretariat, Members, Members, Members, Mauritania, Mauritania, WTO, Member, Mauritania"
"4901",4901,"46","46.      The Secretariat said that it agreed with the suggestions made by the representative of the United States and supported by other delegations regarding how to improve the reporting mechanism. It should be possible to include more information of a factual nature such as the number of participants and the number of countries involved in regional activities in the quarterly reports. The Secretariat would consider including such information in the Second Quarterly Report. The Second Quarterly Report would also include information on the training activities, which for the current meeting had been the subject of a separate paper. The Second Quarterly Report would thus provide delegations with a full picture of all activities carried out in the second quarter in one document. With respect to the costs, the Secretariat was conscious of the fact that the way in which it reported implementation might not be satisfactory in the sense that a three months trade policy course and a one day workshop each counted as one activity implemented. There was something wrong with that way of reporting and the Secretariat was considering how to present that information in a more meaningful way, possibly in terms of staff days involved or cost per participant per day for example. The second main question posed was whether the Secretariat could provide any additional information on the pace of implementation since the end of March 2003. The Secretariat said that it was pleased to report that the pace of implementation had increased considerably since the end of March 2003. In fact, the Secretariat had carried out the same number of activities in the six week period since the end of March 2003 as it had during the first three months. The pace of implementation was clearly accelerating and the Secretariat hoped to accelerate it even further. The implementation would be particularly intensive from then on and leading up to the Fifth Ministerial Conference as all activities linked to the Fifth Ministerial Conference had to be implemented in a timely manner. The implementation rate had been negatively effected by the recent geopolitical and international medical events. However, there was unfortunately nothing the Secretariat could do to change that situation even though such events did have an impact on the TA delivery rate.","WTCOMTDM45.pdf","Secretariat, United, States, Secretariat, Secretariat, Secretariat, Secretariat, Secretariat, Secretariat, Secretariat, Secretariat"
"4902",4902,"47","47.      The Secretariat went on to speak about strategic partnerships and said that it had taken some time to formulate the MoU between UNCTAD and the WTO. That MoU formalized a well functioning relationship that the WTO had had with UNCTAD since a long time back. The MoU formalized that cooperation and clarified the basis for the financing and co-financing of activities. It laid down rules for agreed activities between the two agencies and in particular the responsibilities of the other agency in situations where one agency was the lead agency for a particular activity. Such situations had been clarified and the two agencies had begun to follow the procedures set out in the MoU as of the date of its signature. The Secretariat said that the fourth issue was the question of the content of the quarterly reports and how to make them more evaluative. Members had to be clear about the purpose of the quarterly reports. The quarterly reports were primarily intended to be monitoring reports. They were not intended as reports that would evaluate and assess the effectiveness, relevance and sustainability of the activities implemented. He maintained that the critical mass of activities that was needed for such an evaluation was not available with the around 60 activities carried out each quarter. However, some lessons of particular importance which might be used to adjust the implementation of the remaining activities that year might emerge from some of the                                                                                    WT/COMTD/M/45                                                                                           Page 15 activities implemented. Such lessons would be brought to Members' attention together with information about how the Secretariat intended to deal with them. However, the quarterly reports were not intended as full fledged evaluations. Regarding what information Members would have at the time they would be asked to agree to the 2004 TA Plan, the Secretariat said that it was conscious of the comments that had been made in 2002 in connection with the adoption of the 2003 TA Plan. It believed that when Members would have the draft 2004 TA Plan in front of them they would realize that the Secretariat had given recognition to what Members had said in 2002. The Secretariat was aiming to state clear objectives for the activities included in the 2004 TA Plan. That might make it easier for Members to judge whether what the Secretariat was proposing was reasonable or not. There would be clear differences in the structure of the 2004 TA Plan as compared to the 2003 TA Plan. Regarding the plea for flexibility the Secretariat said that that was something it did keep in mind. Finally, the Secretariat would give due consideration to any requests for interpretation during TA activities.","WTCOMTDM45.pdf","Secretariat, UNCTAD, WTO, WTO, UNCTAD, Secretariat, Members, Members, Secretariat, Members, Secretariat, Members, Secretariat, Members, Secretariat, Members, Secretariat, Secretariat, Secretariat"

The outgoing Chairman said that the incoming Chairperson, before coming to Geneva, had served as Ambassador of Tunisia to Madrid, to Buenos Aires, from where he concurrently was responsible for Chile, and to Kinshasa. Ambassador Mansour's participation in international conferences and intergovernmental negotiations led him to believe that the Membership had chosen a person with wide experience and multifaceted attributes to chair the CTD. Ambassador Mansour's experience in the biodiversity convention negotiations would be of particular value when the CTD considered the question of the development dimension of the relationship between trade and the environment. He said that knowing Ambassador Mansour and being aware of his high reputation and standing, he was confident that he would be an excellent Chair of the Committee.","WTCOMTDM45.pdf","Chairman, Chairperson, Geneva, Ambassador, Tunisia, Madrid, Buenos, Aires, Chile, Kinshasa, Ambassador, Mansour, CTD, Ambassador, Mansour, CTD, Ambassador, Mansour, Committee"
"4906",4906,"50","50.      The Secretariat said that Members had before them document JOB(03)97 which contained four tables. The first two tables presented the situation with respect to pledges made and funds transferred by donors to the Doha Development Agenda Global Trust Fund (DDAGTF). The third table presented a synthesis of all trust funds used to finance TA activities, whether included in the 2003 TA Plan or not. The fourth table summarized all pledges made to all trust funds, including the DDAGTF over the coming four years. Taking into account the pledges made for 2002 which had not been transformed into actual contributions on 1 January 2003, the balance left in the DDAGTF at the end of 2002 and the pledges made for 2003, just over Sw F 19 million were currently pledged to the Doha Development Agenda Global Trust Fund. Pledges made which were earmarked for certain types of activities or certain beneficiaries which could be used to finance activities included in the 2003 TA Plan amounted to an additional Sw F 2 million. That meant that the resources available amounted to Sw F 21 million in total. That was Sw F 3 million short of the Sw F 24 million agreed as the target amount for the DDAGTF in 2003. Turning to the cash situation, he said that the terms of reference of the DDAGTF defined precise thresholds for the disbursement of the contributions. The second threshold stipulated that 75 per cent of the funds should have been received by the end of March 2003. That deadline had been missed by a large margin. Only Sw F 13,2 million had been received by the end of March 2003 which was clearly short of the Sw F 18 million that 75 per cent of Sw F 24 million represented. The third threshold was at the end of June 2003 when all of the Sw F 24 million should be in the bank. As the pledges did not even amount to Sw F 24 million, he said that it seemed unlikely that that threshold would be met. That did not mean that the Secretariat had yet encountered a cash problem. It had a balance of Sw F 3 million in the DDAGTF which was sufficient for some time but certainly not for the Secretariat to ensure the implementation of the 2003 TA Plan until the end of the year.","WTCOMTDM45.pdf","Secretariat, Members, Doha, Development, Agenda, Global, Trust, Fund, Doha, Development, Agenda, Global, Trust, Fund, Secretariat, Secretariat"

"4910",4910,"54","54.     The Chairman said that, at the 44th session of the CTD, the Secretariat had presented a progress report on its ongoing work to explore the possibility of outsourcing more TA activities to outside consultants and to other international and regional organisations. After having offered preliminary information on the modalities for a roster of individual consultants as well as on MoUs for effective and coherent partnerships, the Secretariat had indicated that a more comprehensive document on outsourcing would be circulated before the next meeting of the Committee. At the same session, the Secretariat had also provided a general outline on the Director-General's idea of ""Trade policy clinics"" and had indicated that an information note which elaborated the concept (scope, objectives and modalities) as well as on the possible beneficiaries would be circulated before the 45th Session. Those two documents were contained in JOB(03)/93 and JOB(03)94, both dated 16 May 2003.1","WTCOMTDM45.pdf","Chairman, CTD, Secretariat, MoUs, Secretariat, Committee, Secretariat, Director-General"
"4911",4911,"55","55.      The Secretariat said that it was pleased to introduce a comprehensive note on outsourcing contained in document JOB(03)/93. That note built on the Secretariat's report at the 44th session of the CTD and explained in more detail the approach of the Secretariat to increase outsourcing of TA activities to outside consultants and to other international organisations. The first part of the note dealt with individual consultants and provided details about the new WTO roster and the modalities for its use. Under the new approach, the system for outsourcing was made more predictable to ensure fairness and transparency. While following basic principles regarding overall WTO objectives in that area, he said that the Secretariat would retain flexibility to fulfil its mandate in conformity with the Guidelines for WTO Technical Cooperation adopted by the CTD.2 An official WTO roster of consultants was in preparation and would be managed by the Human Resources Section. It would consist of two separate lists: the ""General List"" and the ""Selected List"". The present roster would become part of the ""General List"", which would be expanded through spontaneous applications from candidates and through suggestions from WTO Divisions, Members, other intergovernmental organizations or partners. Delegations would be reminded of the possibility of recommending names for inclusion in the roster. Experts to be considered for inclusion in the roster would essentially be former trade policy diplomats/officials, former GATT/WTO staff members, academics, recognised experts in a specific field, trainers, and officials from other international organizations and recognised bodies. The ""Selected List"" of the roster would contain only the names of tested experts. It would be possible for any Division of the WTO to hire the consultants on that second list of the Roster directly for appropriate missions following a simplified procedure. On the basis of the Annual Plan for Training and Technical Cooperation and inputs from relevant divisions, the ITTC would evaluate the WTO Secretariat's needs in terms of outsourcing. While the Human Resources Section would manage the roster, the ITTC would coordinate the selection of consultants from the roster for each activity, in order to ensure effective delivery of TA and full implementation of the TA plan.","WTCOMTDM45.pdf","Secretariat, Secretariat, CTD, Secretariat, WTO, WTO, Secretariat, WTO, Technical, Cooperation, CTD, WTO, Human, Resources, Section, WTO, Members, GATT/WTO, WTO, ITTC, WTO, Secretariat, Human, Resources, Section, ITTC"
"4912",4912,"56","56.     The Secretariat continued by saying that the second part of its note on outsourcing contained a report on WTO cooperation with other international institutions and described the process undertaken by the Secretariat to come up with an effective and coherent approach to partnerships aimed at         1             Subsequently issued as documents WT/COMTD/W/116 and WT/COMTD/W/117 respectively.         2             WT/COMTD/8                                                                                      WT/COMTD/M/45                                                                                             Page 17 fostering outsourcing and joint activities in training and TA. The Secretariat’s current policy was clearly reiterated in the note. That policy underlined that inter-agency arrangements and strategic partnerships were essential in order to respond fully to the significant mandate on TA in the Doha Ministerial Declaration. Those arrangements were also necessary in areas outside the strict competence of the WTO. One example was the involvement of UNCTAD in trade and investment activities. Such partner institutions, at the global and regional levels, had been progressively identified over the years, and many activities had taken place in areas identified for intensified cooperation. The WTO Secretariat had endeavoured over the past 18 months to develop and formalize its cooperation with different partners at the international and regional level in order to respond adequately to the Doha Development Agenda mandates. That cooperation was generally embodied in MoUs signed with WTO’s partners. The Secretariat had also engaged in reformulating pre-existing MoUs to render them relevant to the Doha Development Agenda. The Secretariat was introducing some basic elements that embodied a clearer approach to the main administrative aspects of MoUs in order to allow a more coherent policy on partnerships with other organizations. That would allow the WTO to present its potential partners with a standard agreement as a basis for negotiations. As a result, the Secretariat would be able to deepen its consultations with partner institutions during the preparation of future annual plans for training and TA and make the best use of their comparative advantages in the areas of specialisation as well as in financial and other matters governed by the provisions of the MoUs in force. To that end and for coherence purposes, the Secretariat would also make full use of the WTO/OECD Doha Development Agenda Trade Capacity Building Database.","WTCOMTDM45.pdf","Secretariat, WTO, Secretariat, TA, Secretariat, WTO, UNCTAD, WTO, Secretariat, Doha, Development, Agenda, MoUs, WTO, Secretariat, Doha, Development, Agenda, Secretariat, MoUs, WTO, Secretariat, MoUs, Secretariat"
"4913",4913,"57","57.     The representative of the European Communities said that outsourcing was an important issue on which further reflection was needed to ensure that WTO's comparative advantage was maintained. Other agencies should be used to deliver TA where that made sense. He noted the focus on two potential sources of outsourcing: consultants and partner institutions. His delegation encouraged the Secretariat to consider using other potential sources such as national government entities, universities and other academic institutions, and management schools. His delegation wished to see something more than a descriptive picture of how consultants and partner institutions were used, what the procedures were, how the registry of consultants was established and how the MoUs with partner agencies were set up. His delegation requested a more long-term perspective stating the strategy and goals of outsourcing in the coming years. He said that he realized that the Secretariat might throw that question back to the Members with the argument that the Secretariat can not do that for the Members. He was not suggesting that the Secretariat decide the strategy and the goals for outsourcing without guidance from the Members, but the issue had to be debated. His delegation also had questions related to the types of activities suitable and the ones not suitable for outsourcing and if particular institutions and delivery agents were more appropriate than others in certain circumstances. That required further discussion in preparing the 2004 TA Plan and future plans. When using outsourcing there were questions of quality control. Members would look to the Secretariat to ensure quality. Other questions such as monitoring and evaluation were also relevant. It is possible that the Secretariat felt that it was difficult enough to evaluate the activities it carried out itself and that it might be even more difficult to evaluate and track activities undertaken by others. His delegation welcomed the ideas expressed in the note by the Secretariat even though they left some questions open.","WTCOMTDM45.pdf","European, Communities, WTO, Secretariat, MoUs, Secretariat, Members, Secretariat, Members, Secretariat, Members, Members, Secretariat, Secretariat, Secretariat"
"4914",4914,"58","58.     The representative of India said that Members had discussed the issue of outsourcing at the last meeting of the CTD. The note by the Secretariat provided a basis for further reflection on the concept of outsourcing of WTO's TA activities. Two suggestions had been made during the previous discussion of the issue. One was the importance of involving and using the expertise of regional academic institutions. That linkage had to be considered while developing any roster of experts as it could have positive spill-over effects. He understood that the former WTO Training Institute had been trying to develop such linkages with regional academic institutions. The second issue related to the development of the roster itself. Footnote 2 in the Secretariat note indicated that an initial roster WT/COMTD/M/45 Page 18 already existed based on names provided by Members. The aim seemed to be to broaden that roster. The idea discussed at the last meeting was to ensure a balance between developing and developed country experts. It would be useful for Members to keep that in mind in their further consideration of the issue. However, it was of primary importance that any expert engaged had the requisite expertise, as outlined in paragraph 7 of the Secretariat note. A third issue for Members to consider was the role the CTD should play in developing and monitoring the roster.","WTCOMTDM45.pdf","India, Members, CTD, Secretariat, WTO, WTO, Training, Institute, Secretariat, Members, Members, Secretariat, Members, CTD"
"4915",4915,"59","59.      The representative of Australia said that her delegation had a number of questions with respect to the Secretariat note but appreciated that that meeting might not be the time to canvass all of them. Her delegation, as other delegations, had a general interest in how the funding of outsourced activities was envisaged. She also requested more information on guidelines and criteria for the selection of suitable consultants, whether such guidelines were necessary and how they would be constructed. The Secretariat would have an important future role in evaluating the output of consultants and other institutions. It would therefore be useful to begin to discuss processes for evaluation at an early stage. When considering the cost of outsourcing, the rates suggested in the note should be compared to the cost of having Secretariat staff perform similar duties.","WTCOMTDM45.pdf","Australia, Secretariat, Secretariat, Secretariat"

"4917",4917,"60","60.      The representative of Japan said that the issue of outsourcing was important and his delegation appreciated the general direction of the Secretariat note. The limited financial and human resources of the Secretariat could be used more efficiently by strengthening the Secretariat's cooperation with outside experts and regional organizations with certain comparative advantages. Relating partly to the comments made by the delegations of the European Communities and India, he said that neutrality was a core issue when considering outsourcing. If a former Japanese Ambassador or official was recruited to train, he would be well aware of the position of the Government of Japan. He therefore asked for examples of areas where outsourcing would be efficient and effective taking the neutrality aspect into account. Second, with respect to MoUs, he said that paragraph 22(b) on page 5 of the Secretariat Note stated that ""So far, WTO has generally financed a significant portion of the budget of any TA activity organised jointly with other organisations (more than 50 per cent on average)."" However, when the Secretariat had been asked about its cost sharing with other organizations during the discussion of the 2003 TA Plan, it had responded that it applied the principle that each organization paid half of the cost for joint activities. He said that he realized that there were different types of cooperation where one organization might only be a co-organizer, taking responsibility for less than half of the activity. He asked the Secretariat to clarify the rules it followed in such situations. He said that the reason why he asked that question was that the Government of Japan had both contributed to the DDAGTF and funded other organizations' parts of their joint activities with the WTO. Other organizations had requested funding for half of the cost of activities delivered in collaboration with the WTO. He said that he therefore was surprised that the WTO sometimes had paid more than half of the cost.","WTCOMTDM45.pdf","Japan, Secretariat, Secretariat, Secretariat, India, Ambassador, Japan, MoUs, Secretariat, Note, WTO, Secretariat, Secretariat, Japan, WTO, WTO, WTO"
"4918",4918,"61","61.     The representative of the United States said that her delegation was among those who believed that the concept of outsourcing had to be considered in order for the WTO to achieve what it had to achieve in the regular TA plan. The needs would always be greater than the ability to deliver, particularly as the Secretariat's expertise was critical for the negotiations themselves. Her delegation shared many of the questions that had been raised by other delegations, and in particular the points mentioned by the representative of the European Communities on the types of projects best suited for outside experts, the types of organizational skills that it would be most helpful to match with different types of projects to ensure that the right individuals or organisations were engaged, and the point made that evaluation and selection criteria had to be established.","WTCOMTDM45.pdf","United, States, WTO, Secretariat"
"4919",4919,"62","62.     The representative of Mauritius said that it was positive that the WTO tool-box for TRTA and capacity building was becoming larger. The outsourcing exercise was a good step towards the democratisation of WTO's TA and capacity building. His delegation hoped that outsourcing would achieve the aim of bringing a balance to WTO's TA by using resources from outside the system.

"4920",4920,"63","63.      The Secretariat said that it appreciated the comments made by Members and that the Secretariat would remain guided by the CTD which continued to oversee WTO's TA and development work. In response to the issues raised by the representative of the European Communities the Secretariat said that academics and Government officials with relevant expertise would be considered when outsourcing. Members would be asked to complement the WTO roster. With respect to the issue of strategy, the Secretariat said that the CTD would remain the principal guide and strategy setting body for the Secretariat's TA work. The Secretariat was encouraged that the CTD intended to remain engaged in TA and committed to its guiding role. As far as the outsourcing project was concerned, the Secretariat said that it had outsourced for a long time. Outsourcing was thus nothing new, even if the Committee believed that it should be more organized to bring all issues related to outsourcing into perspective. The Secretariat had prepared the note to introduce some focus and strategic planning to outsourcing. Quality control was an issue that concerned Members and the Secretariat alike. It was linked to the issue of the resources available to the TA Audit. With respect to regional academic institutions the Secretariat said that it already was working with a number of such institutions. That cooperation had been intensified in Africa in the context of the three months training courses. The trainers at the ongoing three months training course in Nairobi came from different universities and institutions. They had just briefed about the deliberations in the CTD. Two of the participants in the three months training course in Nairobi had also been present at the launch of the training of trainers programme and had been consulted in the preparation of the Secretariat note. The Secretariat note was thus the result of consultations with individuals, institutions, delegations, governments, donors, regional institutions and academics.","WTCOMTDM45.pdf","Secretariat, Members, Secretariat, CTD, WTO, European, Communities, the, Secretariat, Members, WTO, Secretariat, CTD, Secretariat, Secretariat, TA, Secretariat, Committee, Secretariat, Members, Secretariat, Secretariat, Africa, Nairobi, CTD, Nairobi, Secretariat, Secretariat"
"4921",4921,"64","64.      The Secretariat continued by saying that it concurred with Members' wish for a regionally balanced choice of consultants and institutions to outsource to. It also agreed with the delegation of Japan that the issue of neutrality of consultants was important. The TA Audit had a role to play in that respect. It was also important to note that the Secretariat would only outsource some aspects of an activity, and not the activity as a whole. The Secretariat would continue to play the lead role in all WTO TA activities. Outside expertise would only supplement and support work done by the WTO Secretariat itself. The Secretariat would consequently be monitoring how consultants respected the requirements of objectivity and high standards. That monitoring could be further enhanced if the capacity of the WTO TA Audit was enhanced. With respect to the issue of funding raised by the representative of Australia the Secretariat said that outsourcing was not a new activity. Outsourcing was a continuing activity that needed to be re-evaluated, focussed and controlled as it had grown much in the recent past. The remuneration of consultants would continue at the same level as in the past. Outsourcing had to be considered from a cost-benefit perspective. The possibility of increasing the strength of the Secretariat should always be considered as opposed to outsourcing and vice versa. The representative of Japan had asked a question relating to MoUs and cost sharing and the Secretariat responded that it was moving towards a cost-sharing of fifty-fifty through more formalized agreements with other organizations elaborated in the MoUs. The Secretariat would have to look more closely at the particular case mentioned by the representative of Japan. It knew of situations where it had contributed 75 per cent of the cost while regional economic institutions had contributed 25 per cent of the cost of activities in which they played minor roles. However, it had to be kept in mind that regional economic institutions such as ESCAP and ECA also often contributed expertise to joint activities. The idea was to build tripartite relationships in terms of cost-sharing between such UN commissions, regional development banks and the WTO. The Secretariat concluded by saying that it would be pleased to provide further information if Members so requested.

"4923",4923,"66","66.      The Secretariat said that a note on ""trade policy clinics"" had been circulated to Members as JOB/(03)94. That note focused and expanded on three main aspects of the trade policy clinics: scope, beneficiaries, and modalities for the implementation of trade policy clinics. First, the Secretariat had refined the scope of the trade policy clinics. The trade policy clinics would be demand-driven and tailored to come up with practical recommendations on specific trade-policy concerns of the requesting Members in areas that would not be covered by the Secretariat's present TA activities. The trade policy clinics would also provide the Secretariat with a mechanism to respond quickly and flexibly to crises or urgent TA needs over the course of 2003. Features could include preliminary assessments of technical cooperation and capacity building needs and, where appropriate, be fed into the WTO regular training/TA process. Second, the Secretariat had initially identified three groups of beneficiaries that would have priority: countries emerging from crises or conflicts which needed to start from ""ground zero"" in developing their trade regime as their institutional capacity had been destroyed in conflicts for example; countries in transition which had an urgent need for market- oriented legislative and trade policy assistance; and small economies which faced specific problems. Moreover, the Secretariat would also take into account whether requesting Members benefited from other major TA programmes before making a final selection of beneficiaries. Third, like any other training/TA activity, the trade policy clinics would be coordinated, administered and delivered by the ITTC. Due to their related experience, the Trade Policies Review Division and the Development Division would be closely associated. Furthermore, the ITTC would seek to involve and build synergies with other international organisations whose particular expertise would be relevant to the needs of the beneficiary. Finally, the Secretariat hoped to organise, in the near future, a pilot trade policy clinic in order to test its ideas and gain operational experience. That would enable the Secretariat to elaborate further on that TA product and revert to Members for more guidance. The Secretariat said that Members' inputs would contribute to refining the concept and ensure that it effectively met Members' needs.","WTCOMTDM45.pdf","Secretariat, Members, Secretariat, Members, Secretariat, Secretariat, WTO, Secretariat, Secretariat, Members, ITTC, Development, Division, ITTC, Secretariat, Secretariat, Members, Secretariat, Members, Members"
"4924",4924,"67","67.      The representative of Mauritius said that his delegation had noted with interest the functional details of the trade policy clinics initiative. His delegation appreciated that priority was going to be given to countries emerging from crisis or conflict situations. He was also happy to note that it would encompass the interests of transition economies and small economies as that was of particular interest to his delegation. The trade policy clinics were welcome as there was a need to carry out a diagnosis of the problems and issues related to small economies, as provided for in the Doha Development Agenda. Paragraph 35 of the Doha Ministerial Declaration contained the specific mandate which required the framing of responses to the problems and needs of the small economies. The trade policy clinics was an important instrument in the developmental tool-box of the WTO. It would be a good complement to already existing tools. It was his understanding that once a trade policy clinic had been undertaken on a pilot basis, an evaluation of its efficiency would be undertaken. He believed that it was good to assess the trade policy clinics as early as possible and determine possible lessons that could improve future delivery. If the experience with the first trade policy clinic would not be conclusive, he hoped that remedies would be sought to make them more meaningful in the future. The aim of the trade policy clinics was to ensure that Members were empowered to strike the right balance between their rights and obligations. It was therefore important to recognize that the trade policy clinics had to be designed to feed into the regular WTO TA and capacity building programmes. He said that if the trade policy clinics were to be successful, they would have to be backed by earmarked funds. It was unhelpful to have a TA programme, the implementation of which was uncertain. No TA activity was implemented without the back-up of financial resources.","WTCOMTDM45.pdf","Mauritius, Doha, Development, Agenda, WTO, Members, WTO"
"4925",4925,"68","68.     He went on to speak about the regional dimension of the trade policy clinics and said that there was a need to determine, in advance, the full range of issues of common interest to the Members of the region. That was an important element of the approach that the Secretariat was taking. His delegation agreed that there was a need to avoid duplication. Each Member should take that as a warning to ensure that there was no duplication. There was no doubt that the trade policy clinics would be needs-based and would succeed. The Secretariat had the infrastructure and the human                                                                                     WT/COMTD/M/45                                                                                            Page 21 resources necessary to carry them out. However, their success was contingent on the necessary funds being made available. His delegation was aware of the efforts made by donor partners and reiterated his delegation's gratitude for their continued support. The trade policy clinics was a new and commendable initiative to which he was certain that the donor partners would respond adequately.","WTCOMTDM45.pdf","Members, Secretariat, Member, Secretariat"
"4926",4926,"69","69.      The representative of Rwanda said that his delegation wished to see the trade policy clinics integrated into WTO's regular TA. The criteria identified for the holding of trade policy clinics were legitimate as the trade policy clinics would target WTO Members emerging from crises, transition economies and small economies. Many Members wished to make efforts to integrate into the multilateral trading system. However, the situation in countries emerging from conflicts such as Rwanda would merit real capacity building at all levels. The Government of Rwanda was currently engaged in a real liberalization effort and deserved to be assisted. Trade was one of the most important means to rid countries of poverty and he was confident that the UN goals to reduce poverty would by met before 2015. His Government was committed to reducing poverty to 25 per cent of Rwanda's population by 2015.

"4928",4928,"70","70.      The representative of Switzerland said that the trade policy clinics were an attractive tool. The trade policy clinics were indicative of the need of some countries to have a better dialogue with the WTO and receive practical support in the application of their trade policies. The trade policy clinics were in that sense closely related to regular TA. However, he said that it might be difficult to restrict that type of service to emergencies or to a category of countries that could not be easily defined. His delegation therefore wished to gain more experience from the implementation of trade policy clinics. A decision might then be taken to offer them to a wider group of beneficiaries. Trade policy clinics should be seen as a transitional solution that went in the direction of something that had been discussed in the context of special and differential treatment (S&D) which was to create a possibility of monitoring, defined in that context in respect to differential treatment for developing countries and LDCs in particular. His delegation believed that what was needed over time was a working relationship between the Members and the Secretariat in specific countries to assist those Members to use the opportunities of S&D and build institutions to enhance their ability to comply with trade rules. That should, in the longer term, be seen as an extension of the Trade Policy Reviews which, at the present time, were the only instrument of direct contact with Members at the working level. The trade policy clinics should be considered as a transitional scheme and a pilot experience in view of a future extension of the services of the Secretariat but also of the Members in the sense that such an activity would imply a peer review of national action plans by WTO bodies. Members would also have to take the costs of any extension of the trade policy clinics into account.","WTCOMTDM45.pdf","Switzerland, WTO, LDCs, Members, Secretariat, Members, Members, Secretariat, Members, WTO, Members"

The representative of Mauritania said that paragraph 3 of document JOB(03)94 had drawn his delegation's attention as it stated that ""...a country which already benefits from the Integrated Framework (IF) or JITAP should not be able to request a clinic."" It was logical to give priority to a certain group of countries as mentioned in the document. However, it was also logical that all useful WTO services should be extended to a larger number of beneficiaries. The possibility should remain open for other Members to benefit from the trade policy clinics in the future, keeping in mind the capacity of the trade policy clinics, the nature of the requests and the resources available.","WTCOMTDM45.pdf","Mauritania, WTO, Members"
"4930",4930,"72","72.     The representative of Tunisia said that his delegation agreed with the need to avoid any overlap in the provision of WTO TA. Nevertheless, the idea of trade policy clinics was an interesting one and the trade policy clinics were only in the process of being conceived. The trade policy clinics should constitute a pilot scheme to make developing countries aware of their rights in the WTO Agreements. His delegation therefore supported the statement made by the representative of Mauritania with respect to paragraph 3 of JOB(03)94. The trade policy clinics should not be limited to a few Members. It should rather be enlarged to all Members that needed it. WT/COMTD/M/45 Page 22","WTCOMTDM45.pdf","Tunisia, WTO, WTO, Mauritania, Members, Members"
"4931",4931,"73","73.      The representative of the United States said that, since the Director-General had introduced the idea of trade policy clinics, her delegation had been intrigued by how it might be conceived. Document JOB(03)94 was helpful in that respect. It was appropriate to consider the trade policy clinics as an initial concept that would focus on crisis-type situations or unique problems. The large regular programme of TA should meet the other needs. However, the trade policy clinics might find their niche for those Members in particular need. Beginning with that focus seemed logical. Over time it could then be considered if there was a way to expand the trade policy clinics once they had been tested and proven to work. She noted that the note by the Secretariat did not mention how the trade policy clinics would be financed. She asked how their funding related to the 2003 TA Plan and the DDAGTF and whether the trade policy clinics would be part of the DDAGTF or separate. Her delegation agreed with the delegation of Mauritius that it was important to expand the tools available to meet the different needs of WTO Members.","WTCOMTDM45.pdf","United, States, Director-General, Members, Secretariat, Mauritius, WTO, Members"
"4932",4932,"74","74.      The representative of the European Communities said that his delegation was not entirely clear about what the trade policy clinics could provide. The Secretariat note did not make that much clearer as it suggested that the trade policy clinics could be useful in a number of situations and in different contexts such as dealing with crisis situations, filling gaps in the TA plans, assisting Members implement obligations and translating them into domestic legislation, enhancing capacity, playing a diagnostic role in determining needs, and supporting the requests of Members in need of TA. That indicated that there still were a number of tracks open and it was unclear which one of those would be favoured. His delegation was interested in the idea of having the trade policy clinics provide a standing framework which would enable the Secretariat to respond to needs that emerge at short notice during the course of a year and which could therefore not be planned. That was linked to the question of how to assess requests for ad hoc activities and how to decide which ones to respond to at what time. It was necessary to work with clear criteria given the existing human and other resource constraints. He said that a simple first come, first served response might not be adequate. If two or three crisis followed one after the other the Secretariat would soon be overwhelmed with demands that could not be met if it worked on that basis. He said that his delegation would welcome any opportunity to further discuss the trade policy clinics after the pilot clinic had been carried out. He asked what this would involve and when it would be undertaken. His delegation wished to ensure complementarily between the trade policy clinics and other activities, including those undertaken by other agencies or organisations. One example was countries which had recently emerged from crisis or conflict situations in which there often were a number of organizations working on the ground with the aim of assisting them to recover. The World Bank was often involved in such situations and if the WTO was to be involved as well it had to be clear that the WTO had a complementary role to play. Similarly, there was already the IF for the LDCs which included a process based on national plans and strategies. Again, anything done by the WTO in that context had to support the already existing exercises.","WTCOMTDM45.pdf","European, Communities, Secretariat, Members, Members, Secretariat, Secretariat, World, Bank, WTO, WTO, LDCs, WTO"
"4933",4933,"75","75.      The Secretariat thanked delegations for their feedback on the note and for providing the Secretariat with further guidance on the trade policy clinics. No trade policy clinic had yet been held. However, the Government of Sierra Leone had requested a trade policy clinic. Sierra Leone was an example of a country emerging from civil war and the Secretariat was considering it as a possible candidate for a pilot trade policy clinic. The trade policy clinics would not be launched on a wide basis. They would respond to specific needs and be carried out in Member countries that met the set criteria. Based on the experience gained, the Secretariat would consult with Members and other agencies with which the WTO normally cooperated to get information regarding the security situations and other activities undertaken in each possible candidate country for a trade policy clinic. With respect to funding he said that the intention was to include the trade policy clinics in the 2004 TA Plan. Responses to a number of the questions posed by Members would find their answers once the draft 2004 TA Plan would be considered. The Secretariat had already began to consult with different groups of Members in preparation of the 2004 TA Plan. Members' ideas and the ideas of trade policy clinics and outsourcing would be reflected in that Plan. The Director-General had                                                                                      WT/COMTD/M/45                                                                                             Page 23 envisioned the trade policy clinics when he had heard of the 2003 TA Plan. He had since been involved in the elaboration of the trade policy clinics. The Secretariat would remain engaged and guided by Members in the further elaboration of trade policy clinics. The trade policy clinics would be funded as a TA project in 2003, using the DDAGTF. The Secretariat had a certain leverage as some money could be spent on ad hoc and other activities such as the trade policy clinics. However, the trade policy clinics would get a specific place in the 2004 TA Plan. He said that he would provide Members with additional information as the trade policy clinics evolved.","WTCOMTDM45.pdf","Secretariat, Secretariat, Sierra, Leone, Sierra, Leone, Secretariat, Member, Secretariat, Members, WTO, Members, Secretariat, Members, Members, Director-General, Secretariat, Members, Secretariat, Members"

As Members were aware, the Training Institute which had been created in June 2001 had been merged with the Technical Cooperation Division to create the ITTC directed by Mr. Paul Rolian. The report on the training activities which Members had in front of them was thus the last one which would present the training activities of the former Training Institute in a separate manner from other WTO TA activities. The information regarding training activities would in the future be part of the quarterly reports on the training and technical cooperation activities. The report contained in document WT/COMTD/W/115 covered the period from 1 September 2002, which was the date of the last report, to 15 March 2003, which was the date of the reorganization of WTO's training and technical cooperation activities.","WTCOMTDM45.pdf","Chairman, Members, Training, Institute, Technical, Cooperation, Division, ITTC, Paul, Rolian, Members, Training, Institute, WTO, WTO"

The representative of the United States said that her delegation had noted that the Secretariat had spent a fair amount of its resources in the past year to train the trainers within the WTO Secretariat. Her delegation considered that to be an important initiative in view of the fact that WTO staff was often used for training purposes. However, she asked what the Secretariat's intention was in the coming year and whether the Secretariat intended to expand the training of trainers concept beyond the Secretariat. She noted that the Secretariat in previous discussions had mentioned that part of the purpose of the regional training programmes was the training of trainers, but wondered whether other such initiatives to take the training of trainers concept out of the Secretariat were considered.","WTCOMTDM45.pdf","United, States, Secretariat, WTO, Secretariat, WTO, Secretariat, Secretariat, Secretariat, Secretariat, Secretariat"

The Chairman recalled that, at previous sessions of the CTD, Members had agreed to invite the following intergovernmental organizations on an ad hoc, meeting-by-meeting basis: the Arab Maghreb Union (AMU); the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS); the Economic Cooperation Organisation (ECO); the Inter-Arab Investment Guarantee Corporation; the Islamic Development Bank (IDB); the Organisation of African Unity (OAU); the Organisation of the Islamic Conference (OIC); the South Centre; the South Pacific Forum; the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP); the West African Economic and Monetary Union (WAEMU); and the World Intellectual Property Organisation (WIPO).

"4939",4939,"80","80.      The Secretariat said that it did have plans to take the training of trainers concept beyond the Secretariat staff. However, that would not be the same kind of training. It had to be kept in mind that the internal training of trainers had essentially dealt with presentation skills and how to conduct a training activity, as most of the staff recruited by the Secretariat were not recruited for their didactic skills but were hired as they were experts in particular trade topics. However, that staff had increasingly been called upon to carry out training activities. The training of trainers activities that would be conducted outside the Secretariat would be different in the sense that they would involve capacity building for training in regional institutions. The focus would not be on the training skills as the academics the Secretariat was working with were assumed to have the capacity to teach. The aim of that training would rather be to assist with the development of curricula, expertise in WTO related matters which might not be their specialization, and generally move the focus to longer term capacity building of that nature. The two concepts of training of trainers were different, and the Secretariat was not transposing the training carried out in the Secretariat to the field.","WTCOMTDM45.pdf","Secretariat, Secretariat, Secretariat, Secretariat, Secretariat, WTO, Secretariat, Secretariat"

The delegations of Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda had submitted a paper on the issue contained in document WT/COMTD/W/113.","WTCOMTDM45.pdf","Chairman, Kenya, Tanzania, Uganda"
"4942",4942,"83","83.      The representative of Kenya said that she wished to introduce the non-paper contained in document WT/COMTD/W/113. She said that Members would recall that, at the last meeting of the Committee, held on 7 March 2003, her delegation had made a statement on behalf of the delegations of Kenya, Uganda, Tanzania, Lesotho and Zimbabwe expressing concern at the crisis situation created by declining prices of primary commodities and highlighting the need to address in the WTO discussions and negotiations the problems which that situation posed to the trade and development of the primary exporting countries. Her delegation had chosen to make a somewhat lengthy and detailed statement at that time as the non-paper, on which her delegation was working in cooperation with delegations from other Commonwealth developing countries and which contained some preliminary ideas on the action that could be taken under the WTO’s rule based system to deal with those problems, had not been ready by the time of that meeting. She said that she was glad that the non- paper had been circulated and that it now could provide a basis for discussions in the CTD. She said that she would therefore confine herself to emphasizing the main points that had been made in the non-paper. They included the following. First, that the prices of almost all primary commodities (both agricultural and minerals) had fallen to exceptionally low levels as compared to the levels that had prevailed in the twenty-year period from 1980 to 2000. Secondly, the main factor responsible for the decline in the prices of agricultural commodities was the imbalance between supply and demand. In the case of coffee and cocoa and some other commodities, the oversupply was structural in nature as the production consistently exceeded world demand. For commodities such as cotton, sugar and vegetable oils, which were produced both in the developed and developing countries, the primary reason for the prevailing low prices was the domestic and export subsidies (including export finance and credits) granted by some developed countries. In the case of sugar however, a domestic support policy managed by the European Union provided the benefit of higher guaranteed domestic prices to sugar imported from some developing countries. Third, the sharp decline in the prices of primary commodities had created a crisis situation in most commodity exporting countries as there was a close relationship between world market prices and poverty levels. The decline in prices of commodities had also resulted in a steep fall in foreign exchange earnings for about fifty developing countries which depended on three or fewer commodities for more than half of their exports. Thirty-seven of those countries had been categorized by the IMF and the World Bank as Heavily Indebted Poor Countries. Fourth, although the prices of some of the commodities had risen since the mid 2002, those increases appeared to be prompted either by poor harvests or by speculative buying due to political developments rather than reflecting any long term trend towards an improved balance between world demand and supply.","WTCOMTDM45.pdf","Kenya, Members, Committee, Kenya, Uganda, Tanzania, Lesotho, Zimbabwe, WTO, Commonwealth, WTO, CTD, European, Union, IMF, World, Bank"
"4943",4943,"84","84.     She further said that her delegation was aware that efforts were being made by international commodity organizations and some non-governmental organizations as well as by the producing countries themselves to find solutions to the problems posed by declining prices of primary commodities. Those included a proposal adopted by the International Coffee Organization that member countries should voluntarily agree to prohibit the export of coffee which did not meet certain minimum standards. She said that her delegation was aware that the cotton exporting countries from Africa had demanded that the WTO agree on a total ban on the granting of subsidies to cotton producers. Some of the producing countries appeared to be consulting among themselves on the                                                                                    WT/COMTD/M/45                                                                                           Page 25 desirability and feasibility of entering into arrangements for supply management for example for commodities like coffee and sugar. Even though those were steps in the right direction, the countries sponsoring the non-paper considered that those efforts needed to be complemented by focused and coordinated work in the WTO to seek long term solutions to the problems faced by primary exporting countries under its rule based system. The legal basis for such work in the WTO was provided by Article XXXVIII in Part IV of the GATT which inter alia stated that Member countries might take ""Joint action"" to negotiate, if necessary, international arrangements providing for ""measures designed to stabilize and improve conditions of world markets in these products, including measures designed to attain stable, equitable and remunerative prices for exports of primary products"". Taking those provisions of the GATT into account and the serious adverse impact which declining prices of primary commodities were having on the trade and economic development of exporting countries and on their efforts to alleviate poverty, the authors of the non-paper suggested that the CTD examine, on a priority basis, the impact which the crisis situation created by those developments was having on: the trade and development of countries which were heavily dependent on exports of primary commodities and on their capacity to pay and service their foreign debts. The non-paper identified an illustrative list of elements that could be included in the work programme that might be adopted as a result of such an examination.","WTCOMTDM45.pdf","International, Coffee, Organization, Africa, WTO, WTO, WTO, GATT, Member, GATT, CTD"
"4944",4944,"85","85.      She continued by saying that, with that description of the main points and of the proposals for action made in the non-paper, she would, before turning to the discussions on how future work in the Committee on that agenda item should be organized, make a few general observations. She said that she had earlier referred to the provisions of Part IV of GATT which applied primarily to developing countries. It was however worth noting that two agreements which were not based on those provisions, but aimed at supply management through taking measures for avoiding surpluses and shortages, had been negotiated during the Tokyo Round. Those were the Agreement on Bovine Meat and the Agreement on Diary Products. The latter Agreement also provided for a mechanism for the maintenance of prices at agreed levels. More recently there appeared to be considerable support among developed countries for the proposal to bring to the WTO for incorporation in its legal framework, the agreement which was under negotiations in OECD for reducing the structural oversupply of steel in world markets, through inter alia the acceptance by producing countries of greater discipline in the use of subsidies in that sector. The two Agreements on Bovine Meat and the Agreement on Diary Products had been terminated by the participating countries a few years back. The purpose of referring to those aspects of past developments in the GATT and to possible similar developments in the future work in the WTO, was to emphasis that the legal framework created by the WTO provided sufficient flexibility to take action for the stabilization of prices, taking into account special situations in the production and trade of specific commodities, provided that there were sufficient political will on the part of all Member countries to take such action.","WTCOMTDM45.pdf","Committee, GATT, Tokyo, WTO, OECD, GATT, WTO, WTO, Member"
"4945",4945,"86","86.      She turned to the question of how further work in the area should be organized and said that her delegation believed that it was necessary to bear in mind that that meeting of the Committee would be the last one before the Cancún Ministerial Conference. The Members sponsoring the non- paper therefore realized that it would not be possible for the CTD, at that meeting, to have in depth and substantive discussion on the issues raised in the non paper. She therefore suggested that the CTD could arrange a special session to consider the issue outlined in the non-paper. The issue of commodities was an important issue which was directly linked to development. She further suggested that the Chairman, after three to four weeks should arrange for informal consultations to consider the substantive issues raised in the non-paper such as how the need to take urgent action to deal with the crisis situation created by the declining prices of primary commodities could be addressed in the communiqué or any other document that might be prepared to reflect the results of the Cancún Ministerial Conference and how the future work in the CTD on the subject-matter should be organized in the period post the Cancún Ministerial Conference.

"4946",4946,"87","87.      The representative of Cuba said that he thanked the delegations of Kenya, Uganda and Tanzania for their communication on the important issue of primary commodities. It had been recognized that primary commodities were of primordial importance for developing countries. Agricultural products had been characterised by depressed prices for many important export products such as sugar and coffee. No possible solution seemed to emerge as structural imbalances affected those markets. He said that a recent report pointed out that the average prices for almost all commodities had been constantly declining from a maximum reached in the 1980s to the minimum prices of the last two decades. The decline in prices had been even more spectacular for tropical products. The prices for coffee had gone down to the lowest level in the past 30 years. Other agricultural products such as beverages had faced similar situations. Primary products had undergone a significant deterioration. For example, cotton prices had dropped to its lowest level when compared to the mid-1980s. There were 43 countries in Sub-Sahara, in Latin America and in the Caribbean who obtained more that 50 per cent of their agricultural export earnings from one single agricultural commodity. In those countries, there was a direct relationship between the trade of commodities, economic growth and food security. In spite of the priority given in the Doha Ministerial Declaration to the establishment of a legal framework for the progress of developing countries, the agricultural negotiations did not seem to have resolved the main problems of Members largely dependent on agricultural exports. He said that the large problems for developing countries which were related to the production of and trade in those products had not received any answers during those negotiations. High tariffs and tariff escalation made matters worse as they not only limited the problems to market access but also prevented the diversification of developing countries' agricultural production. In that connection, he said that his delegation believed that the document merited special attention in the framework of the ongoing negotiations.","WTCOMTDM45.pdf","Cuba, Kenya, Uganda, Tanzania, Sub-Sahara, Latin, America, Caribbean, Members"

"4951",4951,"91","91.      The representative of Switzerland said that his delegation had not had sufficient time to consult on what to do with the paper submitted by the delegation of Kenya and others. It was clear that falling commodity prices was a fundamental problem for many developing countries. The question was to what extent it was useful to discuss that in addition to the aspects which were already being discussed in the WTO, or whether those additional aspects should be discussed in other institutions. What was being discussed intensely at the WTO was the question of agriculture subsidies, the question of tariff escalation, which was another item in the agricultural negotiations, the future of the Generalized System of Preferences (GSP), and the different initiatives for the LDCs. The difficult question was whether other initiatives which might be necessary, such as those mentioned in the illustrative list of elements given by the proponents, required a new forum and whether the intention was to bring questions such as agreements between produces and other                                                                                    WT/COMTD/M/45                                                                                           Page 27 questions of that type into the WTO. On that issue, he could not give a reply for his Government. It was a question of international governance and his delegation would therefore agree to informal consultations. He said that he did not wish to give the impression that his delegation did not consider the problem of basic commodities as being important. It was one of the key questions for many poor countries at the present time. His Government was concerned about the different policies which had to be put into place to counter falling commodity prices. He was also concerned about where those questions should be discussed and where the decisions should be made.","WTCOMTDM45.pdf","Switzerland, Kenya, WTO, WTO, WTO"

Like other delegations, her delegation was also aware that ongoing negotiations in the WTO, particularly the market access and agriculture negotiations, were going to be important parts of the solution. That was where a lot of the focus should be.

His government was still considering the paper but had some initial concerns which he would not spell out in detail, other than to say that he thought that experiments with institutional arrangements to manage international markets had been tried previously without much success. His delegation was willing to discuss the issue further but remained to be convinced that following that track was the best way to resolve the problems. He said that he joined others who had pointed to the core business of the WTO, as reflected in the agriculture negotiations. Those discussions, which were aimed at improving market access and reducing the excessive domestic support levels that all Members currently faced were key and constituted the equal buy which could contribute to a stabilization and increase in international commodity prices. The focus should therefore be maintained on those issues in the lead up to the Cancún Ministerial Conference. If it was the desire of the Membership to continue discussing the issue, then his delegation looked forward to participate in such a discussion.","WTCOMTDM45.pdf","Australia, Kenya, WTO, Members"

She said that the report would be helpful when considering the financial elements of the delivery of the 2003 TA Plan and in terms of what the Secretariat was attempting to deliver for 2004 with the same resources. That gave Members a better sense to where they stood with respect to the overall 2003 TA Plan and its implementation. Members had received an assessment for the first half of the year and she asked when they would receive the report on the third quarter. She asked what the Secretariat's plans were with respect to ensuring that it delivered the remainder of activities that were feasible. She was talking in terms of an assessment of how those activities that had not been delivered as part of the 2002 TA Plan could be delivered or perhaps in finding an alternative way than had been anticipated to meet those needs. There had been a lot of reprogramming due to the SARS crisis and the Iraqi war. She said that it would be helpful for information on further implementation in 2003to be provided orally or where figures were involved it would be useful for delegations to receive that information in writing.","WTCOMTDM46.pdf","United, States, Switzerland, Secretariat, Members, Members, Secretariat"

He said that, following the consideration, the Chairman of the Sub-Committee, Ambassador Molander, had sent a letter which stated that, during its 33rd Session, the Sub-Committee on LDCs had welcomed the initiative taken by the Government of Canada. That letter was available in the room. The Sub-Committee had also appreciated the improvement in the rules-of-origin regulations for textiles and apparel products. The Chairman of the Sub-Committee had indicated that, for further information, the discussion in its entirety was available in the report of the 33rd Session of the Sub-Committee contained in document WT/COMTD/LDC/M/33.","WTCOMTDM46.pdf","Chairman, Members, CTD, LDCs, Canada, LDCs, Chairman, Ambassador, Molander, Canada, Chairman, Sub-Committee"

The Chairman said that said that the item relating to declining terms of trade for primary commodities, and its implication to the trade and development of primary commodity exporting countries had been discussed at the last meeting upon the request by some African primary commodity exporting countries. The delegations of Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda had submitted a paper on the issue contained in document WT/COMTD/W/113. The delegation of Kenya had, when introducing the document, highlighted the declining terms of trade for primary commodities and its effects on the trade and development of primary commodity exporting countries and had suggested that the WTO take action. The Committee had taken note of the document and the statements made and as requested by the Committee the Chairman said that he had held informal consultations on 3 July 2003 after which the delegations of Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda had suggested that the issue of declining terms of trade for primary commodities be included in the Cancún Ministerial Declaration or any document issued from that Conference. They had, in that context, submitted document WT/GC/W/508 of 22 July 2003 to the General Council. During the informal consultations of the CTD, Members had agreed that the Committee revert to the issue at its 46th Regular Session.","WTCOMTDM46.pdf","Chairman, Kenya, Tanzania, Uganda, Kenya, WTO, Committee, Committee, the, Chairman, Kenya, Tanzania, Uganda, Cancún, General, Council, CTD, Members, Committee"
"4976",4976,"102","102.    The representative of Kenya said that she wished to begin by thanking the Chairman, on behalf of her delegation and the delegations of Tanzania and Uganda, for the efforts he had made in pursuance of the request made by them to get a paragraph on commodity issues included in the Cancún Ministerial text. Her delegation considered that the failure of the Cancún Ministerial Conference should not in any way lead to the postponement of the analytical and research-oriented work which the Committee should undertake to ensure that in the current negotiations, solutions were found to the problems that the commodity exporting countries encountered as a result of declining commodity prices. Towards that end, she said that she wished to make the following suggestions for consideration and appropriate decisions at that or future meetings. First, the sponsors of the paper wished to propose that the Committee commence an examination of the problems that primary exporting countries encountered, on the basis of the elements that had been identified in the non- paper. She further proposed that the Secretariat be asked to prepare the background documentation                                                                                    WT/COMTD/M/46                                                                                           Page 33 for that exercise including an inventory of documents and reports that could provide a useful basis for discussion. That would help Members avoid duplicating what had already been done by other organizations. In that context, it was important to note that useful work for addressing those problems was being done not only by the concerned international commodity organizations but also by other organizations like UNCTAD and the World Bank. UNCTAD for instance, had recently arranged for a meeting of eminent experts to examine the problems faced by coffee exporting countries. The World Bank had issued a study entitled ""The State of Sustainable Coffee: A Study of Twelve Major Markets"" which surveyed the demand and consumption trends in eleven European markets and Japan. In addition, it appeared from the recent annual report of the WTO, that the Economic Research and Statistics Division of the Secretariat was engaged, as a part of its ongoing work, in examining some of the issues that had implications for the development of trade in primary commodities. To begin such discussions the CTD could hold a special session during which substantive discussions could be held on the issues identified in the non-paper. However, in order for substantive discussions to take place it would be necessary to ensure that the required background documentation was available to delegations well in advance of the proposed special session of the Committee. She proposed that the representatives of the World Bank, IMF and UNCTAD, and if possible the representatives of international commodity organizations, be invited to that special session.","WTCOMTDM46.pdf","Kenya, Chairman, Tanzania, Uganda, Cancún, Committee, Committee, Secretariat, Members, UNCTAD, World, Bank, UNCTAD, World, Bank, Japan, WTO, Economic, Research, and, Statistics, Division, Secretariat, CTD, Committee, World, Bank, IMF, UNCTAD"
"4977",4977,"103","103.     She went on to suggest that the Committee decide to transmit the non-paper, which her and other delegations had submitted, for consideration by the following bodies: the Special Session of the Committee on Agriculture when it resumed its work, the Negotiating Group on Market Access when it resumed its work, the Working Group on Trade, Debt and Finance and the Working Group on Trade, Transfer and Technology. Those bodies should be requested to commence an examination of the issues and problems identified in the non-paper, which fell within their respective mandates. She further suggested that the CTD should remain responsible for overseeing that progress was made by those bodies in finalizing concrete solutions during the course of the negotiations to the problems which the primary exporting countries faced as a result of declining commodity prices. The Committee should, towards that end request the other bodies to send continuous reports on their respective discussions for review and assessment.","WTCOMTDM46.pdf","Committee, Committee, on, Agriculture, Negotiating, Group, on, Market, Access, Working, Group, on, Trade, Working, Group, on, Trade, CTD, Committee"

The representative of Cuba said that at the last session when the initial proposal had been made by the delegations of Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda, her delegation had not been prepared to make any comment with respect to whether what was proposed could be implemented in the CTD. However, her Government had considered the issue and felt that it merited attention and her delegation therefore supported the proposals made in the third part of the document regarding the need to broaden the WTO's attention to primary commodities. That issue should be dealt with in the CTD.","WTCOMTDM46.pdf","Cuba, Kenya, Tanzania, Uganda, CTD, WTO, CTD"
"4979",4979,"105","105.     The representative of the United States said that her Government had had an opportunity to carefully review the paper submitted by the delegations of Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda and had strong reservations regarding the direction of the paper. The paper anticipated stabilizing commodity prices through supply management and other actions such as reducing production for example by cutting trees, buying buffer stocks or destroying them, forming international commodity agreements, and banning exports based on quality criteria. Her Government thought that that was going in the wrong direction. As her delegation had stated at the July 2003 meeting of the General Council, it was her delegation's view that prices and the terms of trade for commodities were functions of markets. The WTO was devoted to the ideas of competition and free trade. Her delegation therefore did not see the merit in contemplating arrangements that might restrict competition. Where such arrangements had been tried in the past, they had not been successful. As such agreements had become unworkable, Members had moved on in other directions. The goals of the WTO were to work towards trade liberalization, not trade restriction. Commodity arrangements to restrict production and manage markets were contrary to the goals of the WTO. Her delegation had also noted that the paper focused on a narrow set of commodities. Other Members could rightly argue that the prices of a broad range of agricultural and non-agricultural commodities had, at some point, WT/COMTD/M/46 Page 34 experienced volatility and decline. She asked whether it would be prudent to consider supply- management for any or all commodities or products that had experienced substantial price volatility at one point in time. Commodity prices that were low for a period would often reverse. She noted for instance that cotton prices were at a record high in 2003. Her delegation did not wish to contemplate price stabilization schemes, particularly considering previous efforts at plurilateral agreements such as those in dairy and meat. Her delegation was thus, at that point, unable to agree to the specific proposals that had been put forward by the delegation of Kenya on how to proceed, although her delegation understood and the concerns expressed. Also, there was no ongoing process in the negotiating groups on which to build at that point. It was therefore inappropriate to forward any work to the negotiating groups whose work had been suspended. More fundamentally, her delegation was not convinced that that was a particularly productive way of proceeding.","WTCOMTDM46.pdf","United, States, Kenya, Tanzania, Uganda, General, Council, WTO, Members, WTO, WTO, Members, Kenya"
"4980",4980,"106","106.    The representative of Canada said that her delegation had similar reservations as those expressed by the representative of the United States about the particular approaches proposed in the paper presented by the delegations of Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda. Notwithstanding that, her delegation did believe that it did contain some issues which were worth consideration in the CTD. Her delegation supported the idea of an inventory of documents. That was an important first step as a large number of documents existed on the topic. The Committee should however not decide immediately to hold a special session until it had considered the issue further as well as what was being done elsewhere. A session would be organized at UNCTAD the following day to consider the ""Report of the Meeting of Eminent Persons on Commodity Issues"".2 A large session was planned between UNCTAD and the International Institute for Sustainable Development (IISD) for later in 2003. With respect to the transfer of documents to other WTO bodies she said that her delegation considered it pointless to refer documents to bodies which were not operating at that time.","WTCOMTDM46.pdf","Canada, United, States, Kenya, Tanzania, Uganda, CTD, Committee, UNCTAD, UNCTAD, International, Institute, for, Sustainable, Development, WTO"
"4981",4981,"107","107.     The representative of Australia said that her delegation was sympathetic to the message behind the paper submitted by the delegations of Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda on the serious problems that low commodity prices were causing and the implications for development. It was for that reason that her Government continued to be a strong proponent of further international trade reform through the agricultural negotiations of the DDA. There was little doubt that a fairer and market-oriented agricultural trading system would provide significant benefits to all Members, and to developing countries in particular. She noted that the paper mentioned many issues that should be discussed in the agricultural negotiations. Her delegation was therefore prepared to consider the paper in further detail. However, her delegation also shared some of the concerns that had been voiced by the delegation of Canada such as where in the WTO the issue should best be raised and that Members needed to be mindful of what the WTO could and could not do. The suggestion made by the representative of Kenya for an inventory of documents was an important first step that should be considered as a way forward.","WTCOMTDM46.pdf","Australia, Kenya, Tanzania, Uganda, DDA, Members, Canada, WTO, Members, WTO, Kenya"
"4982",4982,"108","108.     The representative of the European Communities said that his delegation was not in a position to agree to the proposals that had been made by the representative of Kenya. Nevertheless, his delegation nevertheless recognized that there were issues in connection with trade and commodities that might merit further discussion and analysis within the framework of the CTD. His delegation had no objection to pursuing such work in the coming months. However, the CTD had to be clear about the scope and objectives of any discussions it envisaged, as well as how discussions in the WTO, and in the CTD specifically, could provide added value to efforts made by other international organizations, some of which had already been mentioned such as UNCTAD, the World Bank and the IMF. For that reason, the CTD needed to reflect on how to proceed. In doing so, the Committee needed to address questions relating to the focus of the discussions. His delegation joined other delegations in expressing reservations against reintroducing market management instruments which had been attempted in the past and not been successful. It was more a question of competitiveness, diversification and of how to develop downstream industries building on commodity strengths. What         2             Issued as United Nations General Assembly document A/58/401 on 2 October 2003.

Members had to be certain about the focus they wished to give the discussion in the CTD and what contribution they believed the CTD could make. Further clarification was needed to identify which commodities the Committee was to consider. Some commodities had in the past experienced declining terms of trade. That could have had a negative impact on export earnings of particular developing countries. The situation was however not identical in each individual market. Members therefore needed to decide whether they were to consider agricultural or mineral commodities, food-related commodities or non food-related commodities, tropical products or non tropical products or whether the commodities should be considered on a case-by-case basis or at a general level and whether the proponents had in mind something more limited in mind in terms of the scope of the discussion. The outcome of the Cancún Ministerial Conference had not provided Members with any additional political guidance on how to handle the issue in the future. He said that, in his view, that meant that the CTD, at that moment, had to proceed on the basis of its own resources rather than in cooperation with other WTO bodies. The CTD nevertheless had to be conscious about what was being done by other organizations in that field and what would fall within the scope of the WTO negotiating groups on agricultural and industrial products when those were reactivated.","WTCOMTDM46.pdf","European, Communities, Kenya, CTD, WTO, CTD, UNCTAD, World, Bank, IMF, CTD, Committee, United, Nations, General, Assembly, Members, CTD, CTD, Committee, Members, Cancún, Ministerial, Conference, Members, CTD, WTO, CTD, WTO"
"4983",4983,"109","109.    The representative of Switzerland said that the problem raised by the delegations of Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda was an essential problem for developing countries and for the world economy. The CTD should not consider the problem of short-term price fluctuations, although it was true that prices for some products had increased in the previous months, but consider the long-term structural problem of declining revenue for developing countries. He said that he did not believe that it made sense to talk about substance and Members' own convictions regarding the solutions before Members had agreed that the problem was important enough for the trading system and developing countries and for the WTO to become a forum for such discussions. His delegation believed that the WTO was such a forum as some of the issues were part of the negotiating agenda. He believed that the CTD could follow the consensus reached in the draft Cancún Ministerial Declaration as that paragraph had not given rise to any problems. Members could therefore assume that there was a consensus for the CTD to continue to consider the issue. When considering how to deal with the issue it was clear that some of the proposals made by the representative of Kenya were too far reaching. The Secretariat should continue its work on the issue and should make an inventory and try to find focus which could be presented to the CTD for discussion. The focus had to be restricted in terms of the types of commodities treated as well as to the types of instruments that the WTO could consider. However, that did not exclude the CTD from discussing instruments which would have to be dealt with elsewhere. The CTD should nevertheless not refer the issue to other WTO bodies which at that time did not have any mandate to continue their work. The issue was part of the DDA and Members should use the time available to take a step forward.

"4984",4984,"11","11.      The representative of Mauritius said that he was speaking on behalf of his Government, but as coordinator of the African Group wished to point out that the African Group had not yet met to discuss the document. However, he was certain that it would do so and come up with substantive reflections in due course. A large number of the components of the TA Plan catered for the needs of African countries. He would deal with both the report on the implementation of the 2003 TA Plan and the draft 2004 TA Plan together. It was important that the TA Plan continued to be based on the principles and priorities laid down in the strategy for the TA cooperation as enunciated in the Doha Ministerial Declaration. He noted that the Geneva-based trade policy courses would include a trade policy course for French speaking officials. That was important and useful because there were a large number of Francophone African Member countries. In paragraph 19 on page 5 that the Secretariat had planned regional trade policy courses for Anglophone African Member countries to be held in Nairobi, Kenya and that the venue for the course for Francophone African Member countries, was still to be determined. There were other programmes of interest to Africa such as the Joint Integrated Technical Assistance Programme (JITAP) that was well underway and which in the initial stages had been delivered to a number of African countries and which would probably be extended to other African countries. The African Group might wish to express its interest on the round table held in Tanzania, Uganda and Gambia on the Integrated Framework (IF). Among the regional seminars, the Secretariat had continued to focus on the needs of African countries in terms of working towards the needs of the Anglophone and Francophone countries. That was an important component of the 2004 TA Plan. His delegation was pleased to see that the regional seminars would cover the Uruguay Round Agreements and WTO related topics. He said that African countries were interested in the national TA and training activities spelt out in paragraph 36 of page 9 which related mainly to accessions and mainstreaming. Mention was made of assisting Members in the services negotiations an issue which needed emphasis as African countries were well behind in that process.","WTCOMTDM46.pdf","Mauritius, African, Group, African, Group, Member, Secretariat, Member, Nairobi, Kenya, Member, Africa, Joint, Integrated, Technical, Assistance, Programme, African, Group, Tanzania, Uganda, Gambia, Secretariat, Uruguay, WTO, Members"

The delegation of Kenya had then made a number of suggestions to the Committee, for it to review the problems that primary exporting countries encountered and asked the Secretariat to elaborate background documentation, including an inventory of documents and reports prepared by other organizations. The delegation of Kenya had further proposed the organization of a special session of the CTD to consider the questions mentioned in their paper and during which the Committee could decide to transmit the paper to other WTO bodies. In response to the suggestions made by the delegation of Kenya, some Members had expressed their reservation regarding the transmission of the document to other WTO bodies in light of the fact that, among other reasons, the work of those bodies had been suspended. Some members however did express an interest in having the Committee request the Secretariat to draw up an inventory of documents and reports which could be useful for a discussion in the CTD in order to avoid duplication of work undertaken by other organizations.

The representative of Nigeria said that his delegation supported the request made by the representative of Kenya and believed that a background document by the Secretariat could do justice to the topic and bring out some of the salient issues mentioned and some of the reservations made by other delegations. His delegation also supported the idea of convening a special session of the CTD with a view to consider the transmission of the issue to other WTO bodies.","WTCOMTDM46.pdf","Nigeria, Kenya, Secretariat, CTD, WTO"

"4988",4988,"113","113.    The representative of India said that Members needed to recognise the seriousness of the long-term decline in commodity prices which had been flagged by the representative of Kenya. It also had to be recognized that the subject was a legitimate concern of the WTO, and of the CTD within the WTO. The mandate of the WTO in that regard was explicit in Articles XXXVI and XXXVIII of GATT 1994. In addition, the terms of reference of the CTD left no doubt that what the Committee was considering was well within the ambit of the subjects that the CTD was supposed to deal with. In terms of how progress could be made, his delegation believed that there was a need for more analytical work by the Secretariat. A first step in that direction could be the preparation of an inventory of research papers and other documentation that had been prepared by other international organizations. He said that it would also be useful for the Secretariat to liaise more actively with other organisations such as UNCTAD and FAO which were working on the subject. His delegation also supported the idea of a special session of the CTD, but the timing was a matter that could be discussed depending on the progress the Committee could make and the background material the Secretariat could prepare.","WTCOMTDM46.pdf","India, Members, Kenya, WTO, CTD, WTO, WTO, GATT, CTD, Committee, CTD, Secretariat, Secretariat, UNCTAD, FAO, CTD, Committee, Secretariat"
"4989",4989,"114","114.    The representative of Japan said that, having acknowledged the concerns of developing countries, in particular the countries dependent on a few export commodities, his delegation wished to continue discussions on the matter. However, his delegation believed that there was still a wide gap between the proponents and the other members on how to proceed with future work on the issue. He said that his delegation therefore expressed its reservation against the establishment of a special session based on the proposals put forward by the representative of Kenya which still contained some controversial points as mentioned by the delegations of the United States, Canada and the European Communities. It would nevertheless be useful to compile documentation related to the matter for Members to get a clearer picture of the situation and consider options for future work. His delegation therefore supported the ideas mentioned by the representative of Kenya to ask the Secretariat to make such a compilation for the further discussion. His delegation considered that such an exercise would be helpful before embarking on a substantial discussion on the proposals contained in the non paper. As suggested by several delegations at the last session of the Committee, it could continue the discussions in an informal setting.","WTCOMTDM46.pdf","Japan, Kenya, United, States, Canada, Members, Kenya, Secretariat, Committee"
"4990",4990,"115","115.    The representative of Cuba reiterated her delegation's support for the proposal made by the representative of Kenya and stressed the relevance of the CTD considering those proposals. Her delegation supported the proposal for a special session dedicated to trade and commodities. That was an issue which had been left outside of the multilateral negotiating agenda and it was an important subject for a large number of Members who had seen a constant decline of their share in world trade over the past years due to their structural dependence and the drop in commodity prices for reasons that were known to all. Her delegation also supported the proposals for an inventory to be prepared by the Secretariat and the referral of the paper by the delegations of Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda to other WTO bodies. She also highlighted the importance of cooperating with other organizations that had already undertaken analysis on commodities such as UNCTAD.","WTCOMTDM46.pdf","Cuba, Kenya, CTD, Members, Secretariat, Kenya, Tanzania, Uganda, WTO, UNCTAD"
"4991",4991,"116","116.     The representative of Kenya thanked other delegations for their views and comments on the proposal made by her delegation. She said that her delegation wished to respond to and possibly clarify some of the issues and concerns raised. Regarding the legal basis for work in the WTO, and particularly work in the CTD on the stabilization of commodity prices, she said that, as was pointed                                                                                     WT/COMTD/M/46                                                                                            Page 37 out in paragraph 33 of her delegation's paper, Article XXXVIII of Part IV of the GATT specifically encouraged Members inter alia to negotiate and adopt international arrangements providing inter alia ""measures to attain stable, equitable and remunerative prices for exports of primary commodities."" That provision further provided that such arrangements provide for collaboration in matters of trade and development with UN bodies such as UNCTAD and other international financial institutions. That was a view that was shared by many Members given the inclusion of the paragraph on commodities in the draft Cancún Ministerial Declaration. That was a paragraph on which there seemed to be consensus. The main responsibility for overseeing the implementation of the provisions of Part IV of the GATT rested with the CTD. The CTD therefore had a clear mandate to discuss and agree on the measures that could be taken at the international level for the stabilization of prices for primary commodities. In undertaking such work the CTD could further request other WTO bodies, including negotiating groups, to examine the issues falling under their respective mandates and report back to the CTD on the progress made and the results achieved in their deliberations. Her delegation agreed that, under ordinary circumstances, it would be desirable for prices to be determined by free market forces. Economic theory however recognized that Governments had a legitimate obligation to intervene where there was market failure. Such market failure could occur when there was imbalance between demand and supply which was responsible for price volatility. Such situations had in the past made it necessary for interested countries to enter into arrangements for supply management by negotiating commodity agreements in which both consuming and producing countries participated, or in the alternative, by negotiating agreements or arrangements in which only producing countries participated. Her delegation agreed that past experience had shown that commodity agreements had not been successful in stabilizing prices of commodities. The economic clauses which authorized international commodity organizations like those of coffee, cocoa and sugar to intervene in the market had been suspended. While there could be many reasons for the failure of those commodity agreements, most importing processing industries in developed countries continued to benefit from the low prices and their governments had not generally been enthusiastic about allowing the buffer stocks in agencies to enter into the market with a view to averting or controlling declines in prices. As the non-paper explained in paragraph 22, the approach of developed countries on that issue appeared to be undergoing a change. It could currently be argued that there was an increasing willingness on the part of developed countries to intervene in the market to control production on a mutually advantageous basis in industrial raw materials which they produced such as steel, aluminium, and some industrial chemicals. Informal agreements to control the production of aluminium appeared to exist at present amongst major aluminium producing countries. With regards to steel, she said that negotiations for the control of production through, inter alia, the acceptance of an enhanced discipline for the use of subsidies with a view to reducing structural oversupply were underway in the OECD. In the developing world, the serious problem posed to trade and development as a result of declining prices had made producing countries give serious consideration to arrangements for supply management among producing countries. The UNCTAD Report of the Meeting of Eminent Persons on Commodity Issues noted the positive results that Malaysia and other rubber producing countries had been able to achieve following the adoption of an agreement for supply management. She said that she briefly wished to comment on the point made relating to the consistency of price stabilization measures which might involve restrictions on imports and exports with the overall objective of the WTO of promoting free trade through the elimination of barriers to trade. In her delegation's view, the objective of the WTO was to promote trade liberalization subject to the condition that it promoted development and assisted poor countries in alleviating poverty in line with the preamble to the Marrakesh Agreement. Measures taken to ensure that farmers producing primary commodities secured prices at remunerative rates in order to improve their living standards was therefore fully consistent with the objectives of the GATT and the WTO. That was specifically recognized in Part IV of the GATT which contained provisions relating to the role of trade in promoting development.","WTCOMTDM46.pdf","Kenya, WTO, CTD, GATT, Members, UN, UNCTAD, Members, Cancún, GATT, CTD, CTD, CTD, WTO, CTD, OECD, Malaysia, WTO, WTO, GATT, WTO, GATT"
"4992",4992,"117","117.    She continued by saying that concern had been raised that the paper confined itself to a narrow range of commodities to which specific reference had been made. The non-paper dealt with coffee, cocoa and sugar as those were some of the main commodities which African countries WT/COMTD/M/46 Page 38 produced and exported. However, the non-paper dealt in general terms with problems faced in trade in other commodities. Her delegation expected that requests for discussions on other products would be held in due course as the CTD commenced its discussions with interested producing countries. In conclusion, she said that her delegation believed that at that meeting Members should take a decision on the way forward in terms of how the CTD should deal with the issue of commodities Her delegation proposed that, as a starting point, the CTD request the Secretariat to prepare an inventory or bibliography of relevant documents, including a compilation of relevant work carried out by the WTO and other relevant organizations. That work would facilitate a substantial discussion in the CTD to identify long term solutions, as envisaged in the non-paper. It was in that regard that her delegation suggested that the CTD should hold a special forum. Her delegation was not aiming at the creation of a negotiating body but proposed a one day special forum for such discussions. In order to provide sufficient time for the preparation of background documentation, her delegation suggested that the special forum be held after the forthcoming CTD meeting in November 2003, or perhaps early in 2004.","WTCOMTDM46.pdf","CTD, Members, CTD, CTD, Secretariat, WTO, CTD, CTD"
"4993",4993,"118","118.     The representative of Rwanda said that his delegation supported the suggestions made by the representative of Kenya on the issue of commodities which was vital to developing country economies. The representative of Kenya had listed some commodities for which their prices had tragically declined. He mentioned the case of coffee which was important to producers in Rwanda. More than half of the export earnings of the Rwandan economy depended on the export of coffee. Coffee prices had declined and continued to do so. The question had been raised during the 50th Session of the Trade and Development Board of UNCTAD and it would soon be discussed by the United Nations in New York. As the representative of Switzerland had mentioned, the WTO could not ignore that important issue. He said that the proposals made by the representative of Kenya were plausible and warranted discussion. It was therefore important that there was a forum within the WTO to discuss the question. Members could then take decisions on how to treat the issue.","WTCOMTDM46.pdf","Rwanda, Kenya, Kenya, Rwanda, Trade, and, Development, Board, of, UNCTAD, United, Nations, New, York, Switzerland, WTO, Kenya, WTO, Members"
"4994",4994,"119","119.    The representative of Benin said that his delegation associated itself with the intervention made by the representative of Kenya. The question of declining commodity prices was crucial for developing countries and for African countries in particular as most of those countries were producers and net exporters of one or more commodities. The evolution of the world economy and Africa's share in world trade showed that urgent action had to be taken. The proposals contained in the paper by the delegations of Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda were wise, reflected the realities in the field and merited careful consideration for appropriate and sustainable solutions to be found.","WTCOMTDM46.pdf","Benin, Kenya, Africa, Kenya, Tanzania, Uganda"
"4995",4995,"12","12.      The representative of Japan said that at the Committee on Budget, Finance and Administration (Committee on BFA), it had been stated that his delegation would urge the CTD to examine and evaluate the TA activities that had been implemented before embarking on discussions regarding the 2004 TA Plan. His delegation sought clarification as to whether the TA activities planned for the remaining part of 2003 would be fully implemented according to schedule. He was reiterating those points to make Members aware of them. To avoid any misunderstanding, he would explain that in more detail. The intention was to caution against the hasty implementation of TA activities. Since there were only three months remaining in 2003, more attention needed to be paid to the expenditure on the TA activities and that did not mean just adding the numbers of implemented activities. Thus, at the Committee on BFA, his delegation had indicated its reservation on any hasty WT/COMTD/M/46 Page 4 implementation of TA activities. He expressed his delegation's appreciation to the Secretariat in preparing the first draft of the 2004 TA Plan which incorporated the comments and inputs made by both donor and beneficiary Members during its preparation process, and provided a good basis towards finalizing the 2004 TA Plan. He stressed the importance of reviewing the implemented plans while embarking on discussions on the draft 2004 TA Plan and on the projected total amount of expenditure. While his delegation appreciated the Secretariat's report on the implementation of the 2003 TA Plan as well as the Director-General's report on paragraph 41 of Doha Ministerial Declaration (WT/MIN(3)/3) submitted at the Fifth Ministerial Meeting at Cancún, it believed that a more qualitative analysis of the implemented plan was useful to embark on that exercise. In other words, his delegation would appreciate an elaboration on both the positive and negative points experienced in the delivery of the TA activities. Upon receipt of such detailed information, which should provide examples of an efficient and effective implementation of the trade-related technical assistance (TRTA) as well as areas where there was room for improvement, it would be useful to share the experiences and make use of the lessons learned before enabling any justification for the 2004 TA Plan. That feedback exercise would contribute to a more efficient and effective use of human and financial resources.","WTCOMTDM46.pdf","Japan, Committee, on, Budget, ,, Finance, and, Administration, -LRB-, Committee, BFA, CTD, Members, Committee, BFA, Secretariat, Members, Secretariat, Director-General, Cancún"
"4996",4996,"120","120.     The representative of Indonesia said that his delegation supported the proposals made by the delegations of Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda as well as the suggestion of having the issue discussed at a special forum. The reason why his delegation supported consideration of the issue of declining commodity prices in developing countries was what the authors had mentioned in paragraph 3 of their paper. He agreed with the observations made by other international organisations that some developing countries who were heavily dependent on primary commodities were becoming poorer and poorer and had become characterised as ""heavily indebted poor countries"" (HIPCs). The reasons behind the decline in the prices of primary commodities had been explained in the paper. If the CTD, or other WTO bodies, focused a discussion on the issue, Members would be able to find solutions to the problem of falling commodity prices. Developing countries should not have to depend exclusively on international loans. That would make even more countries heavily indebted. He said that he agreed with the observations that had been made by other Members that the declining prices of primary commodities should be seriously considered at the next meeting of the CTD. Developing countries would no longer depend on international loans if that problem could be resolved.","WTCOMTDM46.pdf","Indonesia, Kenya, Tanzania, Uganda, CTD, WTO, Members, Members, CTD"
"4997",4997,"121","121.     The Chairman said that there seemed to be consensus about the importance of the issue. However, there were still differences of opinion regarding the approach to be taken to remedy the situation, particularly regarding the proposal to convene a one day special forum to discuss the issue as well as its transmission to other WTO bodies. He suggested that the Committee take note of the                                                                                     WT/COMTD/M/46                                                                                            Page 39 statements made and requested the Secretariat to draw up an inventory of documents on the issue and work already done by other international organizations in other to assist Members' consideration of the issue. He further suggested that the Secretariat prepare that document for the next meeting of the Committee and that the item be kept on the agenda. He would, in the meantime, undertake informal consultations on how to proceed.","WTCOMTDM46.pdf","Chairman, WTO, Committee, Secretariat, Members, Secretariat, Committee"

The representative of the United States said that her delegation was prepared to join a consensus on the preparation of an inventory of documents and reports on the topic of trends in commodity prices. However, her delegation believed that that literature review should be a balanced compilation of materials that focused on trade-related aspects of commodity trends. The Secretariat should be instructed to gather objective analysis from research institutions not directly affiliated with Member Governments and the focus of the literature should be consistent with the trade-liberalizing aspect of the WTO mission.","WTCOMTDM46.pdf","United, States, Secretariat, Member, WTO"

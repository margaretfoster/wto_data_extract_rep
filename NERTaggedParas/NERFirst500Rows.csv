"1",1,"1","1.      At the first Session of the Committee on Trade and Development on 5 April 1995, the Chairman proposed that the draft agenda (WTO/AIR/43) be adopted. He said that discussion on the rules of procedure would take place under item B and the programme of work and institutional arrangements under item C. He proposed that, in response to requests from delegates, the Committee discuss future technical cooperation activities of the World Trade Organization (WTO), under agenda item D, Other business. The representative of India said his delegation would like to discuss the terms of reference of the Committee on Trade and Development under Other business. The Committee then adopted the agenda.

"2",2,"10","10.    The representative of the United States supported the draft Programme of Work; it was ambitious and very well organized. He thought it was necessary to ensure that work carried out under Items C and D was not duplicated in other international organizations. He called for the circulation of documents to Members well in advance of the meeting of the Committee on Trade and Development. The Chairman recalled that it had been agreed that documents would be circulated four weeks in advance of Committee on Trade and Development meetings.

"3",3,"11","11.     The representative of Argentina queried whether the draft Programme of Work properly reflected the input the WTO should make in the work programme of the ITC and other international organizations dealing with trade issues. He said that, as described in the Informal Note circulated by the Secretariat, it was his understanding that the future orientation of the technical cooperation activities included the follow-up of the programme of work of bodies such as the ITC. The representative of Venezuela supported the query by representative of Argentina. The Chairman said that, in his personal opinion, the mandate given to the Committee on Trade and Development was broad enough to permit it to engage in any discussions or negotiations on the subject; the matter could be discussed further, later on in the proceedings.","WTCOMTDM1.pdf","Argentina, WTO, ITC, Secretariat, ITC, Venezuela, Argentina, Chairman, Committee, on, Trade, and, Development"
"4",4,"12","12.     The representative of Japan thought the provision of technical assistance to developing countries was important in facilitating their integration into the multilateral trading system. GATT/WTO was providing technical assistance to developing countries to assist them to comply with their obligations under the Marrakesh Agreement. He called for closer collaboration with the ITC and UNCTAD to ensure that the limited resources earmarked for technical cooperation and assistance were put to good use.","WTCOMTDM1.pdf","Japan, GATT/WTO, ITC, UNCTAD"
"5",5,"13","13.      The Chairman proposed a distribution of the individual items in the Programme of Work for each meeting of the Committee on Trade and Development in 1995. The present meeting would tackle: (i) organizational matters, (ii) institutional arrangements, and (iii) technical cooperation (i.e. item C of the Programme of Work). The second meeting would (i) review the impact of the results of the Uruguay Round on developing country Members, in particular the least-developed country Members, (ii) consider measures and initiatives to assist in the expansion of trade and investment opportunities for developing countries, especially the least-developed ones, (iii) address the question of credit and recognition for autonomous trade liberalization measures, and (iv) consider technical cooperation activities of the WTO. The third meeting of the Committee on Trade and Development would consider (i) the participation of developing country Members in the multilateral trading system, (ii) WTO's technical cooperation activities as they relate to developing country Members (in consultation with other relevant WTO bodies), and (iii) the application of special provisions in the Multilateral Trade Agreements and related Ministerial Decisions in favour of developing country Members, especially the least-developed ones.","WTCOMTDM1.pdf","Chairman, Committee, on, Trade, and, Development, Uruguay, Members, Members, WTO, Committee, on, Trade, and, Development, Members, WTO, Members, WTO, Members"
"6",6,"14","14.    In the absence of comments, the Programme of Work was adopted. The Chairman urged Members having any views on the Programme of Work to make written submissions by June. He drew Members' attention to the Secretariat document on notification (WT/COM.TD/W/1) and said they may wish to comment under item D of the agenda - technical cooperation .         (iii)    Sub-Committee on Least-Developed Countries","WTCOMTDM1.pdf","Chairman, Members, Members, Secretariat"
"7",7,"15","15.      The Chairman recommended the establishment of a Sub-Committee on Least-Developed Countries. If a Sub-Committee was established, responsibility for all items on the agenda of the Committee on Trade and Development concerning least-developed countries would be referred to it. He suggested that Miss Anne Stoddart of the United Kingdom be appointed Chairperson of the Sub- Committee. He invited delegations who may have views on the nomination to convey them to him. The representative of Argentina, on behalf of the Informal Group of Developing Countries, expressed support for Miss Anne Stoddart. The representative of Bangladesh preferred that a decision on the Chairmanship of the Sub-Committee be taken at the present meeting. In response to the suggestion by the representative of Bangladesh the Chairman thought it appropriate to give delegations time to reflect on his proposal with respect to Miss Stoddart's nomination.

Drawing attention to the informal note prepared by the Chairman on the draft Terms of Reference of the Sub-Committee, the representative of Hong Kong suggested the following amendments; in indent (a) there could be an enumeration of the specific needs of LDC's; in the first line of indent (b) the appropriate word was ""operation""; in indent (b) a reference to Ministerial Declarations and Decisions could be added, as to refer only to Multilateral Trade Agreements was too restrictive. Thanking the representative of Hong Kong for his valuable suggestions, the Chairman said that the observations would be taken up during informal consultations on the terms of reference.

"9",9,"17","17.     The Chairman said that providing guidelines to WTO technical assistance for developing countries was one of the important items of the terms of reference of the Committee on Trade and Development. Expressing his appreciation for the informal note distributed by the Secretariat, he said that, after preliminary discussions at this meeting, discussions would resume at the June meeting.","WTCOMTDM1.pdf","Chairman, WTO, Committee, on, Trade, and, Development, Secretariat"
"10",10,"18","18.     The representative of Argentina, speaking on behalf of the Informal Group of Developing Countries, said that developing countries, the main beneficiaries of technical assistance, had reached a consensus on the question of technical assistance in the WTO. They were presenting the following points as a contribution to the debate. (1) Developing countries believed that there should be an increase in the resources of the Secretariat commensurate with the broadening of the responsibilities of the WTO compared with those of the GATT; the considerably increased membership (once ratification and accession procedures were completed) meant that requests for technical assistance were increasing and would increase even more in the future. (2) Developing countries expressed their appreciation for the technical cooperation and training activities of the Secretariat. (3) Developing countries unanimously supported the Secretariat proposal for a special action plan for African countries and the least-developed countries. (4) Developing countries placed importance on technical assistance and cooperation with respect to notification requirements and changes in legislation required to fulfil obligations arising from the Marrakesh Agreements. Document WT/COM.TD/W/1 showed the complexity of the notification requirements, and what needed to be done; it was clear that a special programme of assistance would be needed from the Secretariat. (5) They requested the Secretariat to organize a workshop devoted to questions relating to notification obligations and changes needed in domestic rules and legislation to comply with the Marrakesh Agreements. This workshop could also be open to developed countries. (6) Developing countries wanted a detailed discussion on the technical cooperation activities of the Secretariat at the June meeting, and requested a special agenda item on the issue.","WTCOMTDM1.pdf","Argentina, Informal, Group, of, Developing, Countries, WTO, Secretariat, WTO, GATT, Secretariat, Secretariat, Secretariat, Secretariat, Secretariat"
"11",11,"19","19.       The representative of Venezuela said that, as stated by his delegation many times before, providing technical cooperation activities should be among the first obligations of the WTO. While the WTO Secretariat was the most competent source for technical cooperation, Venezuela did not believe that it could respond to all the needs of developing countries; other organizations - such as UNCTAD and ITC - had supplementary and complementary activities in this field. The role of these two organizations was particularly important with respect to seminars to study commitments deriving from the Uruguay Round. Seminars on specific topics related to the Uruguay Round should continue to have a special place on the agenda of WTO technical cooperation activities. He went on that cooperation between the Secretariats of the WTO and other intergovernmental organizations was essential; technical cooperation activities required adequate planning and flexibility to get the maximum benefit from resources. As an example, he said that when an official was sent to a country for a seminar, other countries of the region could benefit from his presence and arrange similar activities. This would have regional benefits and a spill-over/multiplying effect. Participation of the WTO officials in seminars WT/COMTD/M/1 Page 6 organized by other institutions would use minimum resources with maximum results. The proposal to establish a plan of action for Africa and the least-developed countries recognized that the Secretariat had a fundamental role to play. He underlined the importance of consultations on technical cooperation activities even if they were time-consuming and did not form part of the activities themselves.","WTCOMTDM1.pdf","Venezuela, WTO, WTO, Secretariat, Venezuela, UNCTAD, ITC, Uruguay, Round, Uruguay, Round, WTO, WTO, WTO, Page, 6, Africa, Secretariat"
"12",12,"2","2.       The Chairman said that paragraph 2 of Article IV of the Marrakesh Agreement Establishing the World Trade Organization requires the rules of procedure of the Committee on Trade and Development to be approved by the General Council. He thought that, following the precedent that had been established by other WTO bodies, the rules of procedure of the Committee on Trade and Development should follow closely those of the General Council. He described the first two proposed changes: (a) the Committee on Trade and Development would meet three times a year, with the possibility of convening extraordinary meetings (Rule 1); and, (b) normal meetings would be convened with a notice of four weeks (Rule 2). He invited Members to comment on the draft rules of procedure circulated by the Secretariat. The representative of Morocco inquired whether it would not be better to specify the months during which the Committee on Trade and Development would meet, as for example had been done by the Committee on Agriculture. The Chairman said the issue would be dealt with when addressing the Programme of Work; he was of the view that Members should have the flexibility of deciding when to meet.","WTCOMTDM1.pdf","Chairman, World, Trade, Organization, Committee, on, Trade, and, Development, General, Council, WTO, Committee, on, Trade, and, Development, General, Council, Committee, on, Trade, and, Development, Members, Secretariat, Morocco, Committee, on, Trade, and, Development, Committee, on, Agriculture, Chairman, Members"
"13",13,"20","20.     The representative of Bangladesh fully supported the statement by the representative of Argentina, on behalf of the Informal Group of Developing Countries. He thought the workshop on notifications and required changes in legislation should be arranged as soon as possible; he suggested that officials from capitals, who would ultimately have to do the work, be invited.","WTCOMTDM1.pdf","Bangladesh, Argentina, Informal, Group, of, Developing, Countries"
"14",14,"21","21.      The representative of Indonesia, speaking on behalf of ASEAN countries, said a workshop would greatly assist developing countries with notification requirements arising from the WTO Agreements and he agreed that officials from capitals be invited to participate. ASEAN countries, he said, supported the regular training activities held in Geneva and proposed, for cost/benefit reasons, that the WTO Secretariat send its experts to participate in seminars organized by regional groups. ASEAN countries thought cooperation in providing technical assistance to developing countries, between the WTO and other international organizations such as ITC and UNCTAD, should be increased. He emphasized the importance of avoiding duplication, and of technical cooperation and assistance activities being cost-effective.","WTCOMTDM1.pdf","Indonesia, ASEAN, WTO, ASEAN, Geneva, WTO, Secretariat, ASEAN, WTO, ITC, UNCTAD"
"15",15,"22","22.      The representative of Switzerland said his country's support for technical cooperation could be seen from bilateral assistance offered to developing countries and assistance to activities undertaken by international and intergovernmental organizations. The lack of adequate resources prevented the consensus that existed on the need to strengthen technical assistance being translated into action. His delegation agreed, as stated by the representative of Argentina, on behalf of the Informal Group of Developing Countries, that the responsibilities of the WTO had broadened because of increased obligations and the increased number of countries wishing to become Members. Switzerland recognized the quality and competence of the training provided by the Secretariat, an area in which they financed a number of activities. Technical cooperation undertaken in the WTO should continue to be organized with cooperation and coordination among Divisions so as to ensure that maximum benefit is derived from available resources. The need for such coordination would undoubtedly be discussed in other Committees, particularly when the structure of the Secretariat was discussed by the Committee on Budget, Finance and Administration. It was essential to have a vision of all the needs; to define priorities in coordination with intergovernmental organizations which undertook similar activities, such as the ITC, UNCTAD, the World Bank and the IMF. He thought the Technical Cooperation and Training Division should revise its paper, placing WTO activities in a global context. In view of the financial difficulties of many donor countries, synergies between the WTO and other organizations should be increased so as to yield maximum benefit from available resources.","WTCOMTDM1.pdf","Switzerland, Argentina, Informal, Group, of, Developing, Countries, WTO, Members, Switzerland, Secretariat, WTO, Secretariat, Committee, on, Budget, ,, Finance, and, Administration, ITC, UNCTAD, World, Bank, IMF, Technical, Cooperation, and, Training, Division, WTO, WTO"
"16",16,"23","23.      The representative of Egypt called on the Committee on Trade and Development to contribute to the discussions in the Committee on Budget, Finance and Administration by clearly identifying technical assistance needs. The representative of Côte d'Ivoire shared the views expressed by the representative of Argentina, on behalf of the Informal Group of Developing Countries. Her delegation was concerned that regional seminars very often did not encourage the participation of experts from sub-regional economic organizations. She suggested that in future they be invited to attend these seminars; they could also serve to help the Secretariat in training and providing information, and could help in standardizing regulations in most regions, especially in sub-Saharan Africa, bringing them in line with the WTO provisions. The Chairman said the Secretariat would take note of her suggestions and bear them in mind when organizing future activities.","WTCOMTDM1.pdf","Egypt, Committee, on, Trade, and, Development, Committee, on, Budget, ,, Finance, and, Administration, Argentina, Informal, Group, of, Developing, Countries, Secretariat, Africa, WTO, Chairman, Secretariat"
"17",17,"24","24.      The representative of the United States expressed appreciation for the technical cooperation activities of the WTO for developing countries, particularly for least-developed countries. He expressed                                                                             WT/COMTD/M/1                                                                             Page 7 interest in future activities outlined in the Secretariat's paper and asked for further details. Like other delegations, the U.S. was interested in further cooperation between the WTO and other intergovernmental organizations including WIPO.","WTCOMTDM1.pdf","United, States, WTO, Secretariat, U.S., WTO, WIPO"
"18",18,"25","25.      The representative of the European Communities fully supported the technical cooperation activities of the Secretariat. He said the EC also provided assistance on a bilateral basis. In this regard the EC was committed to the Marrakesh Declaration and other Decisions. Several steps were necessary to ensure the wide participation of developing countries in the Uruguay Round Agreements. It was important to have the right priorities, and ratification of the Agreements along with the finalization of schedules, was an area where the EC has been providing assistance. Developing country Members needed to participate actively in the work of the various Committees. The EC was of the view that there should be a clear identification of the technical assistance needs and the priorities of developing countries. The statement by the representative of Argentina, on behalf of the Informal Group of Developing Countries, was interesting and some ideas should be further developed.","WTCOMTDM1.pdf","Secretariat, EC, EC, Uruguay, EC, Members, EC, Argentina, Informal, Group, of, Developing, Countries"
"19",19,"26","26.      The representative of Senegal said his country has received much support in the area of technical assistance. The national seminar held in October 1994 had facilitated ratification by the Parliament. He welcomed the note on technical cooperation and stressed the importance of the orientation of technical cooperation activities in the future and the need for increasing the share devoted to Africa. Technical assistance in trade matters was also broader and more complex than before, as trade had direct linkages with many other sectors - e.g. transport, customs services, telecommunications. He said accompanying measures would need to be taken in all these areas to ensure that efforts went in the right direction and that the trade efficiency of African countries grew. He then made three proposals. First, the WTO should extend its activities, and better coordinate them with ITC. This could be an effective and high performance tool at the service of WTO Members. Second, the Secretariat should catalogue the multiple needs of countries for technical assistance along with the States and international organizations able to meet these needs. Third, the Secretariat must be strengthened and given the means for the financing and staffing required to implement its policies. He noted that while a number of delegations wished to strengthen the Secretariat, others thought the Secretariat could do better and more without increased resources. While it was important to agree on the future focus and orientation of technical cooperation activities, he feared that the WTO would simply manage the present without preparing for the future. The role of the Committee on Trade and Development was to have a broad view of all the likely problems. The representative of Switzerland supported the proposal by Senegal that the Secretariat draw up a catalogue of technical cooperation needs and of the ""offers in the market"".","WTCOMTDM1.pdf","Senegal, Parliament, Africa, WTO, ITC, WTO, Members, Secretariat, States, Secretariat, Secretariat, Secretariat, WTO, Committee, on, Trade, and, Development, Switzerland, Senegal, Secretariat"
"20",20,"27","27.      The Chairman noted the comments on technical cooperation and training activities and agreed to revert to this matter at the next meeting. He encouraged delegations to come to the next meeting with constructive ideas to improve the technical cooperation programmes. He then asked delegates whether they agreed to the proposal made by the representative of Argentina that the Secretariat organize as soon as possible a workshop on notification obligations and on other implementation obligations, open to both developing and developed countries. Mr. Jesús Seade, Deputy Director-General, said that such a workshop could be organized within the existing budget. The Chairman said officials from capitals would also be invited to attend the workshop, at their own expense. The Chairman said the agreement of the Committee on Trade and Development to this proposal would be transmitted on an urgent basis to the Secretariat.","WTCOMTDM1.pdf","Chairman, Argentina, Secretariat, Jesús, Seade, Director-General, Chairman, Chairman, Committee, on, Trade, and, Development, Secretariat"
"21",21,"28","28.     The representative of Argentina, speaking on behalf of the Informal Group of Developing Countries, then spoke on the question of technical cooperation and the ITC. First, the Group recommended that the Chairman of the General Council forward the informal note on the ITC by the Secretariat, dated 16 March 1995, to the ITC Secretariat with the following three comments: (i) that there was agreement on the importance of ITC cooperating with the private sector in developing countries; (ii) that a central element of ITC technical cooperation activities should continue to be WT/COMTD/M/1 Page 8 to strengthen the institutional basis in developing countries for undertaking trade promotion activities -  an area where the ITC had considerable experience; and (iii) that duplication should be avoided with respect to other international organizations when implementing such a work plan. Second, the Group was asking the Chairman of the Committee on Trade and Development to undertake consultations, in the coming weeks, with the main donors of ITC and other interested countries: (i) on providing effective contributions to the next biennial work programme of the ITC which would be discussed in the forthcoming Joint Advisory Group; and (ii) on the possibility of creating a permanent working group to deal specifically with the work programme of the ITC, and possibly the work programme of other international organizations.","WTCOMTDM1.pdf","Argentina, Informal, Group, of, Developing, Countries, ITC, Group, Chairman, General, Council, ITC, Secretariat, ITC, Secretariat, ITC, ITC, ITC, Group, Chairman, Committee, on, Trade, and, Development, ITC, ITC, Joint, Advisory, Group, ITC"
"22",22,"29","29.     The representative of India requested the Chairman's consultations be held as early as possible; it was important to signal the importance of the ITC for all WTO Members. The representative of Switzerland said that as a major donor, Switzerland had taken note of the very concrete and interesting proposals made by the representative of Argentina. He stated that discussions on the work programme could not ignore financial realities. He drew attention to the fact that the contribution of the WTO to ITC accounted for around 17 per cent of the budget of the WTO.","WTCOMTDM1.pdf","India, Chairman, ITC, WTO, Members, Switzerland, Switzerland, Argentina, WTO, ITC, WTO"
"23",23,"3","3.       The Chairman then went on to other proposed amendments: no proposed agenda would be circulated other than that contained in the airgram which would be used to convene meetings of the Committee on Trade and Development (Rule 5); there would be no vice-chairman, following the practice under GATT 1947; a decision had not yet been taken on whether to establish a Sub-Committee on Least-Developed Countries (so Rule 12bis was in brackets); and, matters on which a decision could not be arrived at by consensus at the Committee on Trade and Development would be referred to the General Council for a decision (Rule 33). The representative of the European Communities suggested that, for the sake of consistency, the word ""session"" in the first sentence of the proposed Rule 12bis should be replaced by ""meeting"". The Chairman said this comment would be taken into account in revising the document.

The Chairman clarified that, in light of the ongoing consultations between the Chairman of the General Council and ITC, the first point raised by the representative of Argentina would be communicated to the Chairman of the General Council. With respect to the second point made by the representative of Argentina, he stated that the consultations would be of a very informal nature; they would be done also in his capacity as Chairman of the Joint Advisory Group, and with the hope that they would contribute to the work of the Chairman of the General Council. The Committee took note of the statements made.","WTCOMTDM1.pdf","Chairman, Chairman, General, Council, ITC, Argentina, Chairman, General, Council, Argentina, Chairman, Joint, Advisory, Group, Chairman, General, Council, Committee"
"25",25,"31","31.      The representative of India indicated that his delegation had a proposal to make concerning the terms of reference of the Committee on Trade and Development. The GATT 1947 Committee on Trade and Development had a mandate divided in two parts - the terms of reference themselves and a mandate deriving from a Decision of 1979 to strengthen the role of the Committee. Among the items included in the latter, there was the ""examination of protective action by developed countries against imports from developing countries."" Unfortunately, this important item did not figure in the terms of reference of the Committee on Trade and Development in the WTO. He stated that India would like to see this mandate explicitly listed among the terms of reference of the Committee on Trade and Development. Nobody, he said, could dispute that the Committee on Trade and Development was the right forum in the WTO to deal with this item. He expected a reaction to this proposal at the next meeting. He then asked for a confirmation that the Committee on Trade and Development was empowered on the basis of consensus, to establish or to reconvene Sub-Committees.","WTCOMTDM1.pdf","Committee, on, Trade, and, Development, GATT, Committee, on, Trade, and, Development, Committee, Committee, on, Trade, and, Development, WTO, India, Committee, on, Trade, and, Development, Committee, on, Trade, and, Development, WTO, Committee, on, Trade, and, Development"
"26",26,"32","32.      The Chairman confirmed that the Committee on Trade and Development had the power to establish Sub-Committees. He urged delegations to give serious consideration to India's proposal; he called on India to elaborate its proposal perhaps through a written communication. The representative of Venezuela indicated his delegation's support to India's proposal. The Committee took note of the statements made and agreed to revert to this question at its next meeting.

"28",28,"4","4.       The Chairman went on to the proposed amendments to Rules 36 and 36bis; that the Committee on Trade and Development present a yearly report to the General Council, which would be prepared, following the last meeting of the Committee on Trade and Development, by the Chairman with the assistance of the Secretariat. This report would be distributed as a ""Spec"" document, and comments invited from Members. If no comments were forthcoming, the Report would be deemed to have been adopted. The representative of Mexico agreed with the proposed amendment to Rule 36bis. However, in Rule 36, his delegation wished to maintain the footnotes used in the Rules of Procedure of the General Council. The representative of the United States said that his delegation agreed with the proposed amendment to Rule 36bis. He stated that extraordinary meetings could be convened when necessary to discuss the draft report. The Chairman agreed with the proposal by the representative of the U.S. and added that he intended to submit the rules of procedure of the Committee on Trade and Development to the General Council for approval.

The Chairman said that in accordance with the Ad Hoc Procedures on Participation of Certain International Organizations in the Work of the WTO Bodies, the Committee on Trade and Development had invited to its first meeting all those organizations which had observer status in the comparable GATT 1947 body. Recalling the decision of the Informal Meeting of Heads of Delegation which had authorized ""each of the subsidiary bodies of the General Council ... to decide on an ad hoc basis at each meeting which intergovernmental organizations they wished to invite as observers to their next meeting"", the Chairman said the Committee on Trade and Development should decide which organizations to invite to the next meeting which was scheduled for June of this year. He proposed that the organizations which attended the first meeting be invited. The representative of Switzerland said the ITC should be granted observer status in the Committee on Trade and Development, especially considering the input it could offer in the technical cooperation activities of the WTO. The Chairman indicated that the Committee would need to revert to this issue once the General Council completed its work on the formulation of guidelines for observer status.

"30",30,"6","6.      The Chairman said that Item 6 of the Terms of Reference of the WTO Committee on Trade and Development required the Committee to establish a programme of work, which might be reviewed as necessary each year. Drawing the attention of delegations to the draft prepared by the Secretariat (WT/COM.TD/W/2), he explained that two elements had been added to those already included in the Terms of Reference: (i) ""the review of the impact of the results of the Uruguay Round on developing country Members, in particular on the least-developed country Members"", and (ii) the ""examination of the question of credit and recognition for autonomous trade liberalization measures"".","WTCOMTDM1.pdf","Chairman, WTO, Committee, on, Trade, and, Development, Committee, Secretariat, Uruguay, Members, Members"
"31",31,"7","7.      The representative of Tunisia said that with the creation of the WTO, the Committee on Trade and Development had to discharge more onerous responsibilities, and hoped that Members of the WTO would continue to work together to ensure the realisation of the objectives of the Marrakesh Agreement. Stressing the need to ensure the incorporation of developing countries, especially the least-developed ones, into the multilateral trading system, he commended the Secretariat for drawing up a harmonious and well-thought out draft Programme of Work. The Committee on Trade and Development must ensure, he said, that clauses and other provisions in favour of developing countries enshrined in the WTO Agreement were implemented; this would not only enhance the credibility of the WTO, but enable it to fulfil its mandate and ensure that the aims of the founding fathers were respected. Citing passages from the Marrakesh Agreement on the need for positive measures to assist least-developed                                                                             WT/COMTD/M/1                                                                             Page 3 countries and developing countries who are net-food importers, he welcomed the Chairman's suggestion that the Committee on Trade and Development keep this subject under consideration. He thought the Committee on Trade and Development should always consider the impact of GATT Part IV and the Enabling Clause. Speaking for the African group, he underlined the need to implement the measures in favour of least-developed countries, and contribute to an expansion of their trading opportunities and their integration into the multilateral trading system. He supported the Chairman's proposal that a Sub-Committee on Least-Developed Countries be established; the comparable body under GATT 1947 had done a splendid job. He went on to stress the indispensability of technical assistance, calling for increased technical cooperation and assistance to developing countries, especially the least-developed ones. He alluded to the problem of inadequate human and financial resources of the WTO, and reminded delegates that the Marrakesh Agreement specifically called for increased technical assistance, and the strengthening of GATT/WTO's capacity to provide technical assistance. For technical assistance to be effective, he said it is important to be clear about three elements: the objective(s) to be achieved, the means for achieving such objectives and an assessment of the likely problems. Without such an approach and orientation, any technical assistance strategy was likely to fail. He welcomed the priority that had been given by the WTO to African countries in the field of technical cooperation and assistance. African Trade Ministers meeting in Tunisia had called for increased technical cooperation and assistance to their countries to help them discharge their increased obligations under the WTO Agreement. Tunisia, speaking for the African group, would continue to press, in the Committee on Trade Development, the Budget Committee and other bodies, for increased financial and human resources for the Secretariat so it could broaden its technical assistance and cooperation activities to developing countries, especially the least-developed countries, many of whom belong to the African continent. Concluding, he said that for Africa to become a fully fledged partner in world trade, it must continue to receive technical assistance and cooperation.","WTCOMTDM1.pdf","Tunisia, WTO, Committee, on, Trade, and, Development, Members, WTO, Secretariat, Committee, on, Trade, and, Development, WTO, WTO, Page, Chairman, Committee, on, Trade, and, Development, Committee, on, Trade, and, Development, GATT, Chairman, GATT, WTO, GATT/WTO, WTO, Tunisia, WTO, Tunisia, Committee, on, Trade, Development, Budget, Committee, Secretariat, Africa"

The Secretariat responded that the Committee on Trade and Development, as a subsidiary body of the General Council, was obliged to account to the General Council on its activities; it therefore appeared superfluous to add that a report should be prepared for the General Council. The representatives of the European Communities and Argentina agreed with the Secretariat's reasoning.

"37",37,"11","11.      The Director-General of the WTO said that he considered the participation of the Chairman of the Joint IMF/World Bank Development Committee in the WTO's Committee on Trade and Development not only a sign of closer coordination but also yet another sign of the growing importance of trade for economic development. Ahead were many challenges, and many unprecedented opportunities. The growing interdependence of countries could not be stopped. One quarter of world trade today was on account of developing countries; one-third of the most important importers and exporters were developing countries. Twenty years ago, 5 per cent of developed country imports came from developing countries; this figure grew to 15 per cent in 1990. Today it was 20 per cent and was projected to increase to 25 per cent in the years ahead. In 1995, annual sales of foreign affiliates of multinational corporations were estimated to exceed the value of traded goods and services which were over 6,000 billion dollars. Foreign direct investment inflows had increased to over 300 billion dollars, about one-third of it to developing countries with 10 countries absorbing about 80 per cent of the total. Once the Uruguay Round Results would be fully implemented, 40 per cent of industrialized countries' imports would be duty free. This was the perspective of the growing interdependence between developed and developing countries. In its recent report, UNCTAD had pointed out that once again growth in developing countries exceeded that in developed countries, and for the first time served as WT/COMTD/M/10 Page 6 the motor for growth. Of real significance was that the outlook for growth in African countries was positive and that in the past two years, some had achieved growth rates of 5 per cent or more. This showed that it was possible to change even the most difficult reality. The relationship was changing between developed and developing countries, with both becoming increasingly interdependent. Developing country markets were important for industrialized countries. Economic growth in developing countries was important for the industrialized countries' own growth and, hence, it was in their own interest to ensure continued market access into their markets for exports from developing countries. At the same time, developed countries would be faced with the need for structural adjustment. A recent report of UNCTAD projected that in the next ten years 12 per cent of manufacturing employment in developed countries would be affected by imports from developing countries. Growth in developing countries had thus an impact on growth in developed countries, and the relationship was no longer one between donor and beneficiary. Trade was an important element in the growth strategy, more than aid: as the prospects for aid weakened, the importance of trade increased. Interdependence cannot just be trade. It covers also investment. Important interlinkages between trade and investment would be analysed in the annual report of the WTO this year. Investment policy was very important for a development strategy. Investment flows brought transfer of technology, management capacity and know-how, particularly for the poorest countries. Liberalization was not a concession, regardless of whether it was undertaken by developed or developing countries; the logic of change required countries to go forward in partnership. The telecommunications sector was a clear example. Liberalization in this sector would be in the common interest: no economic future was possible without the technological advances in telecommunications. The Director-General emphasized once again the common interest of countries as reflected in the interdependent relationship, and said that it would be reinforced by work in this Committee to further the integration of developing countries in the multilateral trading system.","WTCOMTDM10.pdf","Director-General, WTO, Chairman, Joint, IMF/World, Bank, Development, Committee, WTO, Committee, on, Trade, and, Development, Uruguay, UNCTAD, UNCTAD, WTO, Director-General, Committee"
"38",38,"12","12.     The Director-General went on to say that the problems faced by least-developed countries represented a failure on the part of the international community and posed a big challenge. He recalled his proposals to the G7 countries gathered at Lyon earlier this year, in particular, first, to extend duty free access for all products exported by least-developed; second, to implement measures to improve the investment flows to the poorest countries; third, to improve coordination, not only with UNCTAD and ITC, but also with multilateral financial institutions, using new technologies to increase technical assistance with a view to strengthening LLDCs' human and institutional capacity. He hoped that these three points could be included in the discussions in Singapore. He noted that the Singapore Ministerial Conference represented only one step, albeit an important one, in the process of building a world trading system. He hoped that the Ministers would send a strong and united message.","WTCOMTDM10.pdf","Director-General, Lyon, UNCTAD, ITC, Singapore, Singapore, Ministerial, Conference"
"39",39,"13","13.       The representative of the European Communities congratulated the Chairman for his dynamic role in trying to achieve a large degree of consensus on questions to be submitted to Ministers at Singapore. The integration into the world economy and into the multilateral trading system of, in particular, the least-developed countries was of concern not only to this Committee but also to his delegation. The Member States of the European Communities had been clear at their recent Council in Dublin, held in preparation of the Singapore meeting. There were various ways to help the least developed countries. While debt-related issues were outside the mandate of the WTO, its technical assistance activities clearly were a means of assisting least-developed countries in efforts to implement their obligations resulting from the Uruguay Round. His delegation intended to enhance the WTO technical assistance activities through bilateral and multilateral initiatives. He said that the role of foreign direct investment in least-developed countries should not be underestimated and his delegation hoped that this matter would be addressed by Ministers in the Singapore in a satisfying manner. His delegation had taken note of the DG's proposal to the G7 countries in Lyon and was considering it carefully, in particular the proposal relating to tariffs. His delegation considered cooperation between the WTO,                                                                                      WT/COMTD/M/10                                                                                      Page 7 IMF and World Bank, to which Mr. El Kabbaj had alluded, indispensable and fully supported efforts to strengthen it.","WTCOMTDM10.pdf","European, Communities, Chairman, Singapore, Committee, Member, Council, Dublin, Singapore, WTO, Uruguay, Round, WTO, Singapore, DG, Lyon, WTO, IMF, World, Bank, El, Kabbaj"
"40",40,"14","14.       The representative of Tanzania thanked the Chairman for his role in ensuring the presence at this meeting of Mr. El Kabbaj, who played an important role in the international financial system. The Minister's address had enhanced his delegation's understanding of the role of the Development Committee, as well as the possible role of the Bretton Woods institutions in assisting countries which remained on the periphery of the multilateral system. As a result of the Chairman's initiative to invite the Heads of the WTO, UNCTAD and ITC to address the Seventh Session of the Committee, last June, a national seminar would be held shortly in Tanzania. He drew the attention to the role of institutions other than the WTO in implementing the results of the Uruguay Round and the Ministerial Declarations, such as the one concerning net-food importing countries, and the Decision calling for greater coherence in global economic policy. He had often stressed the need for capacity building in the least-developed countries, which also entailed the involvement of institutions other than the WTO. He welcomed the reference made by Mr. El Kabbaj to the need to address the debt problem of the least-developed countries, as this was the problem which most undermined the possibility of any progress. Multilateral debt constituted a sizeable proportion of the total debt and he was encouraged by the prospect that new initiatives would be taken by the IMF/World Bank Development Committee. He hoped that such initiatives would be broad-based and comprehensive. Investments in infrastructure projects by institution such as the IDA were necessary to create an investment-friendly environment. He was concerned about the decrease in resources at IDA's disposal and stressed the importance of their replenishment at an adequate level, and in a consistent and predictable manner. According to an UNCTAD report, a decline in flows to least-developed countries of 1.2 billion dollars had occurred; African countries had received only 1.6 per cent of the flows to developing countries. He welcomed the Director-General's commitment to least-developed countries and his initiative to propose a zero tariff applicable to exports from least-developed countries. He stressed however, that, in order to benefit from such initiatives, they should go hand in hand with efforts to enhance human and institutional capacity building in least- developed countries.","WTCOMTDM10.pdf","Tanzania, Chairman, El, Kabbaj, Development, Committee, Chairman, WTO, UNCTAD, ITC, Committee, Tanzania, WTO, Uruguay, Round, WTO, El, Kabbaj, IMF/World, Bank, Development, Committee, IDA, IDA, UNCTAD, Director-General"

The representative of Egypt stressed the significance of the presence of the Chairman of the IMF/World Bank Development Committee and thanked the Chairman for revitalising the CTD. Her government fully supported the WTO Director-General's efforts to achieve a closer cooperation with the IMF and the World Bank, as such cooperation was essential for a greater coherence in global economic policy-making. Fluctuations in world interest rates and exchange rates, their frequency and magnitude, as well as their outstanding debt burden, depressed the volume and value of exports from developing countries. She recalled that developing countries had hoped that such issues would have been dealt with more comprehensively in the Marrakesh Declaration. She looked forward to support from the Joint IMF/World Bank Development Committee in achieving greater cooperation between the Bretton Woods institutions and the WTO, with a view to ensuring the monetary and financial stability necessary for a stable trade flow. A link between the international financial institutions and the WTO's Trade Policy Review Mechanism should lead to strengthened multilateral surveillance, in particular of the major economies. She furthermore noted that, even though the joint IMF/World Bank Committee was a consultative body, it could use its weight in the decision-making process. She agreed with the representative of the European Communities, that coordination between institutions was indispensable.","WTCOMTDM10.pdf","Egypt, Chairman, IMF/World, Bank, Development, Committee, Chairman, CTD, WTO, Director-General, IMF, World, Bank, Joint, IMF/World, Bank, Development, Committee, WTO, WTO, Trade, Policy, Review, Mechanism, IMF/World, Bank, Committee"

He recalled the Director- General's intervention with respect to the interlinkages in the world economy and agreed that, as globalization and liberalization led to greater integration, they also led to greater imbalances. Technical assistance was one way of coping with the challenges presented by such imbalances. Increased coordination among international institutions could rationalize and optimize technical assistance. He WT/COMTD/M/10 Page 8 hoped that the priority given to the neediest countries in delivering such assistance would not be at the expense of countries such as his to meet growing challenges.","WTCOMTDM10.pdf","Paraguay, Chairman, El, Kabbaj, Development, Committee, Director"

He welcomed the thought-provoking ideas of Mr. El Kabbaj, particularly with regard to the need for improved market access for developing countries and least-developed countries as a means of greater integration. His government had a profound interest in the role and functioning of the Joint IMF/World Bank Development Committee and he stressed the importance of maintaining flexibility in the exercise of national sovereignty in foreign policy formulation as developing and least- developed countries faced greater globalization. In this context he suggested that the conclusions of the recent UNDP World Development Report, in particular to the effect that globalization had resulted in greater marginalization of least-developed and developing countries, be discussed in the CTD.","WTCOMTDM10.pdf","India, Director-General, Chairman, El, Kabbaj, Joint, IMF/World, Bank, Development, Committee, UNDP, World, Development, CTD"

As such, the meeting was yet another symbol of the growing cooperation between the WTO and other international organizations, and an expression of the CTD's mandate to serve as a focal point for consideration and coordination of work on development in the WTO and its relationship with development related activities in other multilateral agencies. In that context, he recalled that, at the Committee's meeting of 18 June, the Secretary-General of UNCTAD, the Chairman of the General Council, the head of the ITC, and the Director-General of the WTO each had addressed the Members. He furthermore recalled that the Ministerial Declaration on the WTO's contribution to achieving greater coherence in global economic policy-making called for cooperation with international organization responsible for monetary and financial matters.

She also noted the Director-General's untiring efforts to increase the influence of developing countries on issues related to world trade. Increased linkages between trade policy and economic policy required greater coherence in global economic policy making and called for closer cooperation and consultation between these institutions. She referred to the WTO agreements with linkages to IMF programmes, in particular the Agreements on Customs Valuation, Subsidies, Safeguards, Anti-dumping, Trade-Related Investment Measures and the GATS. Her government was in the process of bringing its national legislation into conformity with WTO obligations as well as developing the necessary institutional framework to implement the WTO agreements. She wondered how developing countries could reconcile their obligations under the WTO agreements which called for freer market access with their obligations under IMF/World Bank supported programmes calling for increased revenue collection.","WTCOMTDM10.pdf","Kenya, Chairman, El, Kabbaj, Chairman, IMF/World, Bank, Development, Committee, Director-General, WTO, IMF, Customs, Valuation, WTO, WTO, WTO, IMF/World, Bank"

Mr. El Kabbaj said that he was confident that the Director-General's initiatives on market access and foreign direct investment would be welcomed by the IMF/World Bank Development Committee, even though the international community had yet to come forward with a positive response. He was certain that, in collaboration with the heads of the IMF and of the World Bank, genuine efforts would be forthcoming to give these proposals a concrete content. Cooperation between the institutions had become a necessity, since economic and social development did not come about simply through a one-way transfer of resources but called for a global approach, linking various elements such as trade, investment                                                                                       WT/COMTD/M/10                                                                                       Page 9 and transfer of technology and know-how. He assured the representative of Tanzania that the Development Committee had fully recognized the problems created by a heavy debt-burden particularly on the poorest countries. This was borne out by its latest debt-initiative from which Tanzania would be benefitting: modalities for this initiative should be in place after the forthcoming joint IMF/World Bank meeting. While the Development Committee recognized the problems resulting from inadequate resources, neither the tenth nor the eleventh replenishment of IDA funds had come to a level necessary to cover all programmes. In June of this year, IDA had received pledges for 14.5 billion SDR's over a three-year period, and he was hopeful that a special effort would get underway to restructure and reinforce the economies of least-developed countries and to increase their production capacity. Along with IDA resources, investment flows were important, not only for balance of payment reasons but also because such flow enhanced possibilities to become more integrated in the global economy. The Development Committee straddled both Bretton Woods institutions and counted ministers of both developing and developed countries among its members. Their presence would ensure that decisions were translated into action. Alleviation of poverty was at the heart of the IMF and the World Bank' activities. This had been highlighted in the latest World Bank Report and had prompted the debt-initiative and the initiative to increase resources available to IDA. The programmes supported by the financial institution encouraged the establishment of efficient institutions capable of meeting the challenges of globalization. The apparent conflict referred to by the representative of Kenya was something of real concern; he suggested that countries use the expertise available in the institutions concerned to avoid the conflicts referred to.","WTCOMTDM10.pdf","El, Kabbaj, Director-General, IMF/World, Bank, Development, Committee, IMF, World, Bank, Tanzania, Development, Committee, Tanzania, IMF/World, Bank, Development, Committee, IDA, IDA, Development, Committee, Bretton, Woods, IMF, World, Bank, Kenya"
"50",50,"23","23.      The Director-General thanked the Chairman for his role in revitalizing an essential part of the WTO system. Due to this renewed vitality he was now addressing the Committee on Trade and Development for the third time this year. He also thanked Mr. El Kabbaj for supporting his initiative to establish duty free access for exports of the least-developed countries. He recalled that the G7 had requested that he pursue this proposal and, along with other initiatives for strengthened technical assistance, bring it to the Singapore Ministerial Meeting. In that context, he underlined the importance of support from the Development Committee. Further, he said that trade was an engine of economic growth and as such, in its efforts to achieve the greatest possible degree of trade liberalization, the WTO was contributing to such growth. While he recognized the unequal distribution of wealth and immobility of the poorer sections of society, he noted that this was not the consequence of trade, greater liberalization or of increasing globalization. He did not agree that market opening resulted in the marginalization of developing and least-developed countries. Distribution of wealth needed positive action at the national level and, as referred to by the Chairman, action by other international agencies. While the solutions to these issues fell outside the field of responsibility of the WTO, it was nevertheless a matter of great concern and the WTO was making every effort to improve coordination in this regard with other major international agencies such as the IMF, the World Bank and UNCTAD. The latest report by the UNDP had drawn attention to the fact that the living standards of 3,000 million people had improved beyond levels ever experienced before. But several had become worse off. He said that the problem was one of distribution, and noted that the same report also concluded that the human development index had gone up in most regions over the past three decades. The Director-General re-emphasized that distribution policies, rather than globalization, had led to marginalization. He then noted that progress in information technology was an important element in the globalization process. In this context he said that the WTO and the World Bank were jointly exploring concrete possibilities to cooperate in the area of technical assistance, in particular on modalities to make full use of new technological tools.","WTCOMTDM10.pdf","Director-General, Chairman, WTO, Committee, on, Trade, and, Development, El, Kabbaj, Development, Committee, WTO, Chairman, WTO, WTO, IMF, World, Bank, UNCTAD, UNDP, Director-General, WTO, World, Bank"

"53",53,"26","26.       The representative of Egypt said that she would like to make some comments on the study contained in document WT/COMTD/W/15, in view of its relevance as an input into the preparatory process for Singapore, in terms of the assessment of the implementation of Uruguay Round results and their impact on developing countries, in particular the least-developed, and African countries. While she appreciated the note especially for its scope and wide range of issues it covered, it nevertheless needed careful consideration in view of her delegation' views on its use. Certain conclusions could be called into doubt, due to the highly aggregate level of its analysis, which did not allow for more accurate conclusions. In particular conclusions on the extent of the erosion of preferential margins for African countries, on tariff escalation and on peak tariffs. Furthermore, it was unclear whether the paper referred to simple or weighted tariff averages. The note was factual rather than analytical, focused more on trends without analysing underlying factors and causes. Her delegation had cautioned on a number of occasions against increased marginalization of the more vulnerable developing countries. Some aspects of the results of the Uruguay Round ran the risk of being at the basis of an accelerated marginalization of the vulnerable economies, if not addressed carefully to mitigate their negative effects. For example, as a result of erosion of preferential tariff margins, some of these countries would not be able to compete, hence would loose market share and overall export earnings. As some of these countries were also net importers of foodstuff, higher food prices would swell their import bills. A combination of these factors would worsen their situation dramatically. In addition to further marginalization, they would also run the risk of seeing their economic growth prospects severely affected. These factors should be adequately analysed in the framework of the overall implementation of the Uruguay Round results and submitted to Ministers in Singapore. Turning to more specific parts of the note, she said that the observation that in some instances the countries with a poor export performance had better access to industrial country markets than those countries whose exports expanded rapidly, failed to take into account different levels of development, the rapid growing rates of investment in some countries compared to others, the effective utilization of GSP by the more advanced developing countries, in short did not analyse underlying factors for their weak export performance. She noted a lack of in-depth analysis of the concept of ""other external factors"", as cause for poor economic performance. Such factors should be at the basis of the upcoming coordination with the Bretton woods institutions on global coherence. The CTD should study more in depth the cause and the effect of factors such as fluctuations in world interest rates and exchange rates on volumes and values of developing countries' exports, the impact of commodity prices and the cyclical change in demand in industrialized countries for their exports, and the impact of outstanding debt on their trade performance. She recalled that these were among the issues developing countries had hoped to include in the Marrakesh declaration. She expressed surprise at the fact that some of the more important issues, such as the effects of anti-dumping investigations, were relegated to footnotes rather than being among the main factors analysed; there was also no identification of sectors most affected. The optimistic evaluation of the advantages flowing from the full implementation of the tariff commitments made by developed countries in the Uruguay Round failed to take into account that new non-tariff measures, and new conditionalities on preferences, often practically impaired and nullified Uruguay Round benefits. Although a rise in the level of bindings was a positive outcome, it was misleading to suggest that, once a tariff reduction was fully implemented, benefits were assured for developing country exporters. The security of bound MFN tariffs was not always a compensation for loss in preferential margins. She                                                                                      WT/COMTD/M/10                                                                                      Page 11 would appreciate more analysis of the impact of the Agreement on Agriculture on Non-food importing Countries. Statistical models including one developed by UNCTAD (and used for a joint WTO/UNCTAD study) could be used for such an analysis. She found it surprising that the prerequisites for a more effective integration enumerated in the paper related exclusively to what could be done by developing countries themselves. It failed to mention factors such as new disguised protectionist measures, the necessity to adhere strictly to the implementation of the Agreements and the inadequate implementation of the various provisions stipulating technical and financial assistance. A more comprehensive assessment of the prerequisites for a more effective integration should be taken up, in the light of the replies to the Chairman's request for information on the implementation of provisions in favour of developing countries from the Chairpersons of the relevant Committees and Councils. She thanked the Secretariat for the study and said that her delegation would look into ways how best to prepare for the necessary follow-up and recommendations in this regard for the Ministerial Conference in Singapore.","WTCOMTDM10.pdf","Egypt, Singapore, Uruguay, Uruguay, Uruguay, Singapore, GSP, Bretton, CTD, Marrakesh, Uruguay, Round, Uruguay, MFN, UNCTAD, Chairman, Secretariat, Singapore"

The representative of India drew attention to a previous intervention and specifically recalled his request that a future version of the paper give sufficient prominence to the role of domestic investment. Notwithstanding the clarification that the apparent lack of prominence in the paper given to the relevance of domestic savings ratios resulted from the fact that its importance was a basic assumption and thus self-evident, he was of the view that the report should deal with it adequately in the body of the report, rather than in a footnote. He also said that the paragraph describing the positive interlinkages between foreign direct investment, export performance and other economic factors, was rather unbalanced. The recent UNCTAD report on Trade and Development contained sufficient material to put into question statements in that paragraph and he suggested that the Secretariat reconsider that paragraph in the light of the UNCTAD report.","WTCOMTDM10.pdf","India, UNCTAD, Trade, and, Development, Secretariat, UNCTAD"

"57",57,"3","3.       Mr. El Kabbaj, Chairman of the Joint IMF/World Bank Development Committee, welcomed the opportunity which had been given to him to address the Committee and said that the CTD, under the vigorous efforts of its Chairman, had initiated an active and substantial programme aimed at strengthening the positive impact of the WTO on the developing countries. He would describe the joint IMF/World Bank Development Committee's scope of activity and the way in which it operated; its long-standing interest in trade problems; and its future work. Turning to the Committee's scope of activity, he explained that, in 1974, the Governors of the IMF and the World Bank had created two Ministerial Committees. One was the Interim Committee which, despite its name, was in fact a permanent committee which dealt with international monetary problems, and specifically with matters relating to the International Monetary Fund; the second committee was officially named the Joint Ministerial Committee of the Boards of Governors of the Bank and the Fund on the Transfer of Real Resources to the Developing Countries. For obvious reasons, this Committee tended to be referred to as the Development Committee. Since its terms of reference consisted of examining the question of the transfer of resources to the developing countries, it was appropriate that the Development Committee should be a joint committee of the Bretton Woods institutions. Unlike the Interim Committee, which was specifically linked to the IMF, the Development Committee was a joint committee of the two institutions. It was important to point out however, that it was officially a consultative body of the Boards of Governors of the World Bank and the IMF, and not a decision-making body. However, since the Ministers for Finance and, in certain cases, the Ministers for Development who were members of the Committee, were also the Governors of the World Bank and the IMF, their suggestions carried considerable weight in the political discussions of the two institutions. The Development Committee comprised 24 members as well as 20 observers including, of course, the WTO. Its membership reflected the structure of the Boards of the World Bank and the IMF. This meant that some members represented only one country, while others represented well over 20, depending on their size. The Chairman was chosen by the Committee from among its members. The Committee had an Executive Secretary who coordinated the work of its Secretariat and prepared the conference-room papers. It essentially depended for its documentation on the highly-qualified staff of the Fund and the Bank, and occasionally on studies from other organizations if necessary. The Committee met twice a year, often for a half day. These meetings were traditionally followed by a private lunch organized at the initiative of the Chairman, bringing together the members of the Committee, the member States, the President of the World Bank and the Managing Director of the IMF. The discussions had often been informative and useful, covering a whole range of issues relating to the problems of development. However, it was widely felt that the action of the Committee had not always produced significant and lasting results. Indeed, the Committee had launched a number of important initiatives, for example the creation of an Interest Subsidy Fund at the World Bank in 1974, the Special Assistance Facility for Sub-Saharan Africa in 1985, and more recently, the Environmental Facility. However, for a variety of reasons, including the fact that its role was only consultative and that the Directors and Boards hesitated to entrust it with particularly sensitive matters, the Committee had not really established a reputation for accomplishing what it set out to do. While it was too soon to say that the Committee had clearly taken on a new role, it was certainly moving in that direction. Ever since he had taken over the Chairmanship 18 months ago, he had been convinced that its role had to change. That conviction was shared by Mr. Wolfensohn and Mr. Camdessus. With the support of the other members, they had done their utmost to strengthen the Committee, and concrete results were showing.","WTCOMTDM10.pdf","El, Kabbaj, Chairman, Joint, IMF/World, Bank, Development, Committee, Committee, CTD, Chairman, WTO, IMF/World, Bank, Development, Committee, Committee, IMF, World, Bank, Interim, Committee, International, Monetary, Fund, Joint, Ministerial, Committee, Bank, Committee, Development, Committee, Development, Committee, Bretton, Woods, Interim, Committee, IMF, Development, Committee, World, Bank, IMF, Ministers, for, Development, Committee, World, Bank, IMF, Development, Committee, WTO, World, Bank, IMF, Chairman, Committee, Committee, Secretariat, Bank, Committee, Chairman, Committee, States, World, Bank, Director, IMF, Committee, Committee, World, Bank, Sub-Saharan, Africa, Committee, Committee, Wolfensohn, Camdessus, Committee"

"60",60,"4","4.       Mr. El Kabbaj went on to say that the most important of those concrete results involved the problem of the external debt of the heavily indebted poor countries for whom current mechanisms did not suffice to reduce the burden to a level they could support. Estimates suggested that future progress towards development of some 20 of those countries depended on their external debt being brought back down to a level they could handle. This initiative, which had been discussed in various fora, in particular at the G7 summit, had received considerable support, and he was hopeful that it would be adopted at the next meeting of the Committee. It would concern all of the members of the financial                                                                                        WT/COMTD/M/10                                                                                        Page 3 institutions: creditors, debtors, donors, etc. The Committee also intended to address another central issue next April, namely the prospects for the future replenishment of the resources of the International Development Association (IDA), which was the central body dealing with international aid to the poorest of the developing countries. He recalled that the replenishment of the IDA's resources was directly linked to the broader issue of the prospects for all forms of concessional aid required to help the poor countries become active participants in the global economy. The transfer of resources was the main purpose underlying the creation of the Development Committee 22 years ago, and its founders no doubt had the increase of the flows of official development assistance in mind. He noted that, with the increasing inter-dependence of the international economy and the growing diversity among the developing countries over the past few years, the Committee had grown conscious of the importance of addressing issues such as private funding, investment, trade, and the soundness of multilateral development institutions, and last year, in particular, it had examined the question of coordination between the different financial aid institutions and the regional banks. In this connection, the Committee had developed or studied a new way of coordinating those different institutions and had drawn up a report commonly known as the Task Force report on the coordination of all regional bank institutions, the World Bank and all of the finance institutions.","WTCOMTDM10.pdf","El, Kabbaj, Committee, Committee, International, Development, Association, IDA, Development, Committee, Committee, Committee, World, Bank"
"61",61,"5","5.       Mr. El Kabbaj pointed out that efforts were also made to enhance the efficiency of the Development Committee by revising the way in which it operated. The traditional approach of the Development Committee consisted of holding a long plenary meeting during which the 24 Ministers and five or six observers would make statements which took up the morning. This left little time for the Ministers to consider the basic problems in any depth, and indeed, some Ministers preferred simply to make their statements and leave the meeting. In agreement with Mr. Wolfensohn and Mr. Camdessus, the Committee had taken the initiative of proposing that the statements should be dropped, which the Ministers unanimously adopted. He was now responsible for summarizing before the Committee all of the contributions by the Ministers in one statement to the plenary. As a result, the Committee now spent most of the time available on the fundamental problems in restricted meetings of the 24 Ministers. The discussions would then be summarized in a short communiqué reflecting the Committee's consensus. The luncheon was now devoted more specifically to subjects relating to the general strategic orientations of the World Bank itself. He had been pleased to see that this progress was highlighted at the last G7 summit, in Lyon, which issued a communiqué stating that ""the reform of the Development Committee had made it possible for Ministers from developed and the developing countries to consider issues together and provide guidance to the institutions"". The Committee expected to work along the lines described in the communiqué. There was still a long way to go, but some encouraging progress had been made and efforts were being pursued to turn the Committee into a true forum for political decision- makers throughout the world.","WTCOMTDM10.pdf","El, Kabbaj, Development, Committee, Development, Committee, Wolfensohn, Camdessus, Committee, Committee, Committee, Committee, World, Bank, Lyon, Development, Committee, Committee, Committee"
"62",62,"6","6.      Turning to the trade aspects of the Development Committee, Mr. El Kabbaj said that, with the increasing interdependence of global economies, the links between trade and development had acquired great importance within the Development Committee in the middle of the 1980s. The Committee had first addressed the issue in 1983, and had recognized that free market access for developing country exports was an essential element of support in their adjustment efforts in connection with their search for a long-term solution to the debt problem. The Committee had also welcomed GATT's efforts to liberalize and reinforce the international trade system, including the promotion of a new round of negotiations in which both the developed and the developing countries could participate actively together. At the start of the Uruguay Round, the Ministers for finance considered that it was important for them to follow the development of the negotiations closely. Thus, the Committee had become a forum to focus its attention on the importance of the trade aspects. He recalled that some Ministers for finance, including several from the developing countries, had not always been involved in these aspects, in spite of the significant impact of trade policy on the generation of resources for development. During the Uruguay Round, the Director-General of GATT had reported to the Committee WT/COMTD/M/10 Page 4 every six months on the progress of the negotiations. The Ministers had repeatedly expressed their hope that the Uruguay Round would be completed rapidly and achieve positive results. On several occasions, moreover, trade aspects had headed the Committee's agenda. On the basis of studies by the Bank and the Fund and the opinions of the GATT Council, the Ministers had examined the implications of the regional trade agreements, the impact of industrial, trade and agricultural policies on development, and the need for the World Bank and the IMF to join GATT in supporting the developing countries in their efforts to liberalize trade. The potential impact of the conclusions of the Uruguay Round on the developing countries and other trade-related matters had also been considered. Over the past few years, many developing countries had become much more aware of the potential benefits of trade liberalization. At the same time, several industrialized countries had shown a greater understanding of the problems experienced by the developing countries in integrating into the global economy. In that respect the Development Committee had played a useful role in harmonizing the different viewpoints. The Committee had welcomed the Marrakesh Agreements in 1994, and given considerable attention to encouraging the effective implementation of the conclusions of the Uruguay Round. At the same time, he, as its Chairman, had strongly recommended increased liberalization of the agricultural and service sectors in order to ensure tangible benefits for the developing countries, and had requested the Bank and the Fund to assist the developing countries, including the transition economies, to accede to the WTO. The Committee had welcomed the establishment of the new Organization and had encouraged close cooperation between the WTO and the Bretton Woods institutions.","WTCOMTDM10.pdf","Development, Committee, El, Kabbaj, Development, Committee, Committee, Committee, GATT, Uruguay, Round, Committee, Uruguay, Round, Director-General, GATT, Committee, Uruguay, Round, Committee, Bank, GATT, Council, World, Bank, IMF, GATT, Uruguay, Round, Development, Committee, Committee, Uruguay, Round, Chairman, Bank, WTO, Committee, WTO"
"63",63,"7","7.        Mr. El Kabbaj noted that, thus, over the past decade the members of the Development Committee and the Bretton Woods institutions had given special attention to the convergence of the work of the GATT/WTO and of the two international financial institutions. This convergence had become more and more necessary in view of the increasing globalization of markets and the interdependence of the commercial and financial spheres in international trade. The trend towards globalization and liberalization of trade posed two major types of challenge. First, the events of 1994, in particular the Mexican crisis - the significant fluctuations in exchange rates between the principal currencies and the repercussions of those fluctuations on other currencies - had underscored the increasingly decisive influence of the globalization of financial markets on the world economy as a whole, and the risk that if their disciplines were ignored, they might shed doubt on the stabilization and liberalization programmes of the developing countries in particular. This had led him to conclude that globalization had to be coupled with a strengthening of multilateral disciplines with respect to both trade and financing, and that those disciplines should serve to maintain an international environment which was permanently both stable and secure. The trade policy review mechanism had to be accompanied by a similar mechanism in the financial area. Second, globalization of the economy called for increased dialogue between the different multilateral institutions and an effort towards international solidarity if it was to contribute to the integration of the developing countries into the global economy rather than to their exclusion. These were the principal challenges facing the international community in its effort to ensure that globalization and the increasing interdependence of trade and finance would develop into an irreversible process benefiting everyone. A quote from the speech of His Majesty King Hassan II at the closing ceremony of the Ministerial Meeting of the Uruguay Round, held in Marrakesh in April 1994, provided a perfect illustration of these challenges: ""This globalization could lead to greater inequalities between countries and aggravate the symptoms of social exclusion that are just as prevalent in the affluent countries as in the less-affluent countries. In other words, it calls for the creation and implementation of new collective solidarity mechanisms and demands a new approach to the problems of economic and social development. The reason why a good number of developing countries boldly restructure their economies in order to integrate them more easily into the international economy is that they are convinced of the virtues of financial austerity and of the need to limit the social cost which they will temporarily have to support. The developed countries must offset this cost with symmetric adjustments designed to favour market access and transparency in the conditions of fair competition, in particular through greater monetary stability.""

"64",64,"8","8.        Turning to the outlook and relations between the Development Committee and the WTO, Mr. El Kabbaj said that he had been impressed throughout his chairmanship by the frequent contacts between representatives of the WTO, the IMF and the World Bank. Their regular meetings and the support of the United Nations Secretary-General were important in strengthening cooperation among those key bodies. He was looking forward to hearing WTO's Director-General address the Development Committee in the context of that cooperation. Indeed, Mr. Ruggiero had been invited to hold discussions with the Ministers on the issues - and particularly those concerning the developing countries - which were likely to be discussed during the first WTO Ministerial Conference in Singapore next December. He acknowledged that the agenda of that important meeting had not yet been precisely defined, and that WTO's Committee on Trade and Development had an important role in its preparation. Ministers members of the Development Committee were eager to learn more about the progress made since the conclusion of the Uruguay Round and developments in other fields in which a more active follow-up was required and where much remained to be done. He was also aware that the WTO, the Bank and the Fund were working together on the development of cooperation agreements. He was hopeful that the rapid and successful conclusion of these agreements would further strengthen the constructive cooperation that was already operating at several levels between the WTO and the Bretton Woods institutions, in keeping with their respective mandates. These institutions had complementary functions, and had all contributed since their creation to the development and maintenance of an open international trade system. The agenda of the Development Committee would continue to develop. Though he was not in a position to tell delegations what that agenda would contain beyond next April, he assured them that the IMF/World Bank Development Committee would continue to examine issues which were truly meaningful and had significant implications for the member countries. In any case, he was hopeful that the issues directly linked to trade would appear on the Committee's future agenda and that wherever they did, the WTO would participate actively in the IMF/World Bank Development Committee's discussions.","WTCOMTDM10.pdf","Development, Committee, WTO, El, Kabbaj, WTO, IMF, World, Bank, United, Nations, WTO, Director-General, Development, Committee, Ruggiero, WTO, Ministerial, Conference, Singapore, WTO, Committee, on, Trade, and, Development, Development, Committee, Uruguay, Round, WTO, Bank, WTO, Development, Committee, IMF/World, Bank, Development, Committee, Committee, WTO, IMF/World, Bank, Development, Committee"

As far as his delegation was aware, these Acts did not make reference to LDCs. Accordingly, he did not believe that there was a justification to include the references to these Acts in the Secretariat report. He therefore suggested deleting footnote c of Table 1, and also deleting the last two sentences of paragraph 4.5. He additionally suggested a modification to the first sentence of paragraph 4.5, so that it would read: ""It may be noted that a few Members maintain multiple non-reciprocal market access schemes for certain groups of developing countries, which are also benefitting some LDCs belonging to those groups.""","WTCOMTDM100.pdf","Bangladesh, Secretariat, AGOA, Secretariat, Members"

These concerns had been raised at the informal, open-ended CTD meeting on 15 November. She noted firstly that Table 1 of the report compared DFQF access under the GSP schemes of developed Members. The US had been cited as providing 82.6% DFQF coverage. However, the table failed to include the duty-free access provided to LDCs under two additional programmes, which were AGOA and CBTPA. Although paragraph 4.5 of the report mentioned these two programmes, the table did not include the data from these programmes. From the perspective of her delegation, the reference to these programmes in paragraph 4.5 was a compromise. In this light, her delegation could not agree to the proposed changes to the paragraph that had been suggested by Bangladesh. She also expressed appreciation for the insertion of footnote c in Table 1, which clarified that the US provided 97.6% DFQF coverage under AGOA. She indicated that her delegation could not agree to the proposal by Bangladesh to delete this footnote, and that the report as it stood took into account the concerns expressed by her delegation at the informal, open-ended meeting on 15 November. She went on to say that, while her delegation appreciated that the objective of Table 1 was to provide information on Members' GSP schemes, this approach did not provide the full picture, since all preference programmes that benefited LDCs were not mentioned. Nevertheless, her delegation was willing to join a consensus to approve the report as contained in document WT/COMTD/W/222. She also informed the Committee that officials from her capital had been in contact with the Secretariat to understand what data was missing. Her delegation would continue to work with the Secretariat and other Members in order to identify ways to provide a more comprehensive picture in the future of Members’ preference programmes.","WTCOMTDM100.pdf","United, States, Secretariat, CTD, GSP, Members, US, AGOA, Bangladesh, US, AGOA, Bangladesh, Members, LDCs, Committee, Secretariat, Secretariat, Members, Members"

He noted that some developing Members implementing DFQF schemes had as yet not notified their schemes under the Transparency Mechanism for PTAs, and encouraged them to submit the required notifications. Other developing Members in a position to do so were also invited to consider granting DFQF market access to LDCs. Noting that preferential market access was not sufficient to achieve the objectives set out in the Hong Kong DFQF Decision, he invited Members to also respond to the Bali and Nairobi Decisions concerning preferential rules of origin for LDCs. In closing, he noted that the LDC Group was requesting that a clinical examination be undertaken of DFQF implementation. This was the subject of the following sub-item.

In this regard, he suggested that it would be useful if the LDC Group could identify a list of products of particular export interest, at the 6-digit level of                                          WT/COMTD/M/100                                                 - 18 - the Harmonized System. The Secretariat could then examine the extent to which these products were included in Members' DFQF schemes. This would give an idea of whether DFQF market access was being provided on items of export interest to LDCs.","WTCOMTDM100.pdf","Australia, Benin, LDC, Group, Secretariat, Members"

"85",85,"112","112. The representative of the United States said that she was not aware of whether there was a mention of LDCs in AGOA and CBTPA. However, she noted that the two preference programmes were benefiting some LDCs, and this needed to be captured in some way in the Secretariat report. Her delegation believed that the Secretariat report as it stood represented a sufficient compromise to capture what these programmes were providing to certain LDCs.","WTCOMTDM100.pdf","United, States, AGOA, Secretariat, Secretariat"

"87",87,"114","114. The Chairman recalled that the original version of the proposal by the LDC Group for a clinical examination of DFQF implementation had been considered at the 99 th Session. Some comments were made on the proposal, and the delegation of Benin had indicated that the LDC Group would hold discussions with the Members that made comments. A revised submission, contained in document WT/COMTD/W/218/Rev.1, had now been circulated. He invited Benin to introduce the revised submission.","WTCOMTDM100.pdf","Chairman, LDC, Group, Benin, LDC, Group, Members, Benin"
"88",88,"115","115. The representative of Benin, on behalf of the LDC Group emphasized the importance of DFQF market access, and noted that it had been recognized by the international community as a key issue for LDCs. He recalled some of the comments that had been made on the LDC Group's proposal at the 99th Session, and informed the Committee that the revised proposal had been formulated on the basis of consultations with a number of delegations. Referring to the four sections in the submission, he went on to explain the elements of the revised proposal. With regard to the first section, which contained the background to the proposal, he noted that one Member had indicated during the consultations that a reference to the Hong Kong DFQF Decision was prejudicial to its position on the DDA, and had suggested that the reference could be omitted. However, the LDC Group had decided that it was not necessary to make any changes to the first section, since this section recalled the legal basis for the clinical examination. He stressed that the reference to the Hong Kong Decision had no bearing on the ongoing discussions regarding the DDA.","WTCOMTDM100.pdf","Benin, LDC, Group, LDC, Group, Committee, Member, Hong, Kong, DDA, LDC, Group, Hong, Kong, DDA"
"89",89,"116","116. Turning to the second section of the proposal, which addressed the scope and parameters of the clinical examination, he said that one Member had felt targeted by parameters 9, 10 and 11 in the original proposal, and had suggested that they needed to be made more general. After several consultations, the LDC Group had decided to make the parameters neutral, and to also drop parameter 10. He additionally informed the Committee that no observations had been made on the third section of the proposal, concerning the approach, while the timetable for the study, contained in the fourth section, had been rearranged. He went on to say that the LDC Group had demonstrated flexibility, and urged Members to show similar flexibility. It was observed in this regard that the Group was asking for a study, and not a decision. The objective of the proposed clinical examination was for an impartial and objective diagnosis to be prepared, on the basis of statistical data. This would ultimately contribute to the formulation of recommendations aimed at improving market access for LDCs, with a view to strengthening their export capacity and generating diversification and structural transformation. He stressed the importance of working towards concrete and practical follow-ups to Ministerial Decisions, and called on Members to agree to the terms of reference for the clinical examination, with a view to ensuring the effective implementation of the Hong Kong Decision. Finally, he welcomed the suggestion by Australia under the previous sub-item, and indicated that the proposed study should incorporate the suggested work.

"90",90,"117","117. The representative of Pakistan said that the proposal was a right step towards the implementation of the Hong Kong DFQF Decision and subsequent Ministerial Decisions. He also emphasized the need to ensure that the exports of other developing countries at similar levels of development as LDCs would not be negatively impacted.","WTCOMTDM100.pdf","Pakistan, Hong, Kong"
"91",91,"118","118. The representative of India said that paragraph 47 of the Hong Kong Ministerial Declaration placed an obligation on developed Members to provide DFQF market access for products originating from LDCs, while it encouraged developing Members declaring themselves in a position to do so, to provide such treatment to LDCs' products. India was the first developing Member to announce a comprehensive scheme to provide DFQF market access to LDCs. India's scheme now provided DFQF market access on 96% of tariff lines at the 6-digit level of the Harmonized System, while an additional 2.2% of lines enjoyed preferential duties. Only 1.8% of tariff lines had been retained in the exclusion list, with no tariff concessions. Turning to the proposal under the consideration, he observed that it quoted only some parts of the Hong Kong DFQF Decision, and in particular omitted those parts which emphasized the differences in obligations between developed and developing Members. He explained in this regard that, according to the Hong Kong Decision, developed Members were obliged to provide DFQF market access on at least 97% of tariff lines, while this was voluntary on the part of developing Members. Furthermore, developing Members were permitted to phase in their commitments, and also enjoyed appropriate flexibility in coverage. He believed that quoting only selectively from the Hong Kong Decision would send a wrong message that the DFQF obligations of developed and developing Members were the same. He also noted that, in the Bali DFQF Decision, a reference to the 97% coverage was only made in the paragraph concerning developed Members. In conclusion, he indicated that, while India supported the proposed study by the Secretariat, the differences in obligations between developed and developing Members granting DFQF market access needed to be reflected in the terms of reference, and in the study itself.","WTCOMTDM100.pdf","India, Hong, Kong, Members, Members, India, Member, India, Hong, Kong, Members, Hong, Kong, Decision, Members, Members, Members, Hong, Kong, Decision, Members, Bali, Members, India, Secretariat, Members"
"92",92,"119","119. The representative of Uganda supported the intervention by Benin. He indicated that his intervention was with respect to both sub-items under the present agenda item. Turning firstly to the Secretariat report on Members' DFQF market access for LDCs, he expressed appreciation to the Members that had responded to the Hong Kong Decision by providing DFQF market access to LDCs, including those that had already attained the 97% threshold. He noted that it was important for preference-granting countries to effectively implement the notification requirements, and make available the utilization rates in their DFQF schemes. He also expressed appreciation to the Members that were responding to the Nairobi Ministerial Decision on preferential rules of origin for LDCs. With respect to the revised proposal by the LDC Group for a clinical examination of DFQF implementation, he explained that it had not been possible to accommodate all the requests that had been made by delegations during the consultations. In particular, the Group had decided to maintain the reference to the Hong Kong Decision, as it was felt that this Decision provided the appropriate background and mandate. Furthermore, it had systemic implications for all LDC-specific issues, including cotton, preferential rules of origin and the services waiver. He questioned the suggestion that no references could be made to the DDA, noting in particular that this had further implications, for example with respect to the implementation of the Ministerial Decisions from the Bali and Nairobi Ministerial Conferences. He also observed that the proposed clinical examination was not about the future, but rather about how DFQF had been implemented in the past. Any recommendations resulting from the study would have to be agreed to by consensus in the CTD. Finally, he indicated that his delegation had taken note of the interventions by Australia and India, and looked forward to engaging.","WTCOMTDM100.pdf","Uganda, Benin, Secretariat, Members, LDCs, Members, Hong, Kong, Members, Nairobi, LDCs, LDC, Group, Group, Hong, Kong, DDA, Bali, Nairobi, Ministerial, Conferences, DFQF, CTD, Australia, India"

The representative of China said that his delegation attached great importance to the implementation of DFQF market access for LDCs, and had been providing 97% DFQF access since 2015. However, he also emphasized that it was necessary to acknowledge essential differences in the responsibilities of developed and developing Members in this regard. For developed Members, DFQF was an obligation. Developing Members provided DFQF market access on a voluntary basis, and faced more challenges in their own development process than developed Members. He called on developed Members to fully implement their obligations, and suggested that the clinical examination needed to be more focused on DFQF implementation by developed Members.","WTCOMTDM100.pdf","China, Members, Members, Members, Members, Members, Members"
"95",95,"121","121. The representative of Chinese Taipei said that DFQF market access was an important tool to help LDCs integrate into the multilateral trading system. While recalling that Chinese Taipei had already notified its DFQF scheme, she also noted that, according to the Hong Kong Decision, developed Members and developing Members had different DFQF responsibilities. For developing                                         WT/COMTD/M/100                                                - 20 - Members, the provision of DFQF market access was voluntary.

"96",96,"122","122. The representative of the United States said that her delegation had previously informed the Committee of the actions the US had taken to implement the Bali DFQF Decision. She also recalled that her delegation had raised concerns at the 99th Session on the original proposal by the LDC Group. Although the US was still analysing the revised proposal, she said that she wished to reiterate some of these concerns, as they had not been addressed in the revision. First, her delegation believed that the Secretariat study needed to be fact-based. However, the revised proposal continued to raise subjective questions which could not be answered at a general level, and with respect to which it was not appropriate for the Secretariat to make judgements. As examples, she noted that the proposed terms of reference sought to determine why there had been a problem in DFQF implementation, and why textiles and garments in particular had been a problem in this respect. She also indicated that much of the information called for in the proposed terms of reference was already available elsewhere. For example, in line with the Bali DFQF Decision, the Secretariat produced a report on DFQF market access at the tariff line level. Furthermore, the CTD's Dedicated Session on Small Economies had examined the textile and apparel sector in detail, and the documents produced in that context addressed the data requests in the proposal. Similarly, other data called for in the proposal were already publicly available, or generated by the LDCs themselves. She next pointed to parameter 9 in the submission, and noted that tariff preferences were not always the primary determinant of sourcing decisions. Other factors – such as product availability, production time, and vendor reliability – also played a role. She informed the Committee that her delegation was not in a position to support the proposed terms of reference for the Secretariat study at the present time.","WTCOMTDM100.pdf","United, States, Committee, US, Bali, LDC, Group, US, Secretariat, Secretariat, Bali, Secretariat, CTD, LDCs, Committee, Secretariat"

In this regard, she noted that the revised submission continued to include some subjective elements. She also emphasized that the content of the proposed study should not duplicate information that was already available in existing Secretariat documents. Finally, she indicated that she would need to consider further the suggestion from some delegations that the analysis in the clinical examination should be different for developing Members relative to developed Members.","WTCOMTDM100.pdf","Canada, Secretariat, Secretariat, Members, Members"

The Chairman recalled that, at the Eighth Ministerial Conference (MC8), Ministers had, inter alia, reaffirmed the positive link between trade and development and called for focused work in the CTD. Ministers had called on Members to fully operationalize the mandate of the CTD as a focal point for development work. He recalled that, at the 97th Session, the Committee had agreed to the proposal from Ecuador contained in document WT/COMTD/W/204/Rev.1, which had been submitted in the context of the CTD's mandate from MC8. The proposal was for the Secretariat to periodically update its paper on the implementation of special and differential treatment (S&D) provisions in the WTO Agreements and Decisions. He informed the Committee that the updated Secretariat document had been circulated in September 2016 in document WT/COMTD/W/219, and indicated that he wished to remind Members of some elements of the proposal from Ecuador that had been agreed to.

Turning to the two proposals for work under the MC8 mandate that were to be considered at the present meeting, he observed that the submissions containing these proposals had been appearing on the CTD’s agenda for quite some time. Previous CTD Chairpersons had held informal consultations to try to make progress on the proposals. He noted in this regard that he had also met informally with the proponents of the two proposals on 1 November 2016, and had convened an informal, open-ended CTD meeting on 15 November. At these informal meetings, he had shared his view that engagement among Members would be necessary in order for progress to be made on the proposals.

Rather, the aim was to fulfil the instructions of Ministers at MC8 to fully operationalize the mandate of the CTD. Recalling that the CTD had been established to serve as a focal point for the consideration and coordination of development-related work in the WTO, she noted that the current reporting structure between WTO bodies fell short of appropriately fulfilling the CTD's overarching mandate.

She went on to provide some examples of the type of information that could be provided to the CTD, including with respect to S&D, the development impact of the elimination of trade-related investment measures, the development impact of the operationalization of the LDC services waiver, information relating to the implementation of Articles 66.1 and 66.2 of the TRIPS Agreement, and information relating to the work of negotiating bodies such as the Negotiating Group on Market Access and the Special Session of the Committee on Agriculture. The Secretariat could then put the various reports together into a single document, which would be discussed in the Committee. The CTD would also be able to provide guidance and appropriate recommendations to the General Council and other WTO bodies on any development-related work. This would better link development to trade in a manner that would contribute to the economic development of the WTO’s developing, least developed, and small and vulnerable constituencies. The compilation document would additionally help to address the capacity constraints of many delegations that were not able to participate in all the meetings of WTO bodies. In closing, she emphasized once again the importance of improving intra-reporting procedures and operationalizing the CTD’s mandate by periodically reviewing the development-related work taking place in other WTO bodies.

Among his other points, he noted that the Monitoring Mechanism on S&D could only be operationalized after steps had been taken to strengthen S&D provisions. Finally, he requested that the two sub-items under the present agenda item remain on the CTD's agenda until the matter was resolved.","WTCOMTDM100.pdf","Benin, LDC, Group, Group, Group, WTO, Nairobi, LDC, Group, CTD, WTO, Members, Chairman, CTD"

The first proposal, which was for the Secretariat to prepare an update to its paper on the implementation of S&D provisions in the WTO Agreements and Decisions, had been agreed to by the Committee at its 87 th Session. The updated Secretariat paper was circulated in June 2013 and had appeared on the CTD's agenda for a number of meetings. As for the second proposal, which was for the CTD to report on development work in the WTO, this idea was now being dealt with in the proposal contained in document WT/COMTD/W/208 which had been addressed under the previous sub-item.

The Chairman said that he wished to provide Members with a brief update on the regional trade agreements (RTAs) notified under the Enabling Clause that were to be considered in the CTD's Dedicated Sessions on RTAs. He firstly informed the Committee that the factual presentation on the agreement between the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) and India would be circulated shortly. With regard to the South Asian Free Trade Agreement (SAFTA), he said that Afghanistan’s accession to SAFTA was notified on 29 July 2016 in document WT/COMTD/N/50. The parties had been requested to provide the data for the preparation of the factual presentation by 22 December 2016. Turning to the Agreement between the Dominican Republic and Panama, he said that the Secretariat would be in contact with the parties concerning some clarifications on the data provided. As for the Arab Mediterranean Free Trade Agreement – or Agadir Agreement – between Egypt, Jordan, Morocco and Tunisia, data had been received from Egypt, Jordan and Morocco. The Secretariat was still waiting to receive data from Tunisia, which was requested by 15 July 2016. With regard to the Agreement between the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) and Singapore, data had been received from Singapore. The Secretariat was still waiting to receive data from the GCC parties, which was requested by 23 November 2015.

He went on to say that there remained one RTA notified under the Enabling Clause that had not been ratified by all the parties. This was the Pacific Island Countries Trade Agreement (PICTA). Following the procedures of the Committee on Regional Trade Agreements (CRTA), a factual presentation of an RTA falling in this category would only be drafted after the agreement had been ratified by all the parties.

"144",144,"44","44.    The representative of India indicated that his intervention related to the three sub-items under the present agenda item, since the three RTAs referenced in these sub-items had been ""dually notified"" under both the Enabling Clause and GATT Article XXIV. He noted that the systemic concerns that were raised by China, Egypt and India over the legal and procedural implications of the dual notification of the GCC Customs Union under both the Enabling Clause and GATT Article XXIV were pertinent even now, but they remained unaddressed. Some Members had expressed the view that the systemic concerns raised in document WT/COMTD/W/175 were outside the scope of the CTD, and needed to be discussed in the Negotiating Group on Rules (NGR). The view of his delegation was that the CTD was the appropriate forum to consider the questions arising from RTAs with a dual notification. Pointing to the terms of reference of the CTD contained in document WT/L/46, he noted that the CTD was designated to serve as a focal point for consideration and coordination of work on development in the WTO and its relationship to development-related activities in other multilateral agencies. He added that the Committee could consult with other WTO bodies in addressing the systemic concerns raised in document WT/COMTD/W/175. This was in keeping with paragraph 3 of the CTD's terms of reference which entrusted the Committee to review periodically, in consultation as appropriate with the relevant bodies of the WTO, the application of special provisions in the Multilateral Trade Agreements and related Ministerial Decisions in favour of developing country Members, and in particular LDC Members, and report to the General Council for appropriate action. In concluding, he indicated that the three sub-items under the present agenda item needed to remain on the CTD's agenda until the systemic and specific concerns arising from ""dually notified"" RTAs were addressed.","WTCOMTDM100.pdf","GATT, China, Egypt, India, GCC, Customs, Union, GATT, Members, CTD, CTD, CTD, CTD, WTO, Committee, WTO, CTD, Committee, WTO, Members, Members, General, Council, CTD"
"145",145,"45","45.    The representative of Egypt said that systemic concerns had been raised by some Members, including Egypt, over the legal and procedural implications of the dual notification of the GCC Customs Union under both the Enabling Clause and GATT Article XXIV. He noted that a number of delegations had previously expressed the view that the Enabling Clause did not provide the appropriate legal basis to justify the formation of a customs union involving the reduction or elimination of NTMs. However, others had argued that the non-prescription of criteria or conditions for the elimination of NTMs did not exclude customs unions among developing countries from the coverage of the Enabling Clause. The view of his delegation was that the CTD was the appropriate forum to consider the questions arising from RTAs with a dual notification. This originated from the CTD's terms of reference, which stipulated that the CTD was the focal point for the consideration and coordination of work on development in the WTO. In addition, paragraph 4 of the terms of reference mandated the CTD to consider any questions with regard to either the application or the use of special provisions in the Multilateral Trade Agreements and related Ministerial Decisions in favour of developing country Members, which included questions relating to the invocation of the Enabling Clause to notify customs unions among developing countries. He hoped that Members could have a substantive discussion on the systemic concerns that had been raised. The present sub-item needed to be maintained on the CTD's agenda until a solution was found.2","WTCOMTDM100.pdf","Egypt, Members, Egypt, GCC, Customs, Union, GATT, CTD, CTD, CTD, WTO, CTD, Members, Members, CTD"
"146",146,"46","46.   The representative of the United States, said that the GCC Customs Union had been notified under GATT Article XXIV, and was in the pipeline to be reviewed in the CRTA. The GCC Customs Union issue was therefore not an issue of dual notification. In this light, he suggested that the proponents of document WT/COMTD/W/175 needed to reconsider the content of their communication by looking at the factual correctness of the GCC Customs Union issue, and subsequently submit another communication if they still had concerns. His delegation was willing to work with Members to find a way to resolve the matter. With regard to the ASEAN-Korea and India-Korea agreements, which were listed as the second and third sub-items under the present agenda item, he did not understand why the proponents insisted on maintaining them on the        2          The points in this paragraph, made by Egypt at the 90th Session and also reflected in the minutes of the 92nd, 93rd, 95th and 97th Sessions, are reflected once again in the minutes of this meeting at the request of the Egyptian delegation.

It was this second document that was to be considered at the present meeting. He informed the Committee that he had convened a small group informal consultation with the LAIA member countries and some other Members on 1 November 2016, in order to provide an opportunity for a preliminary discussion on the new communication. His feeling from that meeting was that more discussions among Members would be required in order to find a way forward on the issues relating to the LAIA agreements.

She, inter alia, reaffirmed the content of the previous communication from LAIA circulated in document WT/COMTD/W/217, and emphasized that each of the LAIA member countries acted in an individual capacity with regard to the agreements they concluded under the 1980 Treaty of Montevideo (TM80). This was clear from the Individual Notification of Agreement Data Sheets annexed to the document ""Report to the WTO on Instruments Concluded Under the 1980 Treaty of Montevideo"". She confirmed that it was the LAIA member countries – and not the General Secretariat, or the LAIA itself – which drafted, approved and submitted to the WTO the Individual Notification of Agreement Data Sheets. These Data Sheets conformed to the notification format for RTAs contained in document WT/REG/16 of 23 November 2006. The LAIA member countries were ready to supplement the information contained in the various Individual Data Sheets in a Dedicated Session of the CTD, in accordance with paragraphs 16 and 18 of the Transparency Mechanism for RTAs.

Referring to the list of RTAs that had appeared in factual presentations and had not yet been notified to the WTO, she indicated that the LAIA member countries wished to know the criteria for determining whether an RTA had not been notified. They also wished to know why, despite the provisions of paragraph 18 of the RTA Transparency Mechanism, this list was circulated for consideration in the CRTA instead of the CTD. In addition, they repeated their call for the WTO Secretariat to remove from this list all agreements between LAIA member countries that were duly notified under paragraph 4(a) of the Enabling Clause. Furthermore, the LAIA member countries once again requested that the WTO Secretariat circulate the documents with the title ""Report to the WTO on Instruments Concluded Under the 1980 Treaty of Montevideo"" with the document symbol “WT/COMTD/N/--"", in keeping with notifications made within the CTD framework.

"158",158,"57","57.    The representative of the United States indicated his delegation’s appreciation for the informal consultation that had been convened by the Chairman. He noted that a similar conversation was taking place in the CRTA. While the US preferred that work on RTAs be consolidated in one Committee, it nevertheless remained open to discussions in the CTD on the non-notified LAIA agreements. He called on delegations to coordinate their work, so as to avoid a repetition and duplication of the discussions in the CRTA, which were more advanced than the discussions in the CTD. Turning to the content of the communication under consideration, he firstly welcomed the assertion by the LAIA member countries that they acted independently with respect to how notification obligations were met. He stressed the importance of individual WTO Members taking the necessary steps to fulfil their obligations, and not seeking to collectively avoid these responsibilities through any process of joint notifications. Second, he reaffirmed his delegation’s position that, while the annual reports from the LAIA Secretariat contained some useful information, they did not constitute a notification to the WTO under GATT Article XXIV, GATS Article V or the Enabling Clause. The US could not support the LAIA member countries' assertion that the information contained in the LAIA reports satisfied the notification requirements under Section D of the RTA Transparency Mechanism. With regard to the question raised in the LAIA communication regarding the criteria for determining non-notified RTAs, he believed that the criteria were clear. He explained in this regard that, for those agreements appearing in the most recent list of non-notified RTAs, contained in document WT/REG/W/111, there had been no notifications received from individual parties to RTAs – either under Section B or Section D of the RTA Transparency Mechanism. As the annual reports from LAIA were not notifications by the individual parties to the agreements, his delegation could not agree with the request for the WTO Secretariat to circulate the LAIA reports with the symbol ""WT/COMTD/N/ --"".","WTCOMTDM100.pdf","United, States, Chairman, CRTA, US, Committee, CTD, CRTA, CTD, LAIA, WTO, Members, LAIA, Secretariat, WTO, GATT, US, LAIA, LAIA, LAIA, WTO, Secretariat, LAIA"

He added that his delegation could not support the request to remove the LAIA agreements from the list of non-notified RTAs, and recalled that there had been no consensus to do so when the issue was discussed in the CRTA on 7 November 2016. He also questioned why the communication under consideration had been addressed to the CTD – and not to the CRTA, which was the Committee in which the list was circulated. He believed that it was inappropriate to make such a request in a communication to the CTD, as the CTD could not take decisions regarding what another Committee – or the Secretariat staff assigned to another Committee – might do. However, there were several options for the LAIA member countries to reduce the number of non-notified RTAs on the list. On the basis of discussions that had taken place, he indicated that many Members would welcome a case-by-case examination of specific LAIA agreements on the list, based on the substance of these agreements. Responses to the EU's written questions circulated in the CRTA would facilitate a productive discussion in this regard, and would help Members to reach consensus on how the agreements related to obligations under Section B or Section D of the RTA Transparency Mechanism. If LAIA member countries wanted their agreements to be removed from the list of non-notified RTAs, he believed that this would be the most productive way forward.","WTCOMTDM100.pdf","LAIA, CRTA, CTD, CRTA, Committee, CTD, CTD, Committee, Secretariat, Committee, LAIA, Members, EU, CRTA, Members, LAIA"

The representative of the United States, in response to the intervention by Panama, recalled that his delegation had welcomed the steps taken by the LAIA member countries to clarify that they acted in an individual capacity with regard to how notification obligations were met. He emphasized the importance of each individual Member taking the steps to determine whether its agreements qualified under GATT Article XXIV, GATS Article V or the Enabling Clause, as no Member should decide for another Member which legal cover to use with respect to a violation of the most-favoured-nation (MFN) principle. In this regard, he believed that the LAIA member countries needed to give further thought on what was a joint notification relative to a notification by individual Members.","WTCOMTDM100.pdf","United, States, Panama, LAIA, Member, GATT, Member, Member, MFN, LAIA, Members"

For her delegation, the priority task was to continue discussions under the Doha Development Agenda (DDA), according to the existing mandate. In the meantime, against the background of weak economic recovery and sluggish global trade growth, discussions in the WTO on e-commerce were also important. She indicated that such discussions should have the aim to help developing Members to use e-commerce, and to provide more opportunities for their SMEs to participate in international trade and global value chains (GVCs).","WTCOMTDM100.pdf","China, Members, Doha, Development, Agenda, DDA, WTO, Members"
"178",178,"75","75.    Turning to the communication itself, she said that it had been submitted to support discussions on e-commerce in the WTO, with a view to achieving progress by the Eleventh Ministerial Conference (MC11). The communication had already been considered at the meeting of the Council for Trade in Goods (CTG) on 17 November 2017. It focused on cross-border trade in goods enabled by the internet, and was based on China’s successful experience with e-commerce. In the past five years, China had experienced an average annual growth rate in e-commerce transactions of 35%. She noted that e-commerce had contributed to economic growth and welfare in China, and her delegation believed that e-commerce could help other developing countries as well. The proposal also emphasized that e-commerce needed to reflect the concept of inclusive trade, thereby providing fair chances for SMEs to participate in, and benefit from, international trade and GVCs. China’s experience proved that small farmers and small businesses in remote areas could be integrated into the domestic and international market with the help of e-commerce. She added that the proposed discussion did not envisage new market access commitments. Rather, the proponents suggested focusing the discussion on the clarification of existing multilateral rules, and on how to more fully benefit from existing market access opportunities. She also emphasized the development dimension of the communication, and shared her delegation's view that work on e-commerce in the WTO needed to proceed progressively, with priority given to the easier issues so as to secure pragmatic progress.","WTCOMTDM100.pdf","WTO, Council, for, Trade, in, Goods, China, China, China, China, WTO"

"180",180,"77","77.    The representative of Benin, on behalf of the LDC Group, highlighted the potential of e-commerce in promoting development, but also believed that Members needed to have a balanced discussion on the subject, within the context of the 1998 Work Programme on E-commerce. In particular, he emphasized the need for discussions to take into account the constraints faced by developing countries, and in particular LDCs. He listed a number of specific challenges that LDCs were experiencing in this regard, including with respect to basic infrastructure and equipment, appropriate regulatory frameworks, cyber security and financing. The low internet penetration rate in LDCs was outlined. He also reaffirmed the importance the LDC                                          WT/COMTD/M/100                                                 - 13 - Group attached to the achievements of results on issues of concern to LDCs in the context of the DDA and paragraph 31 of the Nairobi Ministerial Declaration, and indicated that discussions on e-commerce should not divert Members from these issues. He went on to outline a number of areas which the LDC Group believed could be discussed in the context of e-commerce. In particular, he suggested that discussions could focus on improving online and credit card payment methods, promoting access to electricity, developing e-commerce infrastructure and logistics, providing training and support for SMEs, and promoting digital literacy. He also emphasized the need for discussions on e-commerce to be inclusive and transparent, and to establish a clear link between development and e-commerce, with a view to assessing the issues and challenges for LDCs. In closing, he indicated that the LDC Group was considering the communication, and would make its position known in due course.","WTCOMTDM100.pdf","Benin, LDC, Group, Members, LDCs, DDA, Members, LDC, Group, LDCs, LDC, Group"

At the meeting, the JAG was presented with the ITC's Annual Report for 2015, which highlighted the organization's highest ever delivery, as well as the strategic reforms undertaken and the results achieved. Delegations expressed appreciation for the ITC’s renewed focus on innovation, effectiveness and pragmatic results on the ground, as well as for its investment in measuring and assessing impact. They also appreciated the organization's efforts in supporting UN global goals and WTO Ministerial Decisions, as well the thematic focus on such areas as the economic empowerment of women, the promotion of employment opportunities for young people, and market-led approaches to working with economic migrants and refugees. Delegations additionally recognized other areas of the ITC's work, including with respect to the promotion of South-South cooperation, value chain development, non-tariff measures, and connecting small and medium - sized enterprises (SMEs) to markets. It was noted that almost 80% of the ITC's interventions were delivered to priority countries, including least developed countries (LDCs), landlocked developing countries (LLDCs), small island developing states, Sub-Saharan African, and post-conflict states. There were calls for the ITC to expand its delivery, and for increased and more consistent financing for the organization. In terms of areas for further improvement, delegations had mentioned, inter alia, the need to better express the linkages between results achieved and related costs, the need for more information on the allocation of resources by priority country, and the need to further disaggregate data based on gender, in order to better reflect the impact of the ITC’s work on women’s economic empowerment and gender equality.","WTCOMTDM100.pdf","Chairman, JAG, Group, ITC, ITC, UN, WTO, ITC, ITC, ITC, ITC"

"186",186,"82","82.   The representative of Brazil welcomed the communication, which he noted was focused on trade in goods enabled by electronic means. He also noted that the communication indicated the need to hold discussions on related services and other areas, and in this regard he said that it was important for his delegation that discussions went beyond trade in goods. With regard to the references to tax policies in the proposal, he noted that these issues fell outside the competence of the WTO. He also believed that Members needed to think carefully about the suggestions in the communication relating to bonded warehouses and trade facilitating measures. On issues relating to the infrastructure and related constraints of some Members, and in particular LDCs, he suggested that Section II of the Trade Facilitation Agreement (TFA) could be taken as a reference. In closing, he expressed support for the idea of holding an informal joint meeting of the relevant bodies, and noted that his delegation looked forward to reviewing an elaborated version of the proposal in due course.","WTCOMTDM100.pdf","Brazil, WTO, Members, Members, TFA"

She outlined the growth in e-commerce in the past decade, and highlighted the benefits of participating in e-commerce, particularly for developing countries. She also noted, however, that not many developing countries were able to take advantage of the opportunities that e-commerce provided. The EU’s view was that an improvement in the global trade framework would contribute to enhancing developing countries’ access to e-commerce. She explained that the concept of e-commerce encapsulated many areas – including trade in goods, trade in services and intellectual property. It also had a direct bearing on many development-related issues. It was therefore useful to explore the topic in the CTD, while also continuing the horizontal discussion. Her delegation was open to consider the options with respect to how to continue the horizontal discussion, including within the framework of dedicated sessions, or in the context of the suggested informal joint meetings. She noted that many of the ideas in the communication under consideration were complementary to, and sometimes overlapped with, the elements put forward by the EU and other co-sponsors in document JOB/GC/97/Rev.3. However, more in-depth reflections and discussions would be needed in order to assess the feasibility of some of the ideas raised, and to identify other potential elements that could be missing.","WTCOMTDM100.pdf","European, Union, WTO, EU, CTD, EU"
"191",191,"87","87.    She went on to say that her delegation shared the proponents' view that e-commerce covered a broad range of complex issues. Some of these issues could be addressed for MC11, while others would require more time. The EU also shared the assessment of the potential benefits of e-commerce for development and for SMEs, and supported further work to explore measures which would contribute to improving the infrastructure and related conditions for e-commerce in developing countries. She noted that the Aid-for-Trade framework was already providing support for this, through the Aid-for-Trade Work Programme, and through the analytical work for the next Global Review. In addition, the EU agreed with the importance of providing greater clarity and certainty to the trading community regarding the moratorium on customs duties. In this regard, there was a strong case for making the moratorium permanent. She also noted that a number of ideas had been raised in the communication regarding customs procedures, several of which had been considered in the context of the trade facilitation negotiations. She believed that Members needed to focus on the issues which had the highest chance of reaching consensus, while avoiding contentious topics such as tax policies. Her delegation had additionally noted that a number of ideas were set out in the communication regarding services supporting e-commerce, and believed that some of these issues could form part of Members' discussions. As examples, she cited electronic contracts, e-signatures and e-authentication, and consumer protection. Finally, she expressed support for the transparency-related objectives in the communication.","WTCOMTDM100.pdf","EU, Aid-for-Trade, Work, Programme, Global, Review, EU, Members, Members"

"193",193,"89","89.    The representative of South Africa noted that the communication suggested that work on e-commerce needed to be carried out on the basis of the existing mandate and guidelines, and on the basis of proposals by Members in the relevant bodies, as set out in paragraphs 2 to 5 of the 1998 Work Programme. She also noted that the communication recognized that there was a wide digital divide between Members. In this regard, she stressed the need to ensure that the participation of developing countries and LDCs in e-commerce was enhanced, and that e-commerce brought benefits to all. Consideration needed to be given as to how the discussions and information exchange on e-commerce could support developing countries and LDCs by addressing their concerns on e-commerce, including with regard to productive capacity. The process needed to be transparent and inclusive.

He noted that the communication took into account the process that his delegation had earlier suggested to Members, which was that submissions relating to e-commerce needed to be first taken to the relevant bodies, as set out in paragraphs 2 to 5 of the 1998 Work Programme. Discussions would need to have matured in these bodies before being reported to the General Council. Turning to the content of the communication, he indicated that his delegation sought some clarifications on certain elements. First, he noted that, according to the communication, the proposed discussions aimed to clarify and improve the application of existing multilateral trading rules. Given that the 1998 Work Programme was exploratory in nature, with a mandate to examine and report, he asked the proponents to clarify what their objectives were. Turning next to the reference to tax policies in paragraph 1.1 of the communication, he indicated that such policies were not within the scope of the WTO. He went on to note that the trade facilitation issues mentioned in the communication appeared to already be part of the TFA, and inquired whether the idea of the proponents was to build on the TFA. He also asked how the proponents envisaged the formulation of concrete outcomes on the basis of paragraph 3.2 of the communication, which mentioned the need to improve the infrastructure and technical conditions for developing Members.

"198",198,"93","93.    The representative of the United States said that the communication contained a number of specific proposals that were ripe for collaboration within the WTO. She noted that trade facilitation measures could encourage the transit of goods bought and sold through e-commerce platforms. As suggested in the communication, simplifying border measures for imports and exports, and encouraging the exchange of information on regulatory measures and procedures impacting e-commerce, would encourage increased trade – particularly among SMEs that relied on e-commerce platforms to export. With regard to the communication's recommendation to extend the moratorium on customs duties on electronic transmissions, she observed that this was a step Members had regularly taken, and it had become a cornerstone of the global digital economy. Even beyond extending the moratorium, the US supported making the moratorium permanent, so as to allow digitally enabled firms to more confidently offer their services around the world. She also emphasized the breadth of digital trade, and encouraged the uptake of other related issues beyond trade in goods. She noted that digitally delivered services should be afforded the same protection as services provided in an offline context, and this warranted inclusion in any dialogue in the context of the 1998 Work Programme. In closing, she indicated her delegation's willingness to engage in more detailed discussions on the elements of the communication.","WTCOMTDM100.pdf","United, States, WTO, Members, US"

"219",219,"10","10.    Members were informed that the results of the evaluation were based on four main types of evidence – namely, desk studies of relevant documentation, surveys, interviews, and field missions to a representative sample of beneficiary countries. The evaluation had found that, in the period under consideration, the WTO had made its TA activities more systematic, coordinated and results-oriented through the TA Plan and its support system. Most training components of the planned TA had been largely, and increasingly, effective in their intended results – which was to contribute to the capacities of developing Members to work with multilateral trade rules and negotiations. Internally, however, the planned assistance had not as yet been fully integrated into the wider culture and management practice of the WTO. Finally, as part of the WTO’s strategic vision for the future – with a majority of Members being developing countries – a systematic and professionalized TA programme needed to be valued as a major asset, and part of the core business of the Organization. With regard to the evaluation's specific assessment of the DDAGTF, the key financing role that the Trust Fund had played over the period was highlighted. An overview                                          WT/COMTD/M/101                                                  -4- was provided of the 28 recommendations made by the evaluators. It was noted that six of the recommendations were directed to Members and senior management, while the remaining 22 were directed to the Secretariat. It was further noted that the 22 recommendations for the Secretariat were divided into four categories, which were: (i) participation in training; (ii) technical-assistance instruments; (iii) pedagogical quality; and (iv) monitoring and evaluation.","WTCOMTDM101.pdf","Members, WTO, Members, WTO, WTO, Members, Trust, Fund, Members, Secretariat, Secretariat"

The representative of the United States asked why the LAIA member countries continued to make submissions in the form of reports, which created ambiguity, rather than circulating notifications like other Members did. He recalled that his delegation had in the past indicated its willingness to work with the LAIA countries to find a way forward on the notification of the LAIA agreements, and in this regard he expressed frustration that progress was not being made. He also recalled that his delegation had raised specific questions in both the CTD and the CRTA on the content of the reports, including with respect to the justification for including customs unions and services aspects under the Enabling Clause. On these questions, the LAIA countries had invited his delegation to contact the LAIA secretariat – a non-WTO Member – to obtain the answers, as it was the LAIA secretariat that drafted the reports. He stressed that it was for individual LAIA countries to take responsibility for the documents they submitted to the WTO, and to respond to questions on the RTAs to which they were party.","WTCOMTDM101.pdf","United, States, LAIA, Members, LAIA, LAIA, CTD, CRTA, LAIA, LAIA, Member, LAIA, WTO"

These proposals had been circulated not only in the CTD, but also in a number of other WTO bodies. The CTD document symbols were, respectively, JOB/DEV/39/Rev.1, JOB/DEV/41, JOB/DEV/42 and JOB/DEV/43. He invited the proponents of each proposal to take the floor in turn.","WTCOMTDM101.pdf","Chairman, CTD, WTO, CTD"
"226",226,"106","106. The representative of China recalled that the communication contained in document JOB/DEV/39/Rev.1 had already been considered at the last CTD meeting. She believed that discussions on e-commerce needed to follow the current mandate and focus on the development dimension, so as to advance the common interests of developing Members. In addition, the WTO's work on e-commerce had to be inclusive, and should not involve new market access commitments. Discussions could focus on the promotion and facilitation of cross-border trade in goods enabled by the internet, together with the services that directly supported such trade. With regard to the development dimension of e-commerce, she indicated that her delegation had taken note of the interventions at the last CTD meeting by a number of developing Members. Furthermore, since the last meeting, China had reviewed its relevant domestic policies and regulatory framework. Her delegation intended to share detailed information at the upcoming meetings of the Council for Trade in Goods (CTG) and the Council for Trade in Services (CTS). She went on to provide information on China's experiences in using e-commerce as a means for poverty reduction. The Committee was informed, inter alia, of efforts by the Government to guide and encourage third - party e-commerce business enterprises to establish e-commerce service platforms. Emphasis was placed on making e-commerce benefit the poor, including through encouraging the flow of goods in poor areas, encouraging the poor to establish start-up businesses and create jobs through e-commerce, and broadening sales channels for quality agricultural products from poor areas. She also outlined a number of specific measures being taken to benefit the poor, including with respect to developing infrastructure and industries, constructing a poverty reduction service system for e-commerce, and mobilizing the community.","WTCOMTDM101.pdf","China, Members, WTO, Members, China, Council, for, Trade, in, Goods, CTG, Council, for, Trade, in, Services, China, Committee"
"227",227,"107","107. The representative of Brazil introduced the proposal contained in document JOB/DEV/41. He said that the e-signatures had been identified as relevant in the context of discussions under the 1998 Work Programme. E-signatures had the power to act as a digital identity for a user in the digital environment. Digital certificates produced by authorized and registered providers enabled third parties to ascertain the authenticity of an e-signature. He highlighted e-government as a relevant application of e-signatures. He also referred to India's proposal at the WTO for an Agreement on Trade Facilitation in Services, and explained how a number of concepts outlined in that proposal would benefit from e-signatures. In closing, he noted that the proposal in JOB/DEV/41 had been submitted in the form of a legal text, as it was the outcome of negotiations within MERCOSUR, and had been adopted as a resolution that would apply to the MERCOSUR parties.","WTCOMTDM101.pdf","Brazil, India, WTO, Trade, Facilitation, in, Services, MERCOSUR, MERCOSUR"
"228",228,"108","108. The representative of the European Union said that the approach taken by the co-sponsors of JOB/DEV/42 was to list the trade policy-related elements that they believed were relevant for e - commerce. The development dimension cut across the entire list of issues. He noted that the list was not exhaustive, and was without prejudice to elements that any of the co-sponsors might seek to address individually. The elements listed in the submission were grouped into four clusters. The first cluster related to regulatory frameworks, including in the context of enhanced transparency, measures to promote consumer confidence, and trade facilitating measures. The second cluster was concerned with open markets, which included issues relating to liberalization commitments in goods and services, as well as measures to ensure openness. The focus of the third cluster was on initiatives facilitating the development of e-commerce. Among the elements included under this heading were regulatory cooperation, customs facilitation measures and technical assistance. The fourth cluster focused on the multilateral trading system, and aimed to explore how the WTO could continue to play an important role in enhancing transparency in                                         WT/COMTD/M/101                                                - 20 - Members' policies relating to e-commerce.

"229",229,"109","109. The representative of Singapore said that the objective of the co-sponsors of document JOB/DEV/43 was to contribute to further discussions and reflections on e-commerce at the WTO, with a particular focus on the nexus between development and e-commerce. The proposal identified a few potential areas of interest and relevance to developing countries in the e - commerce area. While the co-sponsors recognized the importance of e-commerce for both developed and developing countries, they also believed that the use of e-commerce in developing countries had certain unique characteristics. He invited Members to share their experiences in this regard, including with respect to any challenges faced in leveraging e-commerce for development.","WTCOMTDM101.pdf","Singapore, WTO, Members"
"230",230,"11","11.    The Director-General said that the WTO's TA was vital to ensure that developing countries received the necessary practical support to build capacity and skills, so that they could fully participate in the trading system and leverage the opportunities that trade provided. This was a priority for him. While TA was not mentioned as one of the main functions of the WTO in Article III of the Marrakesh Agreement, nor was it initially a major part of the Organization's work, it had over time become a central element of the WTO's activities. However, the way in which this work had evolved had not always been strategically planned. This was because most programmes had resulted from a combination of requests from Members, initiatives of the Secretariat and independent developments – rather than from the implementation of a pre-conceived strategic plan. In this light, the evaluation provided the opportunity for a broader and more strategic discussion about what the objectives of the WTO's TA should be, and the approach to be taken. He next turned to the results of the evaluation and noted, inter alia, that the WTO's TA activities had been found to be highly relevant and aligned to the needs and priorities of the beneficiaries, while also making an effective use of time and resources. Although the results were generally positive, he also indicated that there was always room for improvement. In this regard, he noted that the evaluation report offered some recommendations on areas where the TA work could be strengthened in order to improve the impact on the ground. He cited a number of examples, including with respect to improving communications between all the parties involved in TA activities, improving the effectiveness of the activities, incorporating gender issues, opening at least some training courses to wider audiences, and the need to take a more strategic review of the work. Members were invited to share their views on how to address the recommendations.","WTCOMTDM101.pdf","Director-General, WTO, TA, WTO, Organization, WTO, Members, Secretariat, WTO, WTO, Members"

"232",232,"111","111. The representative of Thailand, on behalf of ASEAN, expressed the interest of ASEAN to continue e-commerce discussions in the WTO under the 1998 Work Programme. Enhanced information and experience sharing would help gain a better understanding of how the WTO could help Members achieve their trade policy objectives in the area of e-commerce. In this regard, she expressed appreciation for the seminar on e-payments and financial inclusion that was organized on 13 March 2017 by the Friends of E-Commerce for Development (FED). She said that, for ASEAN, the benefits of e-commerce went beyond creating trade and business opportunities. E - commerce also contributed to overall economic development, as well as to the promotion of cultural exchanges and social cohesion, which were critical for regional integration. Indicating that ASEAN had many e-commerce success stories, she went on to provide some examples of micro, small and medium-sized enterprises (MSMEs) in the region that had been able to scale up their use of technology and e-commerce in order to compete effectively with global players. It was also noted that the rapidly evolving nature of e-commerce meant that policymakers had to constantly play catch-up in order to ensure a conducive regulatory environment for businesses to grow.","WTCOMTDM101.pdf","Thailand, ASEAN, ASEAN, WTO, WTO, Members, ASEAN, ASEAN"
"233",233,"112","112. She went on to provide an overview of how ASEAN had addressed e-commerce over the years in its FTAs, starting with the launch of the e-ASEAN Framework Agreement in 2000. The ASEAN-Australia-New Zealand FTA, which entered into force in 2010, contained an e-commerce chapter. An e-commerce chapter was also being negotiated in the context of the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership. In 2012, ASEAN worked with UNCTAD to conduct a review of its e-commerce legislation. The review, which showed that ASEAN performed best in the area of electronic transaction laws, highlighted new regulatory issues arising from evolving technologies, and also made several recommendations. She added that, in the ASEAN Economic Community Blueprint 2025 – which was adopted at the 27th ASEAN Summit on 22 November 2015 – ASEAN leaders had agreed to intensify cooperation on e-commerce with a view to developing an ASEAN Agreement on E-Commerce to help facilitate cross-border e-commerce transactions in the region. An ASEAN Coordinating Committee on E-Commerce had also been created, and work was underway to establish an ASEAN E-Commerce Work Programme. It was expected that the initiatives within ASEAN would help all ASEAN countries be e-commerce ready, and would contribute to their development. In closing, she indicated that ASEAN welcomed the high level of interest in e-commerce at the WTO. As Members were at different levels of e-commerce readiness, it was important to maintain the momentum by continuing substantive discussions in the relevant Committees.","WTCOMTDM101.pdf","ASEAN, ASEAN-Australia-New, Zealand, FTA, Regional, Comprehensive, Economic, Partnership, ASEAN, UNCTAD, ASEAN, ASEAN, ASEAN, ASEAN, ASEAN, ASEAN, Coordinating, Committee, on, E-Commerce, ASEAN, E-Commerce, Work, Programme, ASEAN, ASEAN, ASEAN, WTO, Members"

The representative of Chile believed that document JOB/DEV/42, of which her delegation was a co-sponsor, provided a starting point for facilitating a discussion on possible areas of work on e-commerce at the WTO. She drew the Committee’s attention to the questions that were raised at the end of the document, and in particular invited Members to consider which elements relating to e-commerce they wished to have focused discussions on in the CTD.","WTCOMTDM101.pdf","Chile, WTO, Committee, Members, CTD"
"235",235,"114","114. The representative of Costa Rica said that e-commerce brought the digital, development and trade agendas together. While e-commerce carried with it important challenges, it also provided many opportunities for developing countries. It was an instrument for inclusive development and economic growth. She elaborated on the potential benefits to MSMEs in particular, and noted that the WTO's engagement in e-commerce needed to focus on the development dimension, so as to allow a more inclusive and sustainable participation of all countries.

She noted that Paraguay was a co-sponsor of the proposals contained in documents JOB/DEV/41 and JOB/DEV/42. With regard to document JOB/DEV/41, she said that e - signatures could be used as a trade facilitation tool that would ensure the authenticity, integrity and privacy of cross-border internet transactions and communications, thus providing greater security and predictability. Members were encouraged to consider the matter further. With regard to the proposal contained in document JOB/DEV/39/Rev.1, she indicated that her delegation had previously made comments on the issue of transparency and notification of laws and regulations.","WTCOMTDM101.pdf","Paraguay, Paraguay, Members"
"237",237,"116","116. The representative of the Republic of Korea said that discussions on e-commerce at the WTO had not progressed enough to keep pace with real-world developments. He suggested that the aim of future discussions should be on deepening Members' understanding of the implications of e - commerce for trade and development. In this regard, he indicated that the 13 March 2017 seminar on e-payments and financial inclusion had been particularly useful. He hoped that other events on the development implications of e-commerce could be organized in the future.","WTCOMTDM101.pdf","Republic, of, Korea, WTO, Members"
"238",238,"117","117. The representative of Ecuador indicated that she wished to provide comments on some of the proposals under consideration. Starting with document JOB/DEV/39/Rev.1, she supported the view that discussions on e-commerce needed to take place within the context of the 1998 Work Programme, and should not entail new market access commitments. She also stressed that addressing the digital divide needed to be a priority for Members. Turning to document JOB/DEV/42, she shared her delegation's view that the proposal appeared to go beyond the mandate of the 1998 Work Programme. She explained that, although the proposal contained some elements that constituted topics for discussion, it also contained elements relating to an outcome based on market openings, which would necessarily involve a negotiating process. In this light, she suggested that the proposal would need to be adjusted in order to make it consistent with the 1998 Work Programme. Finally, with regard to document JOB/DEV/43, she observed that the elements addressed in the proposal focused on providing solutions to some of the problems faced by developing countries in using e-commerce, particularly for MSMEs. She believed that the issues raised in documents JOB/DEV/39/Rev.1 and JOB/DEV/43 could provide starting points for a much - needed debate on the digital divide.","WTCOMTDM101.pdf","Ecuador, Members"
"239",239,"118","118. The representative of Pakistan recognized the role that e-commerce could play in promoting inclusive trade and helping to achieve development goals. He pointed to the knowledge gap and digital divide that existed between developed and developing countries, and urged Members to engage constructively in discussions on e-commerce, focusing in particular on the development dimension. He recalled that the FED, of which his delegation was part, had organized a seminar on e-payments and financial inclusion on 13 March 2017. His delegation was also a co-sponsor of two of the proposals under consideration.","WTCOMTDM101.pdf","Pakistan, Members, FED"
"240",240,"119","119. The representative of Cameroon said that Members’ priority had to be in addressing the digital divide. He elaborated on how many developing countries did not have the infrastructure to participate in e-commerce, and in this light indicated that discussions in the WTO at the present time should not be about new commitments. What was important was to ensure that all Members could benefit from e-commerce. He suggested that Members could consider how existing WTO rules, including with respect to S&D, could be used to make e-commerce more inclusive, while contributing to poverty reduction and development.","WTCOMTDM101.pdf","Cameroon, Members, WTO, Members, Members, WTO"
"241",241,"12","12.    He also noted that, given the size of the TA portfolio, the evaluation had not been able assess or provide conclusions on specific TA activities or programmes. Similarly, the evaluation had not looked into such non-training TA programmes as the Geneva Week, the WTO Chairs Programme, and other outreach activities, or the wider range of capacity-building activities that the WTO conducted. He therefore suggested that further work might be needed to look at the effectiveness of the individual programmes and activities, and to take a holistic look at coordination across all areas. In light of the likely future growth in importance of the WTO's TA, he believed that it was necessary to assess the role of TA going forward, and to explore what could be done better – including through improved coordination, and by working with partners in particular areas. He highlighted the importance of capacity building within the Trade Facilitation Agreement, and raised the question of whether this would be replicated in future agreements. In concluding, he emphasized the usefulness of the evaluation. He informed the Committee that the Secretariat would soon begin preparing the TA Plan for the 2018-2019 period, and urged Members to ensure that the present discussion on the evaluation would feed into that process.","WTCOMTDM101.pdf","Geneva, Week, WTO, Chairs, Programme, WTO, WTO, TA, Committee, Secretariat, TA, Plan, Members"
"242",242,"120","120. The representative of India recognized that e-commerce had become a major driver of international economic activity and international trade. In India, e-commerce was transforming the way business was being conducted, and represented one of the fastest growing segments of the economy. However, as with any new and emerging area of technology, the regulatory frameworks and institutions to support e-commerce were still at an evolutionary stage. While there had been a significant evolution in the technology relating to e-commerce since the adoption of the 1998 Work Programme, there was little clarity on the trade-related dimensions of e-commerce and how to address them. For example, clarity was required on a host of technical issues, including the definition and scope of e-commerce, and the interface between e-commerce and digital trade. Other issues included the definition of electronic transmissions in the context of the moratorium on custom duties, the classification of e-commerce transactions as goods or services, and questions relating to the reporting of e-commerce transactions in national and international trade statistics. His delegation believed that the lack of credible and comparable statistics relating to e-commerce was a real challenge for evidence-based policy making. Furthermore, most developing countries                                          WT/COMTD/M/101                                                 - 22 - were grappling with basic access and connectivity issues. It was noted, inter alia, in this regard that around 70% of the population in India did not have internet access, particularly in rural areas. At the same time, the global e-commerce market was highly asymmetrical and monopolistic, and was dominated by a few large technology firms.","WTCOMTDM101.pdf","India, India, India"
"243",243,"121","121. He added that the growth of e-commerce activities had given birth to new challenges, both for domestic and for cross-border trade. These included issues related to consumer protection and the sale of counterfeit goods and services, the safety of online payments, e-authentication procedures and digital signatures, and taxation. There were also challenges relating to shortages of skilled manpower, human resource development and logistics. In most developing countries, including in India, rules on these and related areas were still evolving. Therefore, the view of his delegation was that it was premature to discuss rule-making in the area of e-commerce. What would be appropriate was for e-commerce discussions to be limited to the non-negotiating mandate of the 1998 Work Programme. In the CTD, discussions on e-commerce needed to focus on addressing the development needs of developing countries. Given that the growth of digital trade and e-commerce were technology-dependent, a critical component of discussions had to be on ensuring an adequate transfer of technology. He believed that Members needed to consider ways of reducing the digital divide, promoting increased internet access and enhancing the mobilization of financial resources to develop the digital infrastructure in developing countries and LDCs. He also highlighted the importance of cooperation amongst Members, and the sharing of experiences in areas such as consumer protection, safety of online payments, taxation, human resource development and logistics. Cooperation in the area of cyber security, electronic signatures and electronic documents were also important. In closing, he stressed the need for greater efforts by national governments and the international community to enhance the readiness of countries to engage in, and benefit from, digital trade.","WTCOMTDM101.pdf","India, CTD, Members, Members"
"244",244,"122","122. The representative of Norway believed that it was useful to have a thorough discussion in the CTD on the development dimension of e-commerce. She said that a prerequisite for e - commerce to flourish was a high degree of trust in the digital environment. In this regard, she pointed to the importance of supporting a good consumer environment online, and ensuring transparency. Turing to the proposal contained in document JOB/DEV/42, she indicated that the document provided a structured approach and a useful overview of a number of aspects that Members would need to address. However, the list was not exhaustive, and it was also important to take into consideration any specific aspects that could be relevant for developing Members and LDCs. She agreed with the proponents of document JOB/DEV/39/Rev.1 that Members needed to take the issue of e-commerce and digital trade step by step, and in this regard suggested that a good first step could be to look at improvements in technical conditions for cross-border e - commerce, including with regard to e-signatures, authentication and certificates. She stressed the need to find elements of commonality in the various submissions, especially in the context of what would allow e-commerce to benefit all Members – and in particular developing Members. In addition, it was important to identify the areas in which WTO rules and guidelines could make a difference, and would thereby allow Members to put in place the necessary domestic rules that would enhance their capacity to participate in international trade through e-commerce. She concluded by highlighting the need for Members to discuss the extension of the moratorium on customs duties on electronic transmissions, which her delegation supported.","WTCOMTDM101.pdf","Norway, CTD, Members, Members, Members, Members, Members, WTO, Members, Members"
"245",245,"123","123. The representative of South Africa, on behalf of the African Group indicated that the tabling of submissions in the CTD was in line with paragraph 1.1 of the 1998 Work Programme, and consistent with paragraph 1 of the Nairobi Decision on e-commerce. She said that continental integration, structural transformation and industrialization were the overriding priorities for Africa, as had been laid out by African Trade Ministers. She made reference in this regard to the Continental Free Trade Area, as well as to Agenda 2063: The Africa We Want, and emphasized the need for work undertaken at the multilateral level to support Africa’s continental integration agenda. With regard to e-commerce, she said that the African Group approached the exploratory discussions under the 1998 Work Programme from a perspective that gave paramount importance to the development implications of e-commerce, taking into account the economic, financial, and development needs of developing countries. In this light, she believed that several issues that were included in the proposals under consideration were better suited for discussion in the CTG, the CTS or the TRIPS Council. Furthermore, some of the issues fell outside the scope of the 1998 Work Programme, or were being taken up extensively in other international organizations. She urged the proponents to refine their proposals in order to make them specific to the body where discussions should take place, as per the Work Programme.

"246",246,"124","124. She went on to say that the African Group wanted the CTD to take up issues that placed at their centre the needs of developing countries and LDCs. She highlighted in this regard the importance of addressing ways of enhancing the participation of developing countries in e - commerce, and the associated challenges. A number of examples were provided, including with respect to infrastructure, industrialization and workforce skills. It was noted that the potential benefits of e-commerce for developing countries could not be assumed or asserted. It was pointed out, inter alia, in this regard that fixed broadband penetration remained at 0.7% in Africa and the LDCs, and Africa was the only region in the world where broadband penetration remained below 20%. Bringing about socially equalizing effects would not be possible when only some had access to digital technology – whilst others had partial or no access, and also had no rights over the technology. According to UNCTAD, four countries accounted for 80% of business-to-business (B2B) e-commerce, which was the largest form of e-trade. With regard to business-to-consumer (B2C) e-commerce, the Middle East and Africa together accounted for only 2.5%. Accordingly, discussions in the CTD had to address the asymmetrical nature of the existing global e-commerce space, in order to enable Africa to become e-commerce ready. One of the overriding questions of the African Group was how to build an inclusive growth and equitable development trajectory for all developing countries and LDCs. She encouraged Members to share their experiences on measures employed to develop capabilities in the digital economy. In closing, she expressed the commitment of the African Group to engage in a comprehensive discussion in the CTD on all issues relating to the development implications of e-commerce.","WTCOMTDM101.pdf","African, Group, CTD, Africa, Africa, UNCTAD, Middle, East, Africa, CTD, Africa, Members, African, Group, CTD"
"247",247,"125","125. The representative of Canada said that the communication contained in document JOB/DEV/42 that her delegation had co-sponsored aimed to stimulate discussion on the elements of trade policy that could be addressed to promote inclusive economic growth through e - commerce. Her delegation believed that the CTD was an important forum for this discussion. She went on to highlight some of the opportunities associated with e-commerce, while also recognizing that the digital divide prevented countries from tapping into these opportunities. She suggested that the CTD could explore how the WTO could contribute to efforts aiming to further facilitate e-commerce to the benefit of all Members. The trade policy elements contained in the communication could help to provide an enabling environment for the development of e-commerce in developing countries, and the CTD could examine the development dimension of many of these elements. The WTO could add value to the work being carried out in other international organizations – through its transparency function and its negotiating function, and through the provision of TA and capacity building. Other international agencies had to also be encouraged to continue to address barriers to the effective harnessing of e-commerce for sustainable development, and to coordinate on relevant issues. She gave the example in this regard of the establishment at UNCTAD of an Intergovernmental Group of Experts on E-Commerce. She further pointed to the importance of international cooperation on e-commerce, and noted that Canada sought to incorporate such articles in its trade agreements. A number of elements that could be included in articles of this nature were provided, including, inter alia, with respect to the exchange of information, collaboration to assist small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), and enhancing national regulatory capacity.","WTCOMTDM101.pdf","Canada, CTD, WTO, Members, CTD, WTO, UNCTAD, Intergovernmental, Group, Canada"
"248",248,"126","126. The representative of Japan emphasized the importance that his delegation attached to e - commerce, including in the context of enabling inclusive trade. Referring to the proposal contained in document JOB/DEV/39/Rev.1, he said that his delegation wished to hear more from the proponents on concrete measures that could be taken by the WTO to improve infrastructure and the technical conditions for the development of cross-border e-commerce. With regard to the MC11 and beyond, he believed that Members needed to consider the WTO's work on e-commerce in a pragmatic and focused way. His delegation looked forward to engaging in active discussions on e-commerce.","WTCOMTDM101.pdf","Japan, WTO, Members, WTO"
"249",249,"127","127. The representative of Uganda, on behalf of the LDC Group, noted that the proponents of the various proposals had taken into account the process that had been earlier suggested to Members, which was that submissions relating to e-commerce needed to be first taken to the relevant bodies, as set out in paragraphs 2 to 5 of the 1998 Work Programme. Discussions would need to have matured in these bodies before being reported to the General Council. He recalled a number of elements from paragraphs 1.1 and 1.2 of the Work Programme, and emphasized that the non - negotiating mandate of the Work Programme was exploratory in nature. He went on to say that, since the establishment of the Work Programme, the digital divide for LDCs had widened. In theory, e-commerce was supposed to help surmount the obstacles faced by weaker countries when competing with stronger players. However, in reality, most LDCs had to deal with a number                                           WT/COMTD/M/101                                                  - 24 - of constraints – relating to insufficiencies in basic infrastructure, electricity and internet access, as well as to the high cost of broadband connectivity. LDCs also faced a number of bottlenecks that prevented them from taking advantage of the opportunities that were theoretically available through e-commerce platforms. The LDC Group believed that, in order for LDCs to be able to benefit from e-commerce, the three key issues were access, affordability and availability. He went on to provide some figures to put into context the present situation of the LDCs. He mentioned, inter alia, in this regard that only 15% of the population in LDCs used the internet. Fixed broadband penetration remained at below 1% in Africa and the LDCs. In light of the low penetration rate in internet use, LDCs were not in a position to take advantage of the benefits of e-commerce.","WTCOMTDM101.pdf","Uganda, LDC, Group, Members, General, Council, Work, Programme, Work, Programme, Work, Programme, LDCs, LDCs, LDC, Group, Africa, LDCs"
"250",250,"128","128. He indicated that discussions under the Work Programme needed to focus on overcoming the challenges that were hindering LDCs from becoming e-commerce-ready. It was suggested that discussions could focus on a number of specific issues, including access to electricity, access to digital infrastructure and cheap and fast broadband, inadequate skills, and technology transfer. He went on to express support for the intervention by the African Group, and noted in particular that most of the proposals under consideration fell outside the scope and mandate of the 1998 Work Programme. He invited the proponents to narrow down their submissions to issues specific to the CTD, and to focus on the elements contained in paragraph 5.1 of the Work Programme, with a view to addressing the digital divide. He also highlighted the need to complement, and not undermine, initiatives within Africa, and in particular Agenda 2063: The Africa We Want. He believed that it was important to examine the implications of e-commerce on the structural transformation and industrialization of Africa, and what the impact would be on domestic markets, domestic manufacturers and service suppliers. Finally, he outlined the plans of the International Telecommunications Union to connect 1.5 billion people to the internet, and regretted that funds were not being made available for this purpose. In this regard, he expressed concern with the downward trajectory in Aid for Trade, particularly for LDCs, and stressed the need for consistency in the message and practice of donors.","WTCOMTDM101.pdf","Work, Programme, African, Group, CTD, Work, Programme, Africa, Africa, International, Telecommunications, Union, LDCs"

The representative of Peru recognized the importance of e-commerce for economic growth and development, and noted that a chapter on e-commerce was included in most of the trade agreements to which Peru was party. Peru was also working actively in various agencies to encourage commitments on e-commerce and related matters, with a focus on development. He expressed interest in learning more about the technical details of the proposals under consideration, in order to identify specific ways for Members to move forward, including in the context of an outcome at MC11.","WTCOMTDM101.pdf","Peru, Peru, Peru, Members"

The representative of Norway, on behalf of the Steering Committee of the evaluation, reminded Members that the evaluation had been undertaken independently, and that the findings and recommendations were those of the external consultants. The task of the Steering Committee had been to supervise the process. While individual members of the Steering Committee would make statements during the present discussion, the Steering Committee would refrain from commenting on the findings of the evaluation, or on the WTO management response. After expressing appreciation to those who had contributed to the evaluation process, she indicated that the Steering Committee was interested in hearing Members' views on how best to ensure that the evaluation and its findings would provide guidance for the WTO's work in this area, with a view to achieving even more targeted, results-oriented and efficient TA programmes. A possible course of action in this regard was for Members to form an implementation support group, consisting of donors and beneficiaries, so as to provide oversight in the follow-up to the evaluation.","WTCOMTDM101.pdf","Norway, Steering, Committee, Members, Steering, Committee, Steering, Committee, Steering, Committee, WTO, Steering, Committee, Members, WTO, Members"

With regard to the proposal contained in document JOB/DEV/39/Rev.1, he indicated that his delegation was supportive of many of the ideas contained therein, including with regard to the recommendation to extend the moratorium on the imposition of customs duties on electronic transmissions. Colombia was particularly interested in the topics outlined in the first section of the proposal, in light of its successful experiences in areas such as streamlined procedures for customs clearance, inspection and quarantine, and the promotion of paperless trade, He also noted that the proposal encompassed elements which could have a favourable impact on the development of physical and legal infrastructure, which he believed was one of the main obstacles faced by developing countries in using e-commerce. In this regard, he made particular reference to the suggestion in the proposal to explore concrete measures to improve infrastructure and technical conditions, including in the context of Aid for Trade. The mention in paragraphs 1.3 and 3.1 of the need for information exchange was additionally welcomed, in particular in the context of the benefits this would bring to MSMEs. With regard to section 2, concerning transparency commitments, he invited the proponents to review their suggestions, as these were already part of existing commitments in goods and services. His delegation also wished to gain a better understanding from the proponents on paragraph 5.2, and in particular the role they envisaged for the Secretariat. It was additionally noted that the proposal covered only one of the dimensions of e-commerce, and in this regard he expressed hope that discussions on e-commerce could encompass other areas as well.","WTCOMTDM101.pdf","Colombia, Colombia, Secretariat"
"254",254,"131","131. He went on to say that he wished to share some of his country’s experiences in the context of infrastructure and connectivity development. He outlined in particular elements of Colombia’s Vive Digital Plan for the 2010-2014 period, which had the objective of developing the necessary infrastructure to enhance connectivity and internet access across the country. The success of the                                         WT/COMTD/M/101                                                - 25 - initiative could be attributed to the close partnership between the public and private sectors, and in particular the consultative approach which had allowed the needs of the private sector to be identified and incorporated into the programme. To ensure continuity, a further plan for the 2014-2018 period had been established. Specific approaches were being implemented, including on a regional basis, and with a focus on education and employment. In closing, he stressed the importance of e-commerce in promoting development. He also expressed his delegation's willingness to discuss initiatives to facilitate trade in goods and services by electronic means.","WTCOMTDM101.pdf","Colombia, Vive, Digital, Plan"
"255",255,"132","132. The representative of Australia highlighted the role of e-commerce as a driver of international trade, inclusive economic growth and development. She observed in particular that e - commerce facilitated the participation of MSMEs in global trade. The view of her delegation was that the WTO could contribute to the trade-related aspects of e-commerce for the benefit of all Members. She noted that the proposal contained in document JOB/DEV/43 highlighted several aspects of e-commerce of particular relevance to developing countries, and went on to provide some comments on this proposal. With regard to trade facilitation and e-commerce, she agreed that taking steps in the WTO to facilitate cross-border e-commerce would contribute to development, and to the greater participation of MSMEs in global trade. In this context, she highlighted the certainty provided by the moratorium on customs duties, and encouraged Members to extend or make permanent the moratorium. She also welcomed the entry into force of the Trade Facilitation Agreement, and called for the full implementation of the Agreement to further enable cross-border e-commerce. On the issue of access to payment solutions, her delegation wished to hear more on how the WTO could contribute. With regard to infrastructure gaps, she recognized that addressing such gaps in developing countries and LDCs was a critical element in the creation of an enabling environment for e-commerce. Examples were provided of projects implemented by Australia, including the ASEAN-Australia Development Cooperation Programme Phase II, as well as projects relating to internet connectivity in Tonga and Fiji, telecommunications in Vanuatu, and mobile coverage in Kiribati and the Solomon Islands. In closing, she called for cooperation between relevant international agencies and others pursuing initiatives to close infrastructure gaps.","WTCOMTDM101.pdf","Australia, WTO, Members, WTO, Members, WTO, LDCs, Australia, ASEAN-Australia, Development, Cooperation, Programme, Tonga, Fiji, Vanuatu, Kiribati, Solomon, Islands"

The representative of Hong Kong, China noted the link between e-commerce and development, and indicated that her delegation was a co-sponsor of the proposal contained in document JOB/DEV/43. She stressed the need for the active participation of SMEs and MSMEs in global trade, but also recognized the difficulties they faced in terms of resources, technology and infrastructure. Her delegation therefore supported any initiative or discussion that could help create a reliable business environment, improve infrastructure, and build the capacity of SMEs and MSMEs to participate in e-commerce.","WTCOMTDM101.pdf","Hong, Kong, China"

He noted that e-commerce offered additional ways to do business, which complemented the modalities already provided for by traditional trade. Furthermore, an appropriate legal and regulatory framework, covering aspects such as e-signatures and consumer protection, would ensure consumer confidence and make transactions more secure. He went on to highlight the potential of e-commerce in integrating SMEs into global value chains and promoting development. He noted that events such as the seminar organized on 13 March 2017 by the FED on e-payments and financial inclusion would help Members to make progress on issues such as the digital divide.","WTCOMTDM101.pdf","Mexico, FED, Members"

She recognized the importance of e-commerce and digital trade, and welcomed discussions in the context of the 1998 Work Programme. She went on to say that the economies that had advanced in terms of digital trade and e-commerce had done so by using all the policy space at their disposal, and without any of the multilateral trade rules or disciplines on e-commerce that some Members were proposing. Moreover, e-commerce continued to grow rapidly in these countries. She said that it was imperative to maintain the same policy space for other countries – particularly developing countries – that had not yet developed their e-commerce and digital trade. It was also important to desist from imposing rules or disciplines at a time when developing countries were not e-commerce ready. She believed that it was premature to consider rules or disciplines on e-commerce, as such rules would benefit Members which were already technologically advanced. Furthermore, rules on e-commerce would widen the digital divide, thereby further excluding developing countries and LDCs.

"259",259,"136","136. She noted with concern that, while there was no mandate for work to be undertaken on e - commerce rules or disciplines, some of the proposals under consideration had been drafted in these terms. Furthermore, there were elements that were outside the scope of the Marrakesh Agreement, some which went beyond the current mandate on e-commerce, and some which went beyond the mandate of the CTD. Those going beyond the CTD’s mandate needed to be considered in relevant bodies such as the CTS or the TRIPS Council. Furthermore, some proposals had overlooked the importance of consumer protection and privacy, whilst others had duplicated the work of other international organizations that had the full mandate over issues such as cybercrime and cyber security. Some proposals would affect Members’ schedules of goods and services commitments, while in a number of cases the objectives and the problems to be addressed were not clearly specified. She called on the proponents to revise their proposals so as to be in line with the 1998 Work Programme. She also stressed the need to continue discussions based on the current mandate, focusing on the development dimension. In addition to the exchange of information, she believed that Members needed to consider concrete ways to bridge the digital divide.","WTCOMTDM101.pdf","CTD, CTD, CTS, Members, Members"

The representative of Nigeria said that the paradigm shift to e-commerce in business transactions provided significant benefits, including with respect to market expansion, customer services improvements, and productivity enhancement. He noted that e-commerce in Nigeria was growing at an estimated annual rate of 25%, and underscored the importance of digital technology for Nigeria’s economic diversification. His delegation, as part of the FED, was actively participating in a number of activities related to e-commerce. Nigeria was also a co-sponsor of document JOB/DEV/43. He went on to say that, according to various analyses, the most fundamental areas to address in order to unleash the potential of developing countries in digital trade concerned infrastructure, trade logistics and facilitation, and electronic payments. He believed that Members needed to address the bottlenecks that developing countries faced, including with regard to payment methods, financial technologies, trade finance, financial inclusion, logistics and customs requirements. In closing, he stressed the importance of examining the costs and benefits of both action and inaction on e-commerce at the WTO. He believed that Members needed to consider taking a forward-looking approach that could lead to a concrete outcome at MC11, beyond the 1998 Work Programme. He also drew Members' attention to UNCTAD's E-Commerce Week, which would he held on 24-28 April 2017.","WTCOMTDM101.pdf","Nigeria, Nigeria, Nigeria, FED, Nigeria, Members, WTO, Members, Members, UNCTAD, E-Commerce, Week"

"262",262,"139","139. The representative of Singapore said that the digital divide was a real and persisting problem. The lack of infrastructure and an enabling regulatory framework continued to impede the development of e-commerce in some countries. The view of his delegation was that the development dimension of e-commerce had to go beyond hard infrastructure. It was necessary to also address issues relating to soft infrastructure, such as regulatory frameworks, as this would also be conducive to the development of e-commerce, while generating inclusive economic growth. With regard to the way forward on e-commerce, he believed that the WTO might not be able to provide the hard infrastructure needed for basic internet connectivity, or access to power supply. However, it could serve as a platform to discuss best practices and encourage information exchange on enabling regulatory frameworks that could potentially narrow the digital divide and help enhance the participation of developing countries and LDCs in e-commerce. Much of this could take place through the regular work of the WTO, including discussions on e-commerce in Members' TPRs, transparency notifications on related-measures in the CTS, and discussions on e- commerce chapters on RTAs in the CRTA. He also encouraged Member-driven initiatives, such as the seminar on e-payments and financial inclusion that had been held on 13 March 2017.","WTCOMTDM101.pdf","Singapore, WTO, LDCs, WTO, Members, CTS, CRTA"
"263",263,"14","14.   The representative of Norway stressed the importance of evaluations in assessing the effects of development assistance. For Norway, as a donor, it was crucial to know whether the public funding channelled into trade-related TA was contributing to the intended objective of integrating developing countries, and in particular the least developed countries (LDCs), into the multilateral trading system. Regular evaluations allowed more knowledge to be gained on how training programmes should be managed in order to have the best possible effect. However, evaluations                                          WT/COMTD/M/101                                                  -5- were only one part of the results-based management (RBM) cycle, as continuous monitoring and feedback from beneficiaries was crucial in measuring short-term results. He noted in this regard that the Secretariat had encountered difficulties in getting feedback from participants, and therefore highlighted the need for Members to find a way to ensure that the requested questionnaires and reports were submitted to the WTO. Turning to the evaluation, he expressed satisfaction with the overall conclusion that the WTO's TA was relevant and largely effective. He highlighted in particular the recommendation that TA needed to be recognized as part of the core business of the WTO, and in this regard indicated that more funding needed to come from the regular budget. Norway also supported the recommendation to integrate gender equality into the TA programmes. Continuing the monitoring and reporting on the gender balance of participants was important, although this was only a first step. On the suggestion for a specifically designed course for the private sector, he believed that this needed to be explored further. An online course could be a realistic option to start with. Finally, he indicated that the possibility of developing new training options to follow up on the Trade Policy Reviews (TPRs) merited further discussion, particularly in the context of finding ways for the TPR process to provide additional benefits to developing countries.","WTCOMTDM101.pdf","Norway, Norway, RBM, Secretariat, Members, WTO, WTO, WTO, Norway, TPR"
"264",264,"140","140. He went on to share some of Singapore's experiences with e-commerce, particularly with regard to MSMEs. He said that the approach taken by Singapore was to put in place the right legal and policy frameworks that would support the participation of MSMEs in e-commerce. He gave the example of MSMEs in the food manufacturing industry in Singapore. Thanks to e-commerce, this sector was thriving, and Singapore's MSMEs were selling to China and India, as well as to some African countries. This success was due in part to the use of trade policy, which ensured the predictability of trade rules and provided confidence to MSMEs wishing to venture into the overseas markets. A sound legal and policy framework had also played a key role in attracting                                         WT/COMTD/M/101                                                - 27 - foreign e-commerce players to provide services in Singapore. The synergies between Singapore's local MSMEs and bigger e-commerce players had facilitated the development of a vibrant e - commerce environment, and had helped to foster innovation and growth. He also outlined a number of initiatives by the Government to help Singapore's MSMEs participate in e-commerce, including with regard to e-signatures, paperless trading, e-payments and transparency. In closing, he invited Members to explore in which areas the WTO could contribute to leveraging e-commerce as a tool for growth and development.","WTCOMTDM101.pdf","Singapore, Singapore, Singapore, Singapore, China, India, Singapore, Singapore, Singapore, Members, WTO"

The representative of Montenegro said that the expansion of the digital economy would foster new opportunities for the promotion of inclusive economic growth – for example by connecting rural and urban economies, opening new channels for landlocked countries' trade, and facilitating the participation of women and micro enterprises in the formal economy. She noted that her delegation was a co-sponsor of the proposal contained in document JOB/DEV/42. The development dimension of e-commerce cut across the entire list of issues outlined in the proposal, and many topics were directly or indirectly framed to contribute to the development of e - commerce. She indicated a particular interest to discuss a limited set of concrete rules to facilitate electronic transactions, such as e-contracts, e-signatures and regulatory frameworks relating to consumer protection and unsolicited messages. She added that her delegation looked forward to drawing from the 13 March 2017 seminar on e-payments and financial inclusion, and to working towards a tangible result on e-commerce at MC11.","WTCOMTDM101.pdf","Montenegro"

He made reference to issues such as e-signatures, consumer protection, customs procedures and enhancing the participation of SMEs in e-commerce. He agreed with the proponents on the importance of providing greater clarity and certainty for the trading community, and in this regard highlighted the importance of the moratorium on imposing custom duties on electronic transmissions. He suggested that Members should focus on issues that would have the highest chance of being harvested, whilst avoiding contentious ones like those relating to taxation policy. Turning to document JOB/DEV/43, he agreed on the need to address the development aspects of e-commerce. He believed that further discussion was required in order to close the digital divide. The EU remained open to considering any mechanism that could support the development of the necessary enabling environment to enhance participation in e-commerce. With regard to document JOB/DEV/42, of which the EU was a co-sponsor, he indicated that the communication could be further refined to fit better with the CTD’s terms of reference, thereby taking into account some Members’ concerns. While the communication was not a negotiating proposal, it nevertheless contained a mapping of relevant issues at the intersection of trade and e-commerce. The objective was to allow Members to decide collectively which of these issues should be discussed. He went on to say that his delegation was interested in discussing concrete rules that would facilitate electronic transactions, including rules that would help create an environment favourable to SMEs. These discussions could cover issues such as e-contract, e-signature, and regulatory frameworks relating to consumer protection and spam. He concluded by indicating his delegation’s interest to participate in follow-up discussions on the issues raised at the 13 March 2017 seminar on e-payments and financial inclusion.","WTCOMTDM101.pdf","European, Union, Members, EU, EU, CTD, Members, Members"
"268",268,"144","144. The representative of South Africa expressed support for the intervention by the African Group. She noted that the proposals under consideration had been submitted in line with paragraph 1.1. of the 1998 Work Programme and paragraph 1 of the Nairobi Decision on e - commerce. She also recalled that, according to the Work Programme, the CTD was to examine and report on the development implications of electronic commerce, taking into account the economic, financial and development needs of developing countries. Pointing to the digital divide and the uneven growth of e-commerce, she believed that the proposals needed to be refined and narrowed down in order to ensure a pertinent discussion in the CTD, as per the Work Programme. Her delegation believed that a number of specific issues needed to be taken up for further examination. These included: (i) the challenges that developing countries faced in becoming e - commerce ready; (ii) measurement challenges relating to e-commerce and the need for                                          WT/COMTD/M/101                                                - 28 - accurate data to engage in evidence-based policymaking; (iii) building the capabilities of developing countries and LDCs to participate in cross-border e-commerce; and (iv) the impact of e-commerce on Africa’s developmental objectives of industrial development, structural transformation and employment – with a view to promoting trade, development, and inclusive and equitable growth in the digital economy. She believed that South Africa could learn from other Members that had successfully developed their capabilities in the digital economy. Her delegation was particularly interested in specific government measures that had been used to support the development of e-commerce and the digital economy, and in this regard believed that there was potential in establishing strong links between industrial policy, infrastructure and skills development. Her delegation also wished to learn more about issues such as tax avoidance, market concentration, anti-competitive practices and the possible impact on labour conditions, employment and industrial development.","WTCOMTDM101.pdf","South, Africa, African, Group, Nairobi, Work, Programme, CTD, CTD, Work, Programme, LDCs, Africa, South, Africa, Members"
"269",269,"145","145. The representative of Egypt supported the intervention by South Africa, on behalf of the African Group. While noting the interest of many Members to move forward with discussions on e - commerce, his delegation believed that it was premature to draw conclusions on the implications of e-commerce for development and poverty alleviation. His delegation also wished to see engagement by Members in other areas of work in the WTO, including with respect to S&D and agriculture. He went on to outline four main challenges facing developing countries and LDCs in the e-commerce area, which were: (i) insufficient infrastructure; (ii) the lack of technology transfer; (iii) the lack of regulatory frameworks; and (iv) the absence of a multilateral understanding on e-commerce. He noted that the CTD's mandate under the 1998 Work Programme was to examine and report on the development implications of e-commerce, taking into account the economic, financial and development needs of developing countries. In this regard, he suggested that the best way to proceed with discussions on e-commerce would be to tackle the most important problems first, including with respect to issues relating to infrastructure and technology transfer. In closing, he noted that some of the proposals under consideration included elements which were outside the scope of the 1998 Work Programme, for example with regard to e-procurement. He invited the proponents to refine their proposals in order to make them compatible with the Work Programme.","WTCOMTDM101.pdf","Egypt, South, Africa, African, Group, Members, Members, WTO, S&D, LDCs, CTD, Work, Programme"

He said that, although e-commerce was on a rising trend across the world, the evidence showed that the big players were located in Europe, North America and in the Asia-Pacific region. This meant that e - commerce had grown unevenly across the world. He elaborated on several challenges that developing countries faced in making use of e-commerce, including with respect to connectivity, manufacturing capacity and the development of the services sector. He also outlined the problems associated with defining what was an electronic transmission, and in this regard indicated that, until a clear definition was found, it would be difficult to consider making permanent the moratorium on customs duties. He also believed that it was premature to consider developing new rules on e-commerce, given that there were still many issues relating to e-commerce that needed to be clarified.","WTCOMTDM101.pdf","Rwanda, South, Africa, Cameroon, Uganda, Egypt, India, Europe, North, America, Asia-Pacific"

He emphasized the need for future discussions on e-commerce to be focused and informed. In this regard, he believed that it was important to make clear the boundaries of the WTOs' work on e-commerce relative to the work of other organizations, and to ensure that discussions in the WTO took place within the framework of the 1998 Work Programme.

The representative of Nigeria welcomed the opportunity for Members to have a strategic discussion on the future of the WTO's TA, and suggested that further discussions would also be useful. He indicated that there were a number of areas in the report on which he was seeking clarification and further elaboration from the consultants. The first area concerned the mention in the report that some divisions within the Secretariat continued to implement informal and uncoordinated TA activities, which made the Organization's total effort less purposeful and accountable. The second area on which he sought clarification referred to the observation in the report that, while training and internship programmes were found to be highly relevant, the overall relevance of the WTO's TA activities beyond these programmes was far less clear. The third area concerned the issue of efficiency, and in particular the report's finding that the way TA was governed and managed within the Organization reduced its potential efficiency. The fourth area related to the issue of sustainability, and in particular the observation in the report that, if the main budgetary and extra-budgetary resources were seriously weakened or made less cohesive, the WTO's technical support capacity would no longer be sustainable. Finally, he expressed support for the suggestion by Norway, on behalf of the Steering Committee of the evaluation, for the establishment of an implementation support group.","WTCOMTDM101.pdf","Nigeria, Members, WTO, Secretariat, WTO, WTO, Norway, Steering, Committee"

The Chairman said that he wished to provide Members with a brief update on the preferential trade arrangements (PTAs) that were to be considered in Dedicated Sessions of the CTD. He firstly informed the Committee that a new notification had been made under the Transparency Mechanism for PTAs since the last CTD meeting. This concerned the US' trade preferences for Nepal. The notification, of 20 January 2017, was circulated in document WT/COMTD/N/52. The Secretariat would be able to begin the preparation of the factual presentation on this PTA after the US submitted its 2017 tariff schedule for integration into the Integrated Database. Turning to the other PTAs to be considered in Dedicated Sessions, he said that the Secretariat had still not received the full set of data or information required for the preparation of the factual presentations on the PTAs being implemented by China, India, the Russian Federation, Chinese Taipei and Thailand. He urged these Members to provide the necessary data and information as soon as possible.","WTCOMTDM101.pdf","Chairman, Members, CTD, Committee, US, Nepal, Secretariat, PTA, US, Integrated, Database, Secretariat, China, India, Russian, Federation, Taipei, Thailand, Members"

He informed the Committee in this regard that China, as a developing Member, had been providing 97% DFQF access since 2015. It was hoped that this would help LDCs to fully achieve their trade potential, while promoting economic growth and sustainable development. With a view to increasing transparency in China's DFQF scheme, his delegation had circulated a notification in November 2016, providing updated information on the scheme. His delegation was also working to provide to the Secretariat the required data relating to scheme. In closing, he urged Members, and especially developed Members, to fulfil their obligations by providing increasingly greater DFQF market access to LDCs.","WTCOMTDM101.pdf","China, Committee, China, Member, China, Secretariat, Members, Members"

"279",279,"154","154. The representative of Cambodia, on behalf of the LDC Group, recalled that the Group had circulated in November 2016 a revised proposal containing the draft terms of reference for a clinical examination of DFQF implementation. The revised proposal, which was contained in document WT/COMTD/W/218/Rev.1, had been introduced by the delegation of Benin at the last CTD meeting. Although the LDC Group had since held consultations with the key delegations that had expressed concerns, some Members were still sceptical about the clinical examination. With regard to the first section of the proposal, one Member had observed that the reference to the Hong Kong DFQF Decision was prejudicial to its position on the Doha Development Agenda (DDA), and had suggested that the reference could be omitted. This suggestion posed difficulties for the LDC Group, as it eroded the foundational basis of the proposal. Furthermore, it had systemic implications for everything anchored in the DDA architecture that the LDCs had pursued, and continued to pursue. She explained that the reference to the Hong Kong Decision provided a historical background, and had not been made in relation to future work on DFQF. With regard to the second section of the proposal, which addressed the scope and parameters of the clinical examination, she said that one Member had felt affected. After several consultations with this Member, the LDC Group had decided to make the parameters neutral, as laid out in the revised proposal. She additionally informed the Committee that no comments had been made on the third section of the proposal, concerning the approach, while the timetable for the study – contained in the fourth section – had been rearranged. She went on to say that the LDC Group had demonstrated flexibility, and urged Members to show similar flexibility. It was observed in this regard that the Group was asking for a study, and not a decision. Furthermore, any recommendations from the study would need to be agreed to by consensus. In this light, she called on Members to agree to the terms of reference for the clinical examination.

With respect to the revised proposal, he explained that it had not been possible to accommodate all the requests made by delegations during the consultations. In particular, the Group had decided to maintain the reference to the Hong Kong Decision, as it was felt that this Decision provided the appropriate background and mandate. Furthermore, it had systemic implications for all LDC specific issues, including cotton, preferential rules of origin and the services waiver. He questioned the suggestion that no references could be made to the DDA, noting in particular that this had further implications, for example with respect to the implementation of the Ministerial Decisions from the Bali and Nairobi Ministerial Conferences. He also observed that the proposed clinical examination was not about the future, but rather about how DFQF had been implemented in the past.

"281",281,"156","156. The representative of the United States recalled that, in past meetings, her delegation had reported the expansion of DFQF benefits for LDCs under the US' Generalized System of Preferences scheme, as well as under the African Growth and Opportunity Act. She also informed the Committee that, on 30 December 2016, the US had begun implementing a new set of preferential trade benefits for Nepal. These benefits were in addition to the benefits already provided under the GSP scheme. The preferences, which were developed in response to the devastating earthquake in 2015, provided duty-free treatment for 66 tariff lines. The covered goods were classified in Chapters 42, 57, 61, 62, 63, and 65 of the Harmonized System. A link to the full list of covered products could be found in the US' notification of the preference programme. These improvements demonstrated that the US had faithfully implemented the Bali Decision to improve existing DFQF coverage for products originating from LDCs, so as to provide increasingly greater market access to LDCs. As Members were aware, the US' preference programmes for LDCs were authorized by the US Congress. She additionally noted that reference had been made at the present meeting to the LDC Group's proposal on the terms of reference for a clinical examination of DFQF implementation. In this regard, she recalled that her delegation had previously raised concerns on the proposal, including the revised version considered at the last CTD meeting. In closing, she indicated that her delegation looked forward to continuing to work with the LDCs to determine whether a way forward on this issue might be possible.","WTCOMTDM101.pdf","United, States, LDCs, US, Committee, US, Nepal, GSP, US, US, Bali, Members, US, LDCs, US, Congress, LDC, Group, LDCs"

She said that any terms of reference for a Secretariat study needed to be objective and allow for a factual examination of DFQF market access for LDCs.

The representative of Oman said that collaboration between the WTO and academia had been fruitful in Oman in recent years, in particular as the Regional Trade Policy Course (RTPC) for the Arab region had been hosted by Sultan Qaboos University since 2014. He indicated that the feedback received from the RTPCs had been positive. Oman had also been hosting the WTO Chairs since 2014. He went on to say that the provision of TA in Arabic was an important issue for the region. A solution needed to be found to the absence of Arabic in the WTO. In this context, he reiterated the request that e-learning be provided in Arabic, as a small step towards reaching out to Arab stakeholders.

He informed the Committee that some consultations had been held in this regard, and the name that had emerged was that of the incoming Ambassador of the Netherlands, Ms. Monique van Daalen. However, given the current situation regarding the slate of names, it was his understanding that a number of delegations preferred waiting for the overall situation to be unblocked before the CTD formally elected the new Chairperson of the Sub-Committee.

With regard to the non-training TA programmes, she expressed concern that, for some of these programmes, the information gathered for the evaluation had not been substantial. She regretted in particular that a separate assessment had not been made of the effectiveness of the academic outreach programme, which her delegation believed was a valuable programme, with tangible effects. In this regard, she elaborated on the benefits of the WTO Chairs programme, as well as the European Law Students' Association (ELSA) Moot Court competitions. She asked whether the evaluators could share information on what their concrete recommendations would be, and their suggestions for gathering information on the impact of these                                          WT/COMTD/M/101                                                 -6- programmes. Her delegation, as Coordinator of the Group of Small, Vulnerable Economies, had also seen the importance of the Geneva Week activity for delegations without representation in Geneva, and wished to know if the evaluators had any concrete recommendations for this activity as well. With regard to recommendation 7 in the report, she indicated that her delegation did not agree with the suggestion to have a coordinating centre for TA. Her delegation's experience was such that such centres often sent out communications in a disorganized manner, which resulted in confusion. During meetings with the evaluators, her delegation had highlighted the importance of improving communication by using the existing channels, including in particular the missions in Geneva. Finally, referring to recommendation 23, she recognized the problems faced by the Secretariat in filling the quotas for certain courses. In this regard, she suggested that, rather than increasing the number of courses offered in Spanish or French only, consideration could be given to providing translations of all the English courses – or at least those courses offered at the expert level.","WTCOMTDM101.pdf","Guatemala, WTO, WTO, European, Law, Students, ', Association, ELSA, Moot, Court, Vulnerable, Economies, Geneva, Geneva, Secretariat"

He noted that, in addition to the significant contributions made by individual EU member States, the EU had donated approximately EUR 20 million – over CHF 21 million – to WTO trust funds over the past 15 years. Contributions by the EU and its member States represented more than two thirds of the contributions to the DDAGTF. Turning to the evaluation report and its recommendations, he expressed satisfaction that the WTO's TA had proven to be effective overall. He also noted that there were areas where the added value was not clear, or where the means used to achieve the end were possibly not the most effective ones. He believed that, when discussing the TA Plan for the 2018-2019 period, Members would need to consider the improvements that were needed, including in the context of how resources could be better targeted. With regard to the call from the evaluation team for TA to be better integrated into the culture and management practice of the WTO, he believed that the Director-General's presence provided a clear signal that this was also a high priority for WTO management. While appreciating the actions already undertaken by the Secretariat to respond to some of the recommendations, he stressed that the success of TA activities also depended on the efforts of Members, and in this regard called on beneficiaries to intensify their involvement. He also highlighted the importance that his delegation attached to gender equality. In this regard, he supported the management response to recommendation 19, and called upon Members to present concrete proposals to help address gender imbalances. In closing, he called for the implementation of the recommendations on the basis of the management response, in dialogue with Members, and for the preparation of regular progress reports. He also supported the suggestion by Norway, on behalf of the Steering Committee of the evaluation, to put in place an implementation support group.","WTCOMTDM101.pdf","European, Union, WTO, EU, States, EU, WTO, EU, States, WTO, Members, WTO, Director-General, WTO, Secretariat, Members, Members, Members, Norway, Steering, Committee"

He also welcomed the Secretariat's efforts in reviewing the TA activities and working towards a language balance. Noting that a number of elements had not been addressed by Saana Consulting when preparing the evaluation, he suggested that the terms of reference for the evaluation needed to be updated.

He recalled that, at the Geneva Week held in December 2016, the ITTC had presented some of the findings of the evaluation, and his delegation had expressed concern that Geneva Week beneficiaries had not been consulted during the evaluation process. Nevertheless, he was encouraged to note from paragraph 17 of the management response that further analysis was required on issues relating to Geneva Week. In closing, he shared his view that Members needed to consider how the recommendations from the evaluation would be implemented.","WTCOMTDM101.pdf","Vanuatu, Geneva, Week, Member, ITTC, Geneva, Week, Geneva, Week, Members"
"306",306,"24","24.    The representative of the United States indicated her delegation's satisfaction with the overall assessment that the impact of the WTO's TA activities was positive. She noted from the WTO management response that action was already being taken to address a number of recommendations, including with respect to gender imbalances. However, in some areas, she believed that greater specificity in the management response would have been helpful. For example, in the case of recommendation 13, the WTO management had responded that the e-learning staff capacity had been reinforced, but no further details were provided. Turning to recommendation 17, which proposed the consideration of alternative approaches to the WTO reference centres, she asked if the Secretariat could give a more concrete sense of the timelines for the reviews that were to be undertaken, and also provide information on any other planned actions. Highlighting the importance of an effective RBM system, she indicated that her delegation looked forward to updates on the Secretariat's progress in implementing the management response to recommendation 26, including in the context of a comprehensive evaluation of RBM tools and business processes. With regard to recommendation 5 and the importance of senior leadership engagement, her delegation believed that there was scope to strengthen the strategic management mechanism, and looked forward to learning more about the Director-General's vision for this. She also referred to recommendation 28, and encouraged the Secretariat to explore effective ways to increase Members' participation, particularly in the context of feedback from beneficiaries. In closing, she shared her delegation's view that the management response could have been strengthened by inserting boxes for each recommendation, which would help track progress with regard to the means of verification and the status of completion. Finally, she supported the recommendation made by Norway, on behalf of the Steering Committee of the evaluation, for the establishment of an implementation support group.","WTCOMTDM101.pdf","United, States, WTO, WTO, WTO, WTO, Secretariat, RBM, Secretariat, RBM, Director-General, Secretariat, Members, Norway, Steering, Committee"

He welcomed the positive impact of the WTO's TA activities, and also expressed appreciation for the Secretariat's efforts to improve the effectiveness and operation of these activities through an RBM approach. He took note of the areas identified in the evaluation report where further improvement would be needed, and encouraged open and frank discussions on the way forward. Turning to some specific areas of the WTO's TA, he indicated that careful consideration might be needed on the future of the reference centres, given the rapid and significant advance in TA delivery methods such as e-learning. In addition, while acknowledging the merit of regional or topic-oriented programmes, his delegation wished to know beneficiaries' views on activities such as the Advanced Trade Policy Course (ATPC), which was an effective approach to foster the skills of trade officials dealing with complex, cross-cutting issues. He also indicated that his delegation welcomed further efforts by the Secretariat in terms of the expansion of self-funded participation and gender equality, but also expressed concern with regard to the high amount of carry-overs in the DDAGTF, and requested the Secretariat to make further efforts for the appropriate and efficient implementation of TA activities within available resources. Finally, he expressed his delegation's support for the proposal by Norway, on behalf of the Steering Committee of the evaluation, for the establishment of an implementation support group.","WTCOMTDM101.pdf","Japan, WTO, Secretariat, RBM, WTO, ATPC, Secretariat, Secretariat, Norway, Steering, Committee"

The representative of Montenegro expressed particular appreciation for the gender dimension of the recommendations, and invited the Secretariat to use every opportunity to strengthen the gender balance in the WTO's TA activities. She indicated that the TA provided to Montenegro was in line with its priority areas, which included activities relating to the Government Procurement Agreement, the Trade Facilitation Agreement, e-commerce and notifications in agriculture, as well as participation in the Young Professionals Programme. Noting the importance of ensuring a more efficient and effective use of resources, she asked whether it would be possible for the Secretariat to develop a system to track all the TA provided annually by the WTO to each beneficiary. She believed that this would allow delegations from beneficiary countries to better                                          WT/COMTD/M/101                                                  -8- demonstrate to their Governments the WTO's contribution to trade-related TA, and thereby ensure more effective collaboration with the Secretariat on TA issues.","WTCOMTDM101.pdf","Montenegro, Secretariat, WTO, Montenegro, Secretariat, WTO, WTO, Secretariat"

He emphasized the importance of the WTO's TA, and elaborated in particular on the benefits of the assistance provided to the member countries of the Economic Community of West African States. He believed that, to the extent possible, courses needed to be organized in all WTO languages.

He elaborated on the manner in which trade officials in Sri Lanka were able to benefit from the knowledge gained during WTO TA activities, and suggested that a record of participants in TA activities be maintained by the Secretariat, as this would help in determining which individuals were suitable for participation in more advanced activities. He also believed that it would be useful for TPRs to include a description of the benefits of TA to individual Members.","WTCOMTDM101.pdf","Sri, Lanka, WTO, Sri, Lanka, WTO, Secretariat, Members"

"314",314,"31","31.     The response by Saana Consulting touched upon several points. The coverage of the evaluation was elaborated on, and it was observed in this regard that the implementation by some divisions of informal TA activities made it more difficult to have an overall strategic approach. On the question of efficiency, it was noted that this was also related to the need for management involvement, including through the provision of strategic direction. Furthermore, strengthened mechanisms at senior management level had to be backed up by an inter-divisional task force, as laid out in recommendation 5. On the issue of sustainability, Members were referred to recommendation 2. The view was reiterated that the WTO's TA capacity would not be sustainable if the main budgetary and extra-budgetary resources were seriously weakened. It was additionally clarified that the evaluators had been in a position to provide assessments not only of the training and internship programmes, but of the non-training activities as well. For example, paragraph 6 of the report noted with regard to awareness-raising that the evaluation had not been able to trace or measure significant evidence of effects. The evaluation had also found that the overall strategic objectives of academic support and the WTO Chairs programme were unclear, although there was some evidence of longer-term benefits from support to the ELSA Moot Court. No significant evidence on the role or effectiveness of outreach activities to parliamentarians, journalists and civil society had been found, and the evaluation had additionally suggested that alternative approaches to the WTO reference centres needed to be considered.","WTCOMTDM101.pdf","Saana, Consulting, Members, WTO, WTO, ELSA, Moot, Court, WTO"
"315",315,"32","32.    In the context of non-training activities, questions relating to Geneva Week and the input of non-residents in the evaluation were addressed. It was clarified that, while the non-residents had not been consulted in Geneva – and were not among those selected for the field missions – questionnaires had been sent to all beneficiary countries, as well as to past participants in TA activities. That being said, the evaluation had found that the aims of Geneva Week were not clearly stated. Similarly, the role and effectiveness of the ATPCs was unclear. On the question of how to ensure gender balance when the proportion of men and women varied from country-to-country, it was explained that the evaluators had framed the question in terms of the available pool, which was a way to account for differences across countries. In spite of the Secretariat's efforts, there remained significant gaps in terms of gender participation in TA activities. Finally, it was explained that the recommendation to organize workshops on issues regarding which agreements were yet to be concluded had its roots in the suggestion that such workshops would help to prepare beneficiaries for multilateral discussions on these issues.

"316",316,"33","33.    Interventions by representatives of the Institute for Training and Technical Cooperation addressed several areas. Members were informed that a record of all participants in TA activities was maintained, and that the Secretariat's regular reports on TA implementation and monitoring included coverage of the activities which had not been fully addressed by the evaluation. With regard to the suggestion to form an implementation support group, it was indicated that such a mechanism could allow the Secretariat to report in more detail to Members, and would also help to take forward the recommendations from the evaluation. On the issue of gender balance, the need for beneficiary countries to nominate more female participants was highlighted. The request from some delegations for further opportunities to discuss the results of the evaluation was noted, although the presence of Saana Consulting at a future meeting would depend on the terms of its contract. It was observed that the way forward with respect to the evaluation and its findings was in Members' hands. With respect to the non-training activities, it was explained that these had been established in response to some Members' requests. The Secretariat was willing to consult with Members on these activities, including in the context of possibly defining clearer objectives. It was recalled that some TPRs had in the past included assessments of TA, and consideration could be given to restart that practice, if there was demand from Members. Finally, with regard to the requests for the provision of TA in Arabic, an overview was provided of some the issues involved, including with respect to resources, partnerships with other institutions, and the need to develop an agreed glossary of WTO terminology in Arabic. The Secretariat would continue its consultations with the Arab Group on this matter.","WTCOMTDM101.pdf","Institute, for, Training, and, Technical, Cooperation, Members, Secretariat, Secretariat, Members, Saana, Consulting, Members, Members, Secretariat, Members, Members, WTO, Secretariat, Arab, Group"

The Chairman recalled that, at the Eighth Ministerial Conference (MC8), Ministers had, inter alia, reaffirmed the positive link between trade and development and called for focused work in the CTD. Ministers had called on Members to fully operationalize the mandate of the CTD as a focal point for development work. On the agenda for the present meeting were two submissions containing proposals for work under the MC8 mandate. He recalled that, at the 100 th Session, he had welcomed the indication that Members were holding informal discussions to try and make progress on these proposals, and he had encouraged further engagement.

He informed the Committee that consultations on the proposals were still ongoing. It was hoped that convergence could be reached soon. He emphasized that the proponents did not have the objective of usurping the mandate of the General Council, as some delegations may have felt. Rather, the aim was to fulfil the instructions of Ministers at MC8 to fully operationalize the mandate of the CTD. Recalling that the CTD had been established to serve as a focal point for the consideration and coordination of development-related work in the WTO, he noted that the current reporting structure between WTO bodies fell short of appropriately fulfilling the CTD's overarching mandate. He explained in this regard that relevant decisions taken by other WTO bodies were not being regularly reported to the CTD, nor had the CTD been consulted on a range of development-related issues that had been taken up by these bodies.","WTCOMTDM101.pdf","Cameroon, African, Group, Committee, General, Council, CTD, CTD, WTO, WTO, CTD, WTO, CTD, CTD"
"328",328,"44","44.    In order to operationalize the CTD's mandate, he suggested that other WTO bodies could submit a brief report on the development-related aspects of their work. He went on to provide some examples of the type of information that could be provided to the CTD, including with respect to S&D, the development impact of the elimination of trade-related investment measures, the development impact of the operationalization of the LDC services waiver, information relating to the implementation of Articles 66.1 and 66.2 of the TRIPS Agreement, and information relating to the work of negotiating bodies such as the Negotiating Group on Market Access and the Special Session of the Committee on Agriculture. The Secretariat could then put the various reports together into a single document, which would be discussed in the Committee. The CTD would also be able to provide guidance and appropriate recommendations to the General Council and other WTO bodies on any development-related work. This would better link development to trade in a manner that would contribute to the economic development of the WTO’s developing, least developed, and small and vulnerable constituencies. The compilation document would additionally help to address the capacity constraints of many delegations that were not able to participate in all the meetings of WTO bodies. In closing, he emphasized once again the importance of improving intra-reporting procedures and operationalizing the CTD’s mandate by periodically reviewing the development-related work taking place in other WTO bodies.","WTCOMTDM101.pdf","CTD, WTO, CTD, Committee, on, Agriculture, Secretariat, Committee, CTD, General, Council, WTO, WTO, WTO, CTD, WTO"

She recalled that the EU had engaged constructively in the discussion that had led to agreement on the proposal for the Secretariat to prepare an update of its document on the implementation of S&D provisions in the WTO Agreements and Decisions.

Nevertheless, her delegation was willing to engage in informal discussions to make progress. With regard to the issues raised in the proposal contained in document WT/COMTD/W/192, she said that the EU was looking for a pragmatic solution.

"347",347,"61","61.    Turning to the listed sub-items under the present agenda item, the Chairman said that he wished to say a few words on the first three sub-items. He observed that these sub-items had been appearing on the CTD's agenda for several years. Many CTD Chairpersons had held consultations in order to try and find a way forward, but the situation remained essentially the same. He added that, during his tenure as CTD Chairman, these issues had come up in his conversations on RTA-related issues with the Chairman of the CRTA, and the Chairman of the Negotiating Group on Rules (NGR). He had also had the opportunity to discuss the matter with several delegations. Among some of the possible suggestions on ways forward that he had heard – at least with respect to some of the RTAs in question – were suggestions relating to possible joint meetings of the CTD and the CRTA, or otherwise back-to-back meetings. It had also been suggested that discussions on a way forward be held in the context of paragraph 28 of the Nairobi Declaration. He invited Members to consider these observations, and encouraged continued engagement in order to find a way forward.       -     Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) Notification of Customs Union – communication from             China, Egypt and India (WT/COMTD/W/175)","WTCOMTDM101.pdf","Chairman, CTD, CTD, Chairman, Chairman, CRTA, Chairman, CTD, CRTA, Members, Gulf, Cooperation, Council, GCC, -RRB-, Notification, of, Customs, Union, China, Egypt, India"

"349",349,"63","63.    The representative of India indicated that his intervention related to the three sub-items under the present agenda item, since the three RTAs referenced in these sub-items had been ""dually notified"" under both the Enabling Clause and GATT Article XXIV. He noted that the systemic concerns that were raised by China, Egypt and India over the legal and procedural implications of the dual notification of the GCC Customs Union under both the Enabling Clause and GATT Article XXIV were pertinent even now, but they remained unaddressed. Some Members had                                          WT/COMTD/M/101                                                - 13 - expressed the view that the systemic concerns raised in document WT/COMTD/W/175 were outside the scope of the CTD, and needed to be discussed in the NGR. The view of his delegation was that the CTD was the appropriate forum to consider the questions arising from RTAs with a dual notification. Pointing to the terms of reference of the CTD contained in document WT/L/46, he noted that the CTD was designated to serve as a focal point for consideration and coordination of work on development in the WTO and its relationship to development-related activities in other multilateral agencies. He added that the Committee could consult with other WTO bodies in addressing the systemic concerns raised in document WT/COMTD/W/175. This was in keeping with paragraph 3 of the CTD's terms of reference which entrusted the Committee to review periodically, in consultation as appropriate with the relevant bodies of the WTO, the application of special provisions in the Multilateral Trade Agreements and related Ministerial Decisions in favour of developing country Members, and in particular LDC Members, and report to the General Council for appropriate action. In concluding, he indicated that the three sub-items under the present agenda item needed to remain on the CTD's agenda until the systemic and specific concerns arising from ""dually notified"" RTAs were addressed.","WTCOMTDM101.pdf","GATT, China, Egypt, India, GCC, Customs, Union, GATT, Members, CTD, CTD, CTD, CTD, WTO, Committee, WTO, CTD, Committee, WTO, Members, Members, General, Council, CTD"

The representative of the United States asked whether India was aware that the GCC Customs Union had been notified under GATT Article XXIV, and was on track to be reviewed in the CRTA. He added that the GCC Customs Union had never been a case of dual notification, and in this light asked India for clarification on its position.","WTCOMTDM101.pdf","United, States, India, GCC, Customs, Union, GATT, CRTA, GCC, Customs, Union, India"
"351",351,"65","65.    The representative of the European Union believed that the legal and procedural questions arising from RTAs being notified under different legal provisions needed to be clarified. She called for a pragmatic solution for the notifications in question, and indicated that any substantive discussion had to take place in the framework of the implementation of paragraph 28 of Nairobi Declaration. However, she noted that a clear distinction needed to be made between the ASEAN-Korea and India-Korea agreements on the one hand, and the GCC Customs Union on the other. With regard to the ASEAN-Korea and India-Korea agreements, she regretted that the parties had been unable to find a solution, although she appreciated the willingness demonstrated by Korea to make progress. She went on to say that the GCC Customs Union notification was a different case. As had been stated in previous meetings, the EU's position was that a custom union could not be notified under the Enabling Clause, and that GATT Article XXIV was the only legal basis for the notification of custom unions. She supported the US in noting that the GCC Customs Union had been notified under GATT Article XXIV, and was in the pipeline to be reviewed in the CRTA. Furthermore, the GCC Customs Union was not an issue of dual notification. The fact that the GCC parties had not as yet withdrawn their notification under the Enabling Clause created doubts regarding the possibility of maintaining notifications under two different legal provisions. Her delegation urged the GCC parties to withdraw their notification under the Enabling Clause. In closing, she reiterated her delegation’s willingness to find a solution.","WTCOMTDM101.pdf","European, Union, India-Korea, GCC, Customs, Union, India-Korea, Korea, GCC, Customs, Union, EU, GATT, US, GCC, Customs, Union, GATT, CRTA, GCC, Customs, Union, GCC, GCC"

He went on to say that he also wished to repeat the points made by his delegation in previous meetings with regard to the second and third sub-items under the present agenda item. These sub-items had fulfilled their purpose of informing Members of the notifications made, and needed to be removed from the agenda. With respect to the issue of dual notifications, he indicated that this was directly linked to the functioning of the Transparency Mechanism for RTAs and went beyond the mandate of the CTD. The US was willing to discuss the functioning of the RTA Transparency Mechanism in the CRTA. He also indicated it was up to each individual member to decide how to notify its RTAs, and that a Member should not be pressured to notify its agreements in a particular way.

She added that 16 Individual Notification Datasheets were annexed to the document – one for each of the agreements concluded under the TM80 over the period 1 January 2015 – 31 December 2015. These Individual Notification Datasheets were drawn up and approved by the LAIA member countries that signed the concerned agreements, in accordance with the format provided in document WT/REG/16 of 23 November 2006. The signatories of these agreements were ready to supplement in a dedicated session of the CTD the information contained in the various Individual Notification Datasheets with respect to any particular aspect of the agreements, in accordance with paragraphs 16 and 18 of the Transparency Mechanism for RTAs.","WTCOMTDM101.pdf","Uruguay, WTO, Members, LAIA, CTD, CRTA, WTO, Montevideo, GATT/WTO, LAIA"

"365",365,"78","78.   The representative of the United States said that his delegation had concerns with the LAIA report being listed under the present agenda item. While some improvements had been made in the presentation of the latest report relative to previous ones, discussions needed to continue in order to determine whether the submission was intended to be a notification. He referred to a room document circulated by the Secretariat in the CRTA, which showed that there were 97 separate LAIA agreements in force. While some of these had been notified to the WTO, most had not. The notification of the TM80 was not sufficient, since the treaty itself made clear that the agreements entered into under it were not modifications to the umbrella agreement, but were separate agreements. The TM80 provided for regional and partial scope agreements, but did not say anything about the specific treatment to be given to a product or class of products by any signatory. In that respect, the new submission was not sufficient in terms of a notification, and could not fulfil the obligations of individual Members. Noting that the document contained                                         WT/COMTD/M/101                                                - 15 - information on an agreement to which Uruguay was not a party, he inquired whether Members' questions on this agreement should be directed to Uruguay, or to the parties to the agreement. He further noted that footnote 1 of the document made reference to notifications within previous LAIA reports, and sought clarification on which notifications were being referred to. He asked if Uruguay was making the claim that previous LAIA reports should be considered as notifications to the WTO for the purposes of the Transparency Mechanism for RTAs. In this regard, he stressed that no notifications of the agreements in question had been circulated. His delegation welcomed a discussion on how the information contained in the LAIA reports could be translated into WTO notifications. However, continued assertions that the LAIA reports had a status as an alternate form of notification was not a productive way forward.","WTCOMTDM101.pdf","United, States, LAIA, Secretariat, CRTA, WTO, Members, Uruguay, Members, Uruguay, LAIA, Uruguay, LAIA, WTO, LAIA, WTO, LAIA"
"366",366,"79","79.    The representative of the European Union indicated that, while her delegation had taken note of the information contained in the LAIA submission, it was unclear at this stage whether the document was just a report, or whether it could be considered a set of notifications. She recalled that, in September 2016, her delegation had submitted written questions to the LAIA countries, which were circulated in the CRTA in document WT/REG/W/109. She urged the LAIA countries to provide responses as soon as possible, as this would facilitate a constructive dialogue. Until the replies were received, the EU would reserve its right to comment on the new LAIA report.","WTCOMTDM101.pdf","European, Union, CRTA, LAIA, EU, LAIA"

During the evaluation process, regular updates were provided to the CTD by Norway, on behalf of the Steering Committee of the evaluation. As per the terms of reference for the evaluation, the final evaluation report, together with the WTO management response, were to be presented and discussed in the CTD. The final report of the external evaluation was contained in document WT/COMTD/89, while the management response was contained in document WT/COMTD/90.

However, it still did not meet the expected standards for review, and as a result his delegation could not consider it a notification.

This communication, from the Chairperson of the LAIA Committee of Representatives, was addressed to the CTD Chairman. He recalled that a lengthy discussion had taken place on the basis of the communication – which was circulated in document WT/COMTD/W/220 – and he had encouraged Members to continue to discuss the issues relating to the LAIA agreements, with a view to finding a way forward. He had also taken note of the request from several LAIA member countries for a written response. For transparency purposes, his response of 24 February 2017 to the Chairperson of the LAIA Committee of Representatives was circulated in document WT/COMTD/W/223.","WTCOMTDM101.pdf","Chairman, Committee, Uruguay, LAIA, Chairperson, LAIA, Committee, of, Representatives, CTD, Chairman, Members, LAIA, LAIA, Chairperson, LAIA, Committee, of, Representatives"
"373",373,"85","85.    The representative of Brazil regretted that the Chairman's response did not address the central issue of the notification of LAIA agreements to the CTD. These notifications had been submitted to the CTD on a biennial basis until 2012, and annually thereafter. He said that document WT/COMTD/W/217 included a complete notification list, with document symbols, of all LAIA agreements. He also expressed surprise with the Chairman's indication that, because there was no consensus, the latest LAIA submission could not be circulated as a notification document. His delegation believed that this was a misinterpretation of WTO disciplines which could have systemic consequences. In the whole WTO body of rules and regulations, there was no provision that indicated that consensus was needed for Members to notify elements of their trade policies and measures. While the content of a notification could be challenged, consensus was not required                                          WT/COMTD/M/101                                                 - 16 - for a notification to be filed. He went on to say that neither the 1979 Understanding on Notifications, adopted at the end of the Tokyo Round, nor the Uruguay Round Decision on Notification Procedures adopted in 1994, contained a reference to a consensus requirement. Both stated clearly that a notification by a Member of a trade measure was without prejudice to views on the consistency of measures with, or their relevance to, rights and obligations under the concerned multilateral trade agreements. He indicated that his delegation was bringing the matter to the attention of the Development Division and the Legal Affairs Division. It was hoped that the Secretariat could confirm the points made by his delegation. If there was a misunderstanding by Members on the scope and requirements of notification procedures, it was important to clarify it once and for all.","WTCOMTDM101.pdf","Brazil, Chairman, CTD, CTD, Chairman, WTO, WTO, Members, Tokyo, Uruguay, Member, Development, Division, Legal, Affairs, Division, Secretariat, Members"
"374",374,"86","86.    He indicated that he wished to turn to the specific case of notifications under the TM80. In this regard, he said that LAIA countries had drafted, approved and submitted to the WTO the Individual Notification Datasheets contained in document WT/COMTD/93, and in previous reports to the CTD. Every datasheet contained the relevant information required in a notification, including the parties to the agreement, the date of signature and entry into force, the description of the instrument, and links to the relevant documents and schedules. The LAIA countries' right to notify agreements falling under the Enabling Clause to the CTD was unquestionable. The ability to do so under section D of the RTA Transparency Mechanism seemed well established. If, as it appeared, other Members saw the matter differently, then discussions could take place. However, it could not be said that the agreements concluded under the TM80 had not been notified, since all necessary information had been duly transmitted. He therefore reiterated the request that the LAIA document be recirculated with the symbol ""WT/COMTD/N/--"", in keeping with notifications made within the CTD framework. In addition, he indicated that the inclusion of these agreements in the list of non-notified RTAs, which was tabled in the CRTA, was objectionable on factual, legal and technical grounds. He explained that LAIA countries fulfilled their notification obligations under the Enabling Clause in the CTD, and not in the CRTA. The LAIA agreements should not be considered in the CRTA, unless there was a national decision by specific LAIA countries to notify their agreements to the CRTA under GATT Article XXIV.","WTCOMTDM101.pdf","LAIA, WTO, Individual, Notification, Datasheets, CTD, CTD, RTA, Members, LAIA, CTD, CRTA, LAIA, CTD, CRTA, CRTA, LAIA, CRTA, GATT"

The representative of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela reiterated the request contained in document WT/COMTD/W/220 for all LAIA agreements to be removed from the list of non - notified RTAs, since all these agreements were notified in an appropriate manner under the Enabling Clause. He also reiterated the request for the LAIA reports to be circulated as notification documents, and in this regard made particular reference to the latest submission contained in document WT/COMTD/93. Finally, he indicated that the issues relating to the notification of the LAIA agreements needed to be addressed within the framework of the CTD, and not in the CRTA.","WTCOMTDM101.pdf","Bolivarian, Republic, of, Venezuela, LAIA, LAIA, CTD, CRTA"
"376",376,"88","88.    The representative of Argentina said that all WTO Members had rights and obligations regarding notifications within the framework of regular Committees. Consensus was not required to submit notifications, although discussions on these notifications could take place after they were circulated. A Committee, or the Secretariat, could not oppose the circulation of a notification. Accordingly, he joined Brazil in requesting that the latest LAIA submission contained in document WT/COMTD/93 be recirculated as a notification.","WTCOMTDM101.pdf","Argentina, WTO, Members, Committee, Secretariat, Brazil, LAIA"

In their presentation, the representatives of Saana Consulting provided a broad overview of the evaluation, including with respect to the objectives, scope, findings and recommendations. It was noted, inter alia, that the objective of the evaluation was to provide an independent assessment of the functioning of the WTO's trade-related TA during the 2010-2015 period. The evaluation was managed by a Steering Committee, consisting of representatives from donor and beneficiary WTO Members. The evaluation team was comprised of consultants from seven countries. Over 2,000 TA activities were covered at the national, regional and global levels, involving about 80,000 participants. The coverage extended to all four TA delivery modes – which included face-to-face courses, e-learning, internships and academic partnerships. The internationally accepted evaluation criteria of relevance, effectiveness, efficiency, impact and sustainability were applied. The focus of the final report of the evaluation was on the management and delivery of the WTO's TA, best practices, lessons learned, and recommendations. The report contained a specific chapter on the contributions of the Doha Development Agenda Global Trust Fund (DDAGTF). The methodology used was centred on a structured and verifiable approach to answering 22 core evaluation questions that were designed to test the relevance, effectiveness, sustainability and impact of the programmes.","WTCOMTDM101.pdf","Saana, Consulting, WTO, Steering, Committee, WTO, Members, WTO, Doha, Development, Agenda, Global, Trust, Fund"
"379",379,"90","90.    The representative of the Unites States asked why the LAIA agreements could not be notified individually, according to the standard procedure for notifications that was used by all other WTO Members. He also pointed to the lack of a unified approach within LAIA, as some LAIA agreements had been notified, while others had not. As LAIA was not a WTO Member, there was no legal basis for a document from LAIA to be accepted as a notification. He stressed that it was the responsibility of each WTO Member to notify its agreements, and to answer questions relating to its agreements. By submitting reports by LAIA, rather than individual notifications, the LAIA countries were denying WTO Members the chance to review the agreements in question, and therefore to benefit from transparency in these agreements.

"380",380,"91","91.    The representative of Australia emphasized the importance of transparency in trade commitments made by individual Members outside of the multilateral trading system. Each individual Member’s RTAs needed to be duly notified and examined by the membership in the appropriate forum, ideally on the basis of factual presentations prepared by the Secretariat. Customs unions and RTAs in services needed to be notified to, and examined in, the CRTA. His delegation disagreed with the LAIA countries’ assertion that the LAIA agreements had been appropriately notified in a manner that fully complied with the objective and purpose of the RTA Transparency Mechanism. He added that the agreements concluded by the LAIA countries under the TM80 had important implications for regional and global trade, and therefore needed to be considered in detail in the relevant WTO bodies. As the TM80 was a political level agreement – and did not even contain a goods schedule – LAIA’s practice of submitting annual reports to the CTD was not sufficient, as this practice had not permitted the LAIA agreements to be reviewed up to the same standards as other agreements. He stressed the importance of conducting appropriate reviews of the LAIA agreements, and called for engagement from the LAIA countries in this regard. He also urged the LAIA countries to provided responses to the questions that the EU had submitted in the CRTA in September 2016.","WTCOMTDM101.pdf","Australia, Members, Member, Secretariat, Customs, CRTA, RTA, Transparency, Mechanism, LAIA, WTO, LAIA, CTD, LAIA, LAIA, LAIA, LAIA, EU, CRTA"

He indicated that it was the LAIA countries that notified these agreements to the WTO under the Enabling Clause, through Uruguay, and it was therefore for the LAIA countries to respond to any questions from Members.","WTCOMTDM101.pdf","Argentina, WTO, Uruguay, LAIA, Members"
"383",383,"94","94.    The Chairman indicated that he wished to clarify elements of his communication to LAIA, as he did not want any misunderstanding. He said that the main point that he had wished to make in his letter was that there was no consensus among WTO Members for LAIA to make a notification to the WTO. He clarified that a WTO Member was certainly within its rights to submit and circulate any document as a notification. Other Members might not agree that this document constituted a correct notification, but that would be a different issue. However, it was for a WTO Member to submit a request for a document to be circulated as a notification. To this extent, a request in a letter from the Chairperson of the LAIA Committee of Representatives was not a sufficient basis to circulate the LAIA reports as notification documents. Turning specifically to the latest LAIA submission contained in document WT/COMTD/93, he explained that the cover letter from Uruguay to the WTO Secretariat referred to the submission as an annual report for 2015, sent by the Secretary General of LAIA. Accordingly, the existing practice with regard to the circulation of the LAIA reports was maintained, as was the existing practice with regard to the placement of these reports on the agenda. He noted however, that Uruguay, as a WTO Member – or indeed any concerned LAIA member country in its capacity as a WTO Member – could circulate any document it wished with a notification symbol, as long as it was made clear in the communication to the WTO Secretariat that a notification was being submitted. The Member or Members needed to also indicate the legal provision under which the notification was being made. He invited a representative of the Legal Affairs Division to make a few remarks.","WTCOMTDM101.pdf","Chairman, WTO, Members, LAIA, WTO, WTO, Member, Members, WTO, Member, Chairperson, LAIA, Committee, of, Representatives, LAIA, LAIA, Uruguay, WTO, Secretariat, LAIA, LAIA, Uruguay, WTO, Member, LAIA, WTO, Member, WTO, Secretariat, Member, Members, Legal, Affairs, Division"
"384",384,"95","95.     The representative of the Legal Affairs Division said that, while a WTO Member could circulate any document it wished as a notification, the instructions to the Secretariat would need to be clear in specifying that the document was being submitted as a notification. The WTO Members which benefitted from the agreement being notified would also need to be specified, as well as the relevant WTO provision under which the notification was being made. She explained that, although the latest LAIA submission mentioned the word ""notification"", the Secretariat could not follow an instruction from LAIA – a non-WTO Member – to circulate the document as a notification. That being said, the same document could be circulated as the notification of any individual Member, if this was clearly specified to the Secretariat by that Member, and the required information for a notification was provided. She also indicated that the Secretariat had been informed in informal discussions that not all LAIA countries were ready to proceed in the same way with regard to notifications. If it was indeed the case that all the LAIA countries wished to circulate the latest submission as a joint notification, or that one LAIA country would make the notification on behalf of all LAIA countries, this needed to be made clear to the Secretariat.

The Chairman recalled that, at the Eighth Ministerial Conference (MC8), Ministers had, inter alia, reaffirmed the positive link between trade and development and called for focused work in the CTD. Ministers had called on Members to fully operationalize the mandate of the CTD as a focal point for development work. On the agenda for the present meeting were two submissions containing proposals for work under the MC8 mandate. He observed that these proposals had been appearing on the CTD's agenda for quite some time now. He also recalled that previous CTD Chairs held informal consultations to try and make progress on these proposals, but the situation had not changed for many years. The previous Chair had encouraged continued engagement among Members, including through informal discussions between the proponents of these proposals and                                          WT/COMTD/M/103                                                 -3- other delegations, so as to move the process forward.

The representative of Uganda, on behalf of the African Group, said that he wished to intervene on the two remaining proposals contained in documents WT/COMTD/W/208 and WT/COMTD/W/192. He recalled the statement delivered by the Group at the 100 th session of the CTD, and informed the Committee that the proponents of these two proposals were looking forward to undertaking further consultations on the proposals among themselves as well as with the most interested delegations. He invited the Chair to facilitate these consultations and hoped that convergence could be reached soon on these proposals. He went on to emphasize that the proponents did not have the objective of usurping the mandate of the General Council, as some delegations may have felt. Rather, the aim was to fulfil the instructions of Ministers at MC8 to fully operationalize the mandate of the CTD. Recalling that the CTD had been established to serve as a focal point for the consideration and coordination of development-related work in the WTO, he noted that the current reporting structure between WTO bodies fell short of appropriately fulfilling the CTD's overarching mandate. He explained in this regard that relevant decisions taken by other WTO bodies were not being regularly reported to the CTD, nor had the CTD been consulted on a range of development-related issues that had been taken up by these bodies.","WTCOMTDM103.pdf","Uganda, African, Group, Group, CTD, Committee, General, Council, CTD, CTD, WTO, WTO, CTD, WTO, CTD, CTD"
"422",422,"13","13.    In order to operationalize the CTD's mandate, he suggested that other WTO bodies could submit a brief report on the development-related aspects of their work. He then provided some examples of the type of information that could be provided to the CTD, including with respect to special and differential treatment (S&D), the development impact of the elimination of trade-related investment measures, the development impact of the operationalization of the least developed countries (LDCs) services waiver, information relating to the implementation of Articles 66.1 and 66.2 of the TRIPS Agreement and information relating to the work of negotiating bodies such as the Special Session of the Committee on Agriculture. The Secretariat could then put the various reports together into a single document, which would be discussed in the Committee. The CTD would also be able to provide guidance and appropriate recommendations to the General Council and other WTO bodies on any development-related work. This would better link development to trade in a manner that would contribute to the economic development of the WTO’s developing, least developed and small and vulnerable constituencies. The compilation document would additionally help to address the capacity constraints of many delegations that were not able to participate in all the meetings of WTO bodies. In closing, he emphasized once again the importance of improving intra-reporting procedures and operationalizing the CTD’s mandate by periodically reviewing the development-related work taking place in other WTO bodies. This would not only further strengthen the centrality of the CTD as well as its role as the focal point for development-related work in the WTO, but it would also accentuate the CTD's purview in considering all development-related activities of other WTO bodies.","WTCOMTDM103.pdf","CTD, WTO, CTD, Committee, on, Agriculture, Secretariat, Committee, CTD, General, Council, WTO, WTO, WTO, CTD, WTO, CTD, WTO, CTD, WTO"

He noted that the Committee had been unable to reach consensus on items that had remained on the agenda for years. He added that the statement delivered by Uganda had shown that the substance of the proposal remained the same. In this light, he suggested that further informal consultations be held to eventually generate additional information that the proponents might use to modify their proposals. His delegation stood ready to work with the proponents if they revised the proposals. Otherwise, the US would not see the value of maintaining the items relating to these proposals on the agenda of future CTD meetings.","WTCOMTDM103.pdf","United, States, CTD, Committee, Uganda, US, CTD"

The first proposal, which was for the Secretariat to prepare an update to its paper on the implementation of S&D provisions in the WTO Agreements and Decisions, had been agreed to by the Committee at its 87 th Session. The updated Secretariat paper was circulated in June 2013 and had appeared on the CTD's agenda for a number of meetings. Since then, there had also been another update of the same paper, which had been circulated in September 2016, in document WT/COMTD/W/219. As for the second proposal, which was for the CTD to report on development work in the WTO, this idea was now being dealt with in the proposal contained in document WT/COMTD/W/208, which had been addressed under the previous sub-item. The remaining proposal in document WT/COMTD/W/192 was for the CTD to make a recommendation for parties to regional trade agreements (RTAs) to submit their notification and information requirements jointly.","WTCOMTDM103.pdf","Chairman, Committee, Secretariat, WTO, Committee, Secretariat, CTD, CTD, WTO, CTD"

He observed that the Transparency Mechanism for RTAs provided for several notifications to be carried out by Members parties to RTAs. In order to avoid misunderstandings and to help ensure a timely consideration of RTAs, and hence the smooth operation of the Transparency Mechanism, it was important for the parties to submit their notification and information requirements jointly. He went on to express the readiness of the proponents to engage in informal consultations with interested Members so as to reach a consensus on this issue. He recalled that, during some previous informal consultations, some Members had suggested that, as two out of the three items contained in document WT/COMTD/W/192 had already been addressed, the proponents should submit a single separate proposal on the only remaining item. In light of this, the proponents were holding consultations in order to submit a revised document by the next CTD meeting.","WTCOMTDM103.pdf","India, Members, Members, Members, CTD"

He indicated that for Egypt's accession to the Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA), the parties had been requested to provide the data for the preparation of the factual presentation by 6 June 2017. Data was only received from Seychelles. Turning to the agreement between the Dominican Republic and Panama, he informed the Committee that the Secretariat had received data and would begin shortly drafting the factual presentation on this agreement. As for the accession of Afghanistan to the South Asian Free Trade Agreement (SAFTA), he noted that the parties had not as yet submitted the data requested by 22 December 2016.

A draft factual presentation was sent on 11 April 2017 and comments, which were requested by 23rd May 2017, had been received from Egypt, Jordan and Morocco but thus far not from Tunisia. The Secretariat was also still waiting to receive clarification on data from Tunisia and Egypt which had been requested by 15 July 2016. Moving to the agreement between the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) and Singapore, the Chairman indicated that although a draft factual presentation had been sent to the parties, the Secretariat was still waiting to receive complete data from the GCC parties, which had been requested by 23 November 2015. He added that only Kuwait had provided data on which clarification had been sought by the Secretariat. Data on preferential tariffs and exceptions to the most-favoured nation (MFN) rates had also not been received from the other GCC parties. In the case of the accession of Rwanda and Burundi to the East African Community (EAC), the Secretariat awaited comments on the draft factual presentation, which were requested by 16 June 2014. For a number of other RTAs – namely, RTAs between India and Nepal, India and Afghanistan, India and Bhutan, and Cuba and El Salvador – the full set of data needed to complete the factual presentations had not been submitted by the parties. He urged the parties to these agreements to provide the data as soon as possible. He went on to say that there remained one RTA notified under the Enabling Clause that had not been ratified by all the parties. This was the Pacific Island Countries Trade Agreement (PICTA). Following the procedures of the Committee on Regional Trade Agreements (CRTA), a factual presentation of an RTA falling in this category would only be drafted after the agreement had been ratified by all the parties. The parties to PICTA were urged to inform the Secretariat as soon as all ratifications were complete.","WTCOMTDM103.pdf","Egypt, Jordan, Morocco, Tunisia, Egypt, Jordan, Morocco, Egypt, Jordan, Morocco, Tunisia, Secretariat, Tunisia, Egypt, Gulf, Cooperation, Council, GCC, Singapore, Chairman, Secretariat, GCC, Kuwait, Secretariat, MFN, GCC, Rwanda, Burundi, EAC, Secretariat, India, Nepal, India, Afghanistan, India, Bhutan, Cuba, El, Salvador, RTA, Pacific, Island, Committee, CRTA, RTA, Secretariat"

The representative of the United States said that the US accorded great importance to the transparency of RTAs, and that the CTD was charged to maintain purview over the agreements notified under the Enabling Clause. However, a number of these agreements had languished for some time. Accordingly, he requested the active engagement of the Chairman, including through in-depth consultations with those parties that were supposed to provide comments on the draft factual presentation and/or the requisite data to prepare the draft factual presentation. The involvement of the Chair in addressing these issues would help identify the challenges that these countries had been facing in supplying the requisite information. It would also help the CTD to make progress on the vast and growing number of agreements that had been notified under the Enabling Clause, but had not yet been reviewed and those that had not been notified but were in force.","WTCOMTDM103.pdf","United, States, US, CTD, Chairman, CTD"

"450",450,"39","39.    The representative of Egypt said that systemic concerns had been raised by some Members, including Egypt, over the legal and procedural implications of the dual notification of the GCC Customs Union under both the Enabling Clause and GATT Article XXIV. He noted that a number of delegations had previously expressed the view that the Enabling Clause did not provide the appropriate legal basis to justify the formation of a customs union involving the reduction or elimination of NTMs. However, others had argued that the non-prescription of criteria or conditions for the elimination of non-tariffs measures (NTMs) did not exclude customs unions among developing countries from the coverage of the Enabling Clause. The view of his delegation was that the CTD was the appropriate forum to consider the questions arising from RTAs with a dual notification. This originated from the CTD's terms of reference, which stipulated that the CTD was the focal point for the consideration and coordination of work on development in the WTO. In addition, paragraph 4 of the terms of reference mandated the CTD to consider any questions with regard to either the application or the use of special provisions in the Multilateral Trade Agreements and related Ministerial Decisions in favour of developing country Members, which included questions relating to the invocation of the Enabling Clause to notify customs unions among developing countries. He hoped that Members could have a substantive discussion on the                                             WT/COMTD/M/103                                                     -7- systemic concerns that had been raised.

The representative of India indicated that his intervention related to the three sub-items under the present agenda item, since the three RTAs referenced in these sub-items had been ""dually notified"" under both the Enabling Clause and GATT Article XXIV. He noted that the systemic concerns that were raised by China, Egypt and India over the legal and procedural implications of the dual notification of the GCC Customs Union under both the Enabling Clause and GATT Article XXIV were pertinent even now, but they remained unaddressed. Some Members had expressed the view that the systemic concerns raised in document WT/COMTD/W/175 were outside the scope of the CTD, and needed to be discussed in the Negotiating Group on Rules (NGR). The view of his delegation was that the CTD was the appropriate forum to consider the questions arising from RTAs with a dual notification. Pointing to the terms of reference of the CTD contained in document WT/L/46, he noted that the CTD was designated to serve as a focal point for consideration and coordination of work on development in the WTO and its relationship to development-related activities in other multilateral agencies. He added that the Committee could consult with other WTO bodies in addressing the systemic concerns raised in document WT/COMTD/W/175. This was in keeping with paragraph 3 of the CTD's terms of reference which entrusted the Committee to review periodically, in consultation as appropriate with the relevant bodies of the WTO, the application of special provisions in the Multilateral Trade Agreements and related Ministerial Decisions in favour of developing country Members, and in particular LDC Members, and report to the General Council for appropriate action. In concluding, he indicated that the three sub-items under the present agenda item should remain on the CTD's agenda until the systemic and specific concerns arising from ""dually notified"" RTAs were addressed.","WTCOMTDM103.pdf","GATT, China, Egypt, India, GCC, Customs, Union, GATT, Members, CTD, CTD, CTD, CTD, WTO, Committee, WTO, CTD, Committee, WTO, Members, Members, General, Council, CTD"

In his view, the item relating to the GCC issue was not clear, nor had any work been performed on this issue in the Committee.

She underscored that for the EU, it was of extreme importance to clarify the legal and procedural issues arising from RTAs being notified under different legal provisions. Nonetheless, the GCC Customs Union should be distinguished from the two other RTAs. This was because the GCC Customs Union issue was not one of dual notification, since Article XXIV of the GATT was the legal basis for notifications of customs unions. The EU's position had been repeated on several occasions at previous CTD meetings.

He then urged those Members that wanted these sub-items to be maintained on the agenda to think carefully about the rationale for this. Referring to the remaining proposal in document WT/COMTD/W/192 that had been discussed earlier, he noted that the objective was meant to be the submission of joint notifications by Members.

Referring to the explanation in the CTD Chairman's communication WT/COMTD/W/223 on the criteria for drawing up the list of non-notified RTAs, first published in September 2011, she inquired why there was a modification of the March 2013 list (WT/REG/W/73) involving the inclusion of a separate title for ""Agreements under the LAIA Framework"". This new version of the list was introduced at the 68 th session of the CRTA, and there was no record of the adoption of this new criterion in the minutes of the previous session. She additionally made reference to the CTD Chairman's comment in the communication WT/COMTD/W/223 concerning the lack of a ""consensus"" for circulating the document ""Report to the WTO on Instruments Concluded under the 1980 Treaty of Montevideo"" under the symbol WT/COMTD/N/*, and argued that WTO Members could not object to a notification made by another Member country. Should there be any questions, this could be done on the basis of the document notified and circulated as such. The Committee and the Secretariat did not have the authority to reject or object to a notification or to give it a different character from the one required by the notifying Member. She inquired, without prejudice to what she previously stated, as to why the CTD Chairman believed that notifications duly submitted by LAIA member countries could not be considered in the CTD, and were thus subject to the decisions adopted in the CRTA. According to paragraph 18 of the Transparency Mechanism, the CTD was the body entrusted with the implementation of the Mechanism for RTAs falling under paragraph 2(c) of the Enabling Clause.","WTCOMTDM103.pdf","Uruguay, CTD, CTD, Chairman, CRTA, CTD, Chairman, WTO, Montevideo, WTO, Members, Member, Committee, Secretariat, Member, CTD, Chairman, LAIA, CTD, CRTA, CTD"

She said that she wished to provide at the present meeting preliminary comments on the responses contained in document WT/COMTD/W/224. Detailed comments would be provided at the meeting of the CRTA. First, she noted that the EU's questions to LAIA member countries were not erroneously submitted to the CRTA, as claimed by LAIA members. Indeed, these questions were submitted to the CRTA because the EU was seeking clarifications on the Agreements listed in the non-notified RTAs list prepared by the Secretariat and circulated at every CRTA meeting. Second, she clarified that the EU was not objecting to a notification made by LAIA members and that the aim of the EU's questions to LAIA members was mainly to understand the content of their notifications and annual reports, in particular their legal status. She went on to say that notifications needed to respect the notification template for RTAs and be notified by the individual members concerned by the arrangement, in order to trigger the notification process and allow for the necessary transparency. Third, she turned to the substance of the replies provided by LAIA members in the aforementioned communication. She recalled one legal argumentation provided by LAIA members, which was that the regional agreements (AR), Economic Complementarity Agreements (ACE) and partial agreements constituted ""mechanisms for the implementation"" and were the ""instruments for the development of the objectives and functions of the 1980 Treaty of Montevideo"" and were thus to be interpreted as falling under its legal umbrella. With respect to this legal argumentation, she underscored that for the EU delegation, the 1980 Treaty of Montevideo was a political declaration of intent and did not contain concrete RTA disciplines and tariff treatment provisions. She subsequently requested that LAIA countries clarify the meaning of ""implementation"".","WTCOMTDM103.pdf","European, Union, LAIA, CRTA, EU, LAIA, CRTA, LAIA, CRTA, EU, Secretariat, CRTA, EU, LAIA, EU, LAIA, LAIA, LAIA, Montevideo, EU, Montevideo, RTA"
"470",470,"57","57.    She went on to indicate that at this stage, the EU did not see how the subsequent tariff granting agreements - which were built on the 1980 Treaty of Montevideo - could indeed be characterised as implementing measures only falling under Section D of the Transparency Mechanism. Therefore, she requested that LAIA countries provide more details on some of the agreements contained in the list of non-notified RTAs so as to allow Members to understand that these agreements were indeed only implementing measures. Fourth, she highlighted the inconsistency in the interpretation by LAIA members that a newly acceded country to LAIA (e.g. Panama) was covered by the original 1980 Treaty of Montevideo and therefore exempted from any notification, given that Cuba did notify its accession to LAIA. In closing, she reiterated the readiness of the EU delegation to engage in constructive discussions with the Chair and LAIA members in order to make progress on this longstanding issue and enhance further transparency in RTAs.","WTCOMTDM103.pdf","EU, Montevideo, Members, LAIA, Panama, Montevideo, Cuba, EU, LAIA"
"471",471,"58","58.    The representative of the United States said that, while his delegation would continue to engage with LAIA members on the content of the document in future meetings of the CRTA, he wished to provide some preliminary comments at the present CTD meeting. He said that those comments were without prejudice to the US' view that these LAIA agreements remained non- notified. Accordingly, the CRTA was the appropriate forum to discuss these issues. He additionally noted that the sharing of the US' views in the CTD should not be considered as the expression of the readiness of his delegation to consider that eventual notifications under the Enabling Clause would be appropriate. Turning to the LAIA communication itself, he argued that there were some fundamental unanswered questions about what exactly LAIA members were submitting with                                         WT/COMTD/M/103                                                - 10 - respect to their annual and biannual reports to the CTD. For the US delegation, the recent submission made by LAIA members in document WT/COMTD/N/53 reflected further clarifications of these members' views. While this clarification was helpful and might contribute to make progress on this issue, further discussion would be needed on what constituted a notification. He subsequently moved on to consider LAIA members' responses to EU's questions. He said that these responses confirmed that the 1980 Treaty of Montevideo contained only political level objectives with respect to future tariff and non-tariff preferences to be extended among the LAIA members. By way of illustration, he referred to the responses provided in paragraph 1.2 of document WT/COMTD/W/224 and said that these responses had shown that no specific treatment for any specific products was set out in the Treaty itself.","WTCOMTDM103.pdf","United, States, LAIA, CRTA, US, LAIA, CRTA, US, CTD, LAIA, LAIA, CTD, US, LAIA, LAIA, EU, Montevideo, LAIA"
"472",472,"59","59.    He made reference to two other responses by LAIA members. The first one was provided in paragraph 1.3 (c), and stipulated that specific tariff preference negotiations were subsequently undertaken in the context of the Regional Agreements on Market Opening for Bolivia, Ecuador and Paraguay, and the Regional Tariff Preference Agreement. Additionally, the responses indicated that bilateral or plurilateral tariff preferences were negotiated separately under the Partial Scope Agreements provision of the Treaty, and referred to as ACE. The second response was an assertion made later in the document - that both Regional Agreements and Partial Scope Agreements were modifications of the 1980 Treaty of Montevideo, under paragraph D of the Transparency Mechanism for RTAs. In light of these responses, he reiterated the longstanding view of his delegation that the 1980 Treaty contained only political objectives and accordingly, it was not appropriate to assert that the subsequent establishment by LAIA members of tariff preferences were modifications of an existing agreement. He noted that while the additional Protocols to the Agreements negotiated by LAIA members might be appropriately considered as modifications to existing preferences according to paragraph D of the Transparency Mechanism for RTAs, Regional Agreements and Partial Scope Agreements did not fall under paragraph D. Taking up the issue relating to the accession of Panama, the representative of the US said that he did not understand how LAIA could assert that a simple clause in a political document that allowed accession by future parties had exempted existing and future parties from any transparency or notification obligations arising from the extension of new tariff or non-tariff preferences. He went along the lines of the EU and noted that Cuba's notification of its accession to the 1980 Treaty of Montevideo was an indication that prior to the establishment of the RTA Transparency Mechanism, LAIA members recognized their obligation vis-à-vis other WTO Members to notify these agreements. In that respect, he called upon Panama to properly notify all its relevant agreements. He reaffirmed that his delegation would note for the record that RTAs containing preferential treatment that went beyond tariffs would not be notifiable under the Enabling Clause. This was because the Enabling Clause was specifically limited to tariff preferences, and its coverage of non-tariff measure preferences would be permitted only in accordance with conditions decided upon by all Members. For the US delegation, these conditions had not yet been established. In closing, he expressed the appreciation of his delegation for LAIA members' engagement on these important issues and looked forward to continuing cooperation on this matter.","WTCOMTDM103.pdf","LAIA, Bolivia, Ecuador, Paraguay, Montevideo, LAIA, LAIA, Panama, US, LAIA, EU, Cuba, Montevideo, RTA, Transparency, Mechanism, LAIA, WTO, Members, Panama, Members, US"

These were the Arab Maghreb Union, the Economic Community of Central African States, the Economic Community of West African States, the Economic Cooperation Organization, the Inter-Arab Investment Guarantee Corporation, the Islamic Development Bank, the African Union, the Organisation of the Islamic Conference, the South Centre, the Pacific Islands Forum, the United Nations Environment Programme, the West African Economic and Monetary Union and the World Intellectual Property Organization. These organizations had been invited to the present meeting.

"475",475,"61","61.   The representative of Japan reiterated the view of his delegation that a systemic issue of this nature should be discussed and resolved in the CRTA. Accordingly, he looked forward to constructive discussions on this matter at the July 2017 CRTA meeting. He took note of the new submission from Uruguay (WT/COMTD/N/53) on behalf of some LAIA members concerning their new    agreements      signed   under    the   1980    Montevideo      Treaty,   for   the   period 1 January 2016 - 31 December 2016. He underlined that some improvements were made in this new submission in terms of the format of the document and its legal clarity, and considered these as a positive step forward. However, further examination of this notification would be needed, as it was circulated immediately before the present meeting. He reserved the rights of his delegation to make further comments at a later stage. Finally, he reaffirmed Japan’s position that any substantive agreement concluded outside of the WTO framework should be reviewed in the appropriate forum of the WTO based on the factual information and through proper procedures.","WTCOMTDM103.pdf","Japan, CRTA, CRTA, Uruguay, LAIA, Montevideo, Treaty, Japan, WTO, WTO"
"476",476,"62","62.   The representative of Panama informed the Committee that Panama was in the process of taking the necessary steps to notify the pending agreement to which it was party. He added that further consultations would be needed to ensure that this notification would be as uncontroversial                                          WT/COMTD/M/103                                                 - 11 - and user-friendly as possible. In that respect, he requested Members to be patient so as to allow his delegation to do the requisite work. Moving onto the systemic concerns raised in the present and past meetings, he indicated that Members had different interpretations of the rules governing a Member's submission of notification, including the forum in which such notification would be made. In his view, in the event a notification would not meet WTO Members' expectations, the latter should be pragmatic, because an apparent shortcoming could be due to the complexity of the coordination that needed to be ensured. Otherwise, lengthy discussions would take place on procedural issues, - like in some past meetings - and no progress would therefore be made on the substantive issues, including transparency, questions, and replies.","WTCOMTDM103.pdf","Panama, Committee, Panama, Members, Members, Member, WTO, Members"

"480",480,"66","66.    The representative of Chinese Taipei welcomed the fact that discussions on e-commerce took place at the November 2016 and March 2017 CTD meetings and that the Work Programme on E-commerce had become a standing item on the CTD agenda. He informed the Committee that his delegation would be circulating before the summer break, written papers on e-commerce for discussion at the next CTD meeting. He also shared some of the views expressed in these papers. He noted that e-commerce had changed the way of conducting trade in the modern world, because the availability and efficiency of digital transmission had created new methods of trading, such as e-books, 3-D printings, and telemedicine. Therefore, it was important to find ways of bridging the digital divide, in particular by helping developing country Members, especially LDCs, getting access to information and communication technology (ICT) infrastructure and services, hence enhancing their e-commerce readiness.","WTCOMTDM103.pdf","Taipei, Work, Programme, CTD, Committee, CTD, Members, ICT"
"481",481,"67","67.    He went on to say that one of the most useful ways of analysing the e-commerce matter at the WTO was to look into the fundamental differences between e-commerce and traditional trade. In particular, barriers applied to the digital trade through the Internet were significantly different from those encountered in traditional trade. He took the example of cyberspace trade barriers - most of them being applied at the early stages of the transaction process - and argued that the restrictions that they introduced on access to data or information on the internet, had been preventing potential buyers or consumers from even noticing the existence of the foreign commodity. These would definitely preclude the comparison of goods and services, and any order, shipment or customs check, and therefore wipe out all trade opportunities at the early stage of the transaction process. Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) would be particularly disadvantaged, as the majority of them did not have other channels of access to potential foreign buyers. Against this background, he considered important and fundamental that the WTO ensure reciprocal and equal access to the Internet for all its Member countries. In addition, this equality had to apply to all stages of an electronic transaction, including during the communication and access stages, before any transaction would be made or any matching of demanders and suppliers would take place.","WTCOMTDM103.pdf","WTO, Medium, Enterprises, WTO, Member"
"482",482,"68","68.   The representative of China reiterated the strong commitment of China to the discussion on e-commerce, given the importance of the latter for development. He added that this commitment was exemplified by the communication that China had co-sponsored. He suggested that in light of the sensitivity and complexity of the e-commerce issue, Members should reflect carefully on the e-commerce elements that could be included in the outcome of MC11. He went on to propose a series of questions on which Members could reflect in the perspective of MC11. These included: (i) what specific development elements can be reflected in MC11 e-commerce outcome?; (ii) what kind of technical-assistance actions regarding e-commerce could Members take under the WTO framework?; (iii) would Members be flexible to accept some best practices on e-commerce as an MC11 outcome provided that they would be best endeavour initiatives?; (iv) would Members agree that elements like streamlining customs procedures on e-commerce and the mutual recognition or                                          WT/COMTD/M/103                                                 - 12 - promotion of e-signature and e-authentication would be beneficiary for developing Members and SMEs?; and (v) what would be the challenges and opportunities for developing Members, especially the LDCs in this regard?","WTCOMTDM103.pdf","China, China, China, Members, Members, Members, WTO, Members, Members, Members, Members"
"483",483,"69","69.   The representative of Nigeria reaffirmed the active engagement of his delegation on discussion on e-commerce. He recalled the importance of the development aspects of e-commerce and noted in that respect that Nigeria had co-sponsored a proposal on e-commerce and was also member of the Group of Friends of E-commerce for Development, which had organized several workshops to deepen Members' understanding on the e-commerce issue. He additionally reminded the Committee that the work being carried out in the CTD was governed by the MC10 Ministerial Decision on E-commerce, which urged Members to continue the work under the 1998 Work Programme on Electronic Commerce, based on the existing mandate and guidelines and on the basis of proposals submitted by Members in the relevant WTO bodies, as set out in paragraphs 2 to 5 of the Work Programme. In closing, he said that his delegation found the series of questions proposed by China very pertinent and would review them in the perspective of MC11.","WTCOMTDM103.pdf","Nigeria, Nigeria, Group, of, Friends, of, E-commerce, for, Development, Members, Committee, CTD, Members, Electronic, Commerce, Members, WTO, Work, Programme, China"

She seized the opportunity to welcome the new co-sponsors of this communication, namely Moldova and Ukraine. She emphasized the importance that the EU accorded to technical assistance and capacity building in support for e-commerce development in the digital area of its development agenda. She went on to argue that the EU was keen on discussing challenges and opportunities in the e-commerce area. For example, the development aspects of e-commerce would be at the heart of the EU's forthcoming Aid-for-Trade strategy. The EU also enacted recently a European Investment Plan, which might very strongly support digitalization. In addition, the EU was envisaging in its External Investment Plan considering the potential actions to support digitalisation and a separate strand of work to support building/updating of the national regulatory frameworks, including in online trade. Another example was the recent initiative called ""Digital for Development"" that the EU had undertaken with a view to streamlining development assistance in four priority areas related to digital economy including, digital infrastructure, of which the necessary regulatory frameworks; digital literacy and digital skills; digital for growth, entrepreneurship and job creation; and digital technologies as an enabler. She believed that this initiative could be part of future discussions on the challenges associated with e-commerce.","WTCOMTDM103.pdf","European, Union, Moldova, Ukraine, EU, EU, EU, EU, EU, EU"

The representative of South Africa, on behalf of the African Group, recalled that the African Group had been approaching the exploratory discussions under the Work Programme on E-commerce from a perspective that had given paramount importance to the development implications of e-commerce, taking into account the economic, financial, and development needs of developing countries. She indicated that the Group would be interested in an exchange of views and experiences on the basis of the current Work Programme on E-commerce. For the Group, the immediate priority of the Committee should be a fuller assessment of the wide-ranging disruptions that would result from the fourth industrial revolution, the growth of digital trade and e-commerce. In that respect, discussions in the CTD under the Work Programme should take up issues that would prioritize the needs of developing countries and LDCs, especially the challenges to and ways of enhancing their participation in electronic commerce. For exporters of electronically delivered products, these challenges included, inter alia, the improvement of access to infrastructure and transfer of technology, as well as the movement of natural persons.","WTCOMTDM103.pdf","South, Africa, African, Group, African, Group, Work, Programme, Group, Group, Committee, CTD, Work, Programme"
"487",487,"72","72.    She went on to suggest that discussion on e-commerce should be framed around measures that foster inclusion and equitable development for all developing and least developed countries. Specifically for the African Group, critical areas of interest for future discussion on e-commerce included the reality of increasing digital inequality, the importance of digital rights, the existing extremely high market concentration levels in the current global e-commerce space, and the range of attempts at a national level to shape digital flows in order to influence trade and affect national digital catch-up. Addressing these issues would help African governments explore their own policy options, with a view to achieving Africa’s longstanding developmental objectives of industrial development, structural transformation and employment, in the context of the profound changes brought on by the so-called ""Fourth Industrial Revolution"".","WTCOMTDM103.pdf","African, Group, Africa"

"489",489,"74","74.    This statement, as reflected in the Minutes of the 101st session of the CTD, went as follows: the representative of South Africa, on behalf of the African Group indicated that the tabling of submissions in the CTD was in line with paragraph 1.1 of the 1998 Work Programme, and consistent with paragraph 1 of the Nairobi Decision on e-commerce. She said that continental integration, structural transformation and industrialization were the overriding priorities for Africa, as had been laid out by African Trade Ministers. She made reference in this regard to the Continental Free Trade Area (CFTA), as well as to Agenda 2063: The Africa We Want, and emphasized the need for work undertaken at the multilateral level to support Africa’s continental integration agenda. With regard to e-commerce, she said that the African Group approached the exploratory discussions under the 1998 Work Programme from a perspective that gave paramount importance to the development implications of e-commerce, taking into account the economic, financial, and development needs of developing countries. In this light, she believed that several issues that were included in the proposals under consideration were better suited for discussion in the Council for Trade in Goods (CTG), the Council for Trade in Services (CTS) or the TRIPS Council. Furthermore, some of the issues fell outside the scope of the 1998 Work Programme, or were being taken up extensively in other international organizations. She urged the proponents to refine their proposals in order to make them specific to the body where discussions should take place, as per the Work Programme.","WTCOMTDM103.pdf","CTD, South, Africa, African, Group, CTD, Nairobi, Africa, Continental, Free, Trade, Area, Africa, African, Group, Council, for, Trade, in, Goods, CTG, Council, for, Trade, in, Services, Work, Programme"
"490",490,"75","75.    She went on to say that the African Group wanted the CTD to take up issues that placed at their centre the needs of developing countries and LDCs. She highlighted in this regard the importance of addressing ways of enhancing the participation of developing countries in e-commerce, and the associated challenges. A number of examples were provided, including with respect to infrastructure, industrialization and workforce skills. It was noted that the potential benefits of e-commerce for developing countries could not be assumed or asserted. It was pointed out, inter alia, in this regard that fixed broadband penetration remained at 0.7% in Africa and the LDCs, and Africa was the only region in the world where broadband penetration remained below 20%. Bringing about socially equalizing effects would not be possible when only some had access to digital technology – whilst others had partial or no access, and also had no rights over the technology. According to the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD), four countries accounted for 80% of business-to-business (B2B) e-commerce, which was the largest form of e-trade. With regard to business-to-consumer (B2C) e-commerce, the Middle East and Africa together accounted for only 2.5%. Accordingly, discussions in the CTD had to address the asymmetrical nature of the existing global e-commerce space, in order to enable Africa to become e-commerce ready. One of the overriding questions of the African Group was how to build an inclusive growth and equitable development trajectory for all developing countries and LDCs. She encouraged Members to share their experiences on measures employed to develop capabilities in the digital economy. In closing, she expressed the commitment of the African Group to engage in a comprehensive discussion in the CTD on all issues relating to the development implications of e-commerce.","WTCOMTDM103.pdf","African, Group, CTD, Africa, Africa, United, Nations, Conference, on, Trade, and, Development, UNCTAD, Middle, East, Africa, CTD, Africa, Members, African, Group, CTD"

In closing her intervention at the present meeting, the representative of South Africa, on behalf of the African Group, highlighted some elements of the African Group's statement delivered on the March 2017 CTD meeting, and reflected above. She noted that a number of issues contained in the proposals on e-commerce would be better suited for a discussion in the other relevant bodies, such as the CTG, the CTS and the TRIPS Council. This statement also indicated that at least two submissions on e-commerce did not cover the most important elements in the Work Programme under development. Furthermore, some of the issues fell outside the scope of the 1998 Work Programme, or were being taken up extensively in other international organizations. Therefore, the proponents were urged to refine their proposals in order to make them specific to the body where discussions should take place, as per the Work Programme.","WTCOMTDM103.pdf","South, Africa, African, Group, African, Group, CTG, CTS, Work, Programme, Work, Programme"
"492",492,"77","77.    The representative of Uganda, on behalf of the LDC Group, noted that the proponents of the various proposals had taken into account the process that had been earlier suggested to Members, which was that submissions relating to e-commerce needed to be first taken to the relevant bodies, as set out in paragraphs 2 to 5 of the 1998 Work Programme. Discussions would need to have matured in these bodies before being reported to the General Council. He recalled a number of elements from paragraphs 1.1 and 1.2 of the Work Programme, and emphasized that the non-negotiating mandate of the Work Programme was exploratory in nature. He went on to say that, since the establishment of the Work Programme, the digital divide for LDCs had widened. In theory, e-commerce was supposed to help surmount the obstacles faced by weaker countries when competing with stronger players. However, in reality, most LDCs had to deal with a number                                            WT/COMTD/M/103                                                  - 14 - of constraints – relating to insufficiencies in basic infrastructure, electricity and internet access, as well as to the high cost of broadband connectivity. LDCs also faced a number of bottlenecks that prevented them from taking advantage of the opportunities that were theoretically available through e-commerce platforms. The LDC Group believed that, in order for LDCs to be able to benefit from e-commerce, the three key issues, including access, affordability and availability, needed to be addressed. He went on to provide some figures that put into context the present situation of the LDCs. He mentioned, inter alia, that only 15% of the population in LDCs used the internet. Fixed broadband penetration remained at below 1% in Africa and the LDCs. In light of the low penetration rate in the Internet use, LDCs were not in a position to take advantage of the benefits of e-commerce.","WTCOMTDM103.pdf","Uganda, LDC, Group, Members, General, Council, Work, Programme, Work, Programme, Work, Programme, LDCs, LDCs, LDC, Group, Africa, LDCs"
"493",493,"78","78.    He indicated that discussions under the Work Programme needed to focus on overcoming the challenges that were hindering LDCs from becoming e-commerce-ready. It was suggested that discussions could focus on a number of specific issues, including access to electricity, access to digital infrastructure and cheap and fast broadband, inadequate skills, and technology transfer. He went on to express support for the intervention by the African Group, and particularly noted that most of the proposals under consideration fell outside the scope and mandate of the 1998 Work Programme. He invited the proponents to narrow down their submissions to issues specific to the CTD, and to focus on the elements contained in paragraph 5.1 of the Work Programme, with a view to addressing the digital divide. He also highlighted the need to complement, and not undermine, initiatives within Africa, and in particular Agenda 2063: ""The Africa We Want"". He believed that it was important to examine the implications of e-commerce for the structural transformation and industrialization of Africa, and what the impact would be on domestic markets, domestic manufacturers and service suppliers. Finally, he outlined the plans of the International Telecommunications Union (ITU) to connect 1.5 billion people to the internet, and regretted that funds were not being made available for this purpose. In this regard, he expressed concern with the downward trajectory in Aid for Trade, particularly for LDCs, and stressed the need for consistency in the message and practice of donors.2","WTCOMTDM103.pdf","Work, Programme, African, Group, CTD, Work, Programme, Africa, Africa, International, Telecommunications, Union, ITU, LDCs"
"494",494,"79","79.    The representative of Uganda, on behalf of the LDC Group, added that he wished to highlight some points of the statement delivered by the Group at the March 2017 CTD meeting. He said that the starting point was the 1998 Work Programme on E-commerce that allowed it sufficient space to have an extensive and exhaustive discussion on e-commerce. This Work Programme had no negotiating mandate, but was, however, exploratory in nature. He argued that while in theory the e-commerce phenomenon could be beneficial to consumers and businesses in weaker countries and help enterprises become stronger players in the international trading system, in reality, most LDCs faced a number of constraints, which prevented them from taking advantage of opportunities theoretically available through the e-commerce platforms. These constraints included, inter alia, insufficient basic infrastructure and access to electricity and to the Internet, high cost of broadband connectivity. Discussions in seminars on e-commerce organized by different agencies at the WTO had shown that some WTO Members, including developing countries, had derived substantial benefits from e-commerce. However, it was still unclear what domestic regulatory policy frameworks were adopted by these countries to afford their domestic industries the requisite policy space, and protection, to grow and thrive until such a time that they became strong, emerging and dominant players. In this light, the LDC Group requested that major players share their experience on the digital industrial policies that they employed to, inter alia, guarantee their digital rights and ensure their current prosperity. Turning to the way forward, he suggested that as most of the submissions on e-commerce fell outside the scope and mandate of the Work Programme, the proponents should narrow their submissions to issues specific to each particular body. In addition, in the event this would not be possible, the proponents should focus on the development-related aspects of the work programme, with a view to considering the examination of issues at the heart of the digital divide that needed to be resolved in order to build the e-commerce readiness of LDCs. These included the improvement of access to infrastructure; transfer of technology; the movement of natural persons; and the use of information technology.","WTCOMTDM103.pdf","Uganda, LDC, Group, Group, CTD, Work, Programme, WTO, WTO, Members, LDC, Group, Work, Programme"

She believed that in light of the existing digital divide between developed and developing countries, it would be premature to discuss rule-making on e-commerce at this stage. She went on to say that there was no consensus on the launch of e-commerce negotiations as required under paragraph 34 of the Nairobi Declaration. She invited Members to avoid discussions of issues that went beyond the scope of the WTO and the mandate of the Work Programme such as, the Internet governance, which had been one of core issues of other international organizations such as the ITU and the World Summit on the Information Society (WSIS). She underlined the importance for developing countries of sovereign rights over data, as such data represented valuable national asset. Developing countries should be allowed to have the requisite policy space - so as to build up and store their own data locally - and the capacity to develop their own cross border platforms. She noted that the 2017 WSIS Forum had clearly shown that the major challenges that Africa was facing in terms of digital divide were energy shortage and access to the grid connection. In that respect, she noted with concern that the digital divide between developed and developing countries continued to grow with the rapid expansion of the digital economy. She invited the Committee to take a developmental approach and deliberate on how to increase developing countries' capabilities so as to bridge this digital divide.","WTCOMTDM103.pdf","Zimbabwe, South, Africa, Uganda, Work, Programme, Committee, Work, Programme, Uganda, LDC, Group, Group, CTD, WTO, Members, WTO, Work, Programme, ITU, Information, Society, WSIS, WSIS, Forum, Africa, Committee"

She additionally requested that Members exchange information and discuss ways to promote transfer of technology to developing countries, improve infrastructure, promote the development of digital industrial policies and online platforms in developing countries and address the extremely high market concentration levels in global e-commerce. Such discussions could be framed around the impact of the digital industrial revolution on inequality, digital rights, job creation and retention in developing countries as well as the type of development cooperation suitable for developing countries that needed to embark on digital industrialization. She then called on the proponents of submissions on e-commerce to revise their proposals so as to align them with the mandate of the Work Programme, and in particular to make them specific to the body – CTD, CTG, CTS and TRIPS Council- where discussions should take place, as per this Work Programme. Finally, she invited the proponents to eliminate from the proposals elements that went beyond the scope of the WTO or elements on rule-making.","WTCOMTDM103.pdf","Members, Work, Programme, CTD, CTG, WTO"

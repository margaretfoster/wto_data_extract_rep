"1501",1501,"130","130.     The representative of the European Communities on the basis of the Report of the March 1998 WTO Symposium on Trade Facilitation, and having regard to the presentations referred to by his delegation, including the presentation by the European Communities, invited the Secretariat to prepare a summary of the elements of interest to Committee Members namely on trade facilitation as a driving force in development policy. This would be a useful approach. His delegation was uncertain as to whether this would duplicate the request by the representative of Egypt, but was certain that this was a proposal that had the merit for further examination.","WTCOMTDm22.pdf","WTO, European, Communities, Secretariat, Committee, Members, Egypt"
"1502",1502,"131","131.      The representative of the UNECE said that the organization had undertaken important work in this area in the past 30 years. Bearing in mind the discussions underway, he noted that some delegations had highlighted the interoperability issues between electronic commerce and trade facilitation. Indeed, the subject of trade facilitation was amenable to analysis from different perspectives. In his view, if the 21st Century global trading system would be composed of two major components namely, (i) the multilateral trading system, based on MFN treatment, and (ii) an electronic trading system, based on most favoured network treatment, it would then be easy to identify a linkage between trade facilitation and electronic commerce.","WTCOMTDm22.pdf","UNECE, MFN"
"1503",1503,"132","132.   He remarked that the work of the UNECE focused on Electronic Data Interchange which was a backbone of most electronic commerce and trade facilitation. This should be further considered at the Committee. To this end, he suggested that a complementary view would be helpful from the Centre for the Facilitation of Procedures and Practices in Administration and Commerce and WT/COMTD/M/22 Page 28 Transport (CEFACT). Such a view would offer ideas as to the major issues in the linkage between the multilateral trading system and the electronic trading system. He said that over 40 years of GATT/WTO work had been focused on market access and market presence issues, however, the UNECE envisioned a new area of market communication issues. He, therefore, proposed that the Committee should invite at its next meeting the representative of CEFACT to address the Committee on the major issues before it and the UNECE regarding the linkages between trade facilitation and electronic commerce within the multilateral trading system.","WTCOMTDm22.pdf","Electronic, Data, Interchange, Committee, Facilitation, of, Procedures, and, Practices, in, Administration, and, Commerce, GATT/WTO, UNECE, Committee, Committee"
"1504",1504,"133","133.    The representative of Panama welcomed the presentation by UNCTAD. It noted that the mechanism of Trade Points (Centres) had been created for the purpose of trade facilitation. In a number of countries in Central and South America, there were several projects in this regard. His delegation requested UNCTAD's impressions/assessments as to how these Trade Points had contributed to trade facilitation, for instance in Central and South America? Furthermore, what type of follow-up had been accorded to these projects?","WTCOMTDm22.pdf","Panama, UNCTAD, South, America, UNCTAD, South, America"
"1505",1505,"134","134.    The representative of India welcomed the UNCTAD presentation. She said that the representative of Mexico had usefully highlighted the importance of small and medium enterprises as the principal entities in developing countries. Against this background, her delegation was therefore of the view that the Committee should discuss the role of trade facilitation in furthering the trade prospects of developing countries particularly in the conduct of trade through electronic means. She also referred to the statement by the representative of the European Communities which had highlighted the indispensable nature of trade facilitation for development activities. All these dimensions, in the view of her delegation, should be discussed in the Committee within the framework of the Work Programme on Trade Facilitation of the CTG. The representative of India, in addition, requested for clarity on the nature of the reservations by some countries on various elements of the Kyoto Convention. Such a discussion in the Committee would make it possible to understand the diversity of administrative and facilitation practices across the world and in particular the problems that were endemic to developing countries.","WTCOMTDm22.pdf","India, UNCTAD, Mexico, Committee, Committee, Work, Programme, CTG, India, Committee"
"1506",1506,"135","135.    The representative of UNCTAD responded to the comments made and questions raised. First, the trade points were based on the rationale of assisting traders within a country to enter into negotiations with other traders to buy and to sell goods and services. It was geared to address the problems faced by small and medium-sized exporters and importers. It was intended to be a private sector oriented system. However, UNCTAD had noticed that some trade points were based in ministries. This was not an efficient use of the system. In countries where the trade points had been located within chambers of commerce they had usually turned out to be more effective. However, there was not a single recipe for the success of trade points. In some places, the trade points had been more successful than others.","WTCOMTDm22.pdf","UNCTAD, UNCTAD"
"1507",1507,"136","136.      He noted that several comments had been made on the linkages between electronic commerce and trade facilitation. In this regard, he invited Committee Members to participate in the Partners for Development Meeting in Lyon from 9 to 12 November 1998. At this meeting, electronic commerce would be one of the subjects to be discussed, as would be other subjects such as transport, trade facilitation, trade points, micro-financing, bio-trade, etc. Several pre-occupations raised at this meeting would be discussed at the Lyon meeting which would engage the private sector and civil society.","WTCOMTDm22.pdf","Committee, Members, Partners, for, Development, Meeting, Lyon, Lyon"

The Chairman informed the Committee that he had received a letter from the Chairman of the Committee on Regional Trade Agreements (CRTAs) requesting him to bring to the attention of the Committee the recommendations by the CRTAs on the requirements for submission of information on the regional trade agreements contained in paragraph 4(a) of the Enabling Clause. The recommendations were contained in document WT/REG/6 before the Committee.","WTCOMTDm22.pdf","Chairman, Committee, Chairman, Committee, Committee, Committee"
"1511",1511,"14","14.      The representative of Norway thanked the Secretariat for the Three-Year Plan, even though the Plan raised concerns about its financing. There had been a rapid increase in technical cooperation and training activities since 1995. His delegation was encouraged by the improvements in these activities as shown by the use of new technologies and the organization of regional seminars, which were cost efficient and effective and should be increased. His delegation had noted from the Secretariat document, the possibility of a funding shortfall for future demand technical cooperation and training activities. This situation could force difficult choices and prioritization. He underscored the principle that technical cooperation and assistance should be demand-driven, but if available funds are limited, LDCs should be given priority. Furthermore, constraints on funding for technical cooperation should lead to increased cooperation amongst WTO, ITC and UNCTAD and increased out-sourcing of parts of WTO's technical cooperation and assistance activities to ITC, UNCTAD, and possibly also to other organizations. On the concerns expressed by the representative of Tanzania on the financing of technical cooperation, his delegation's position was that the only viable solution was to increase the core fund.","WTCOMTDm22.pdf","Norway, Secretariat, Secretariat, LDCs, WTO, ITC, UNCTAD, WTO, ITC, UNCTAD, Tanzania"

The representative of the United States expressed appreciation for the Secretariat document which highlighted issues of importance that the Committee will face in the coming years, particularly questions relating to implementation of the various agreements, and awareness and consciousness-raising requirements in order for Members to fully understand their rights and obligation in the WTO. She expressed appreciation of the joint initiative by the WTO and the WIPO on the TRIPS Agreement to provide enhanced technical assistance for countries requesting assistance on implementation. The need for countries to meet their obligation by the year 2000 would place more emphasis on technical cooperation and assistance in 1999.

"1525",1525,"152","152.    The Chairman drew attention to the fact that the Committee had to adopt an Annual Report for 1998. In this connection, he noted that the next meeting of the Committee was scheduled for 7 December 1998, a date which would not permit adequate time for the adoption and processing of the Annual Report before the report was forwarded for consideration to the General Council at its meeting scheduled for 10 and 11 December 1998. For the purpose of the review, the General Council needed to consider the report no later than 27 November 1998. The Chairman also said that the form of the CTD Report, pursuant to the General Council's Decision on reporting procedures contained in document WT/L/105, should be brief, factual in nature and provide an indication of the actions and decisions taken by the Committee in the year under review.","WTCOMTDm22.pdf","Chairman, Committee, Committee, General, Council, General, Council, Chairman, General, Council, Committee"

In view of the fact that the 23rd Session of the Committee had been scheduled for 7 December 1998 which came after the deadline for submitting adopted reports to the General Council, the Chairman suggested that the Committee request the Secretariat to prepare a draft factual Annual Report for 1998 and circulate it to Members. If any Member had comments on the report, that Member would inform the Secretariat of such comments no later than Friday, 13 November 1998. Thereafter, an informal meeting of the Committee would be convened just before the meeting of the Sub-Committee on Least-Developed Countries on Wednesday, 25 November 1998 to discuss the Annual Report.

"1529",1529,"156","156.    The representative of Egypt said that it would be best and more meaningful to informally consult on the issue of trade facilitation after Members had received a paper from the Secretariat.","WTCOMTDm22.pdf","Egypt, Members, Secretariat"
"1530",1530,"157","157.    The Chairman in response noted that at the informal consultations no decision would be reached. Furthermore, there would be a need to discuss more and specify the parameters of the paper to be produced by the Secretariat. Also, it would be necessary to harmonize the proposals by Egypt and the European Communities.","WTCOMTDm22.pdf","Chairman, Secretariat, Egypt"
"1531",1531,"158","158.     The representative of Egypt said it was willing to go along with the proposal by the representative of the European Communities. What his delegation required was a simple, factual, structured paper based on the papers that had been previously submitted, and the outcome of the March 1998 WTO Symposium on Trade Facilitation. Such a paper would allow Members to consider the issues in a coherent way.","WTCOMTDm22.pdf","Egypt, WTO, Members"
"1532",1532,"159","159.  The Secretariat thanked delegations for their proposals and said that it would be useful to have more informal consultations on the contents of the paper requested by delegations from the                                                                                  WT/COMTD/M/22                                                                                         Page 31 Secretariat on trade facilitation. There had been a major symposium in March 1998 on the subject with major contributions from governments and the private sector, but more clarification was needed to provide the Secretariat with more focus. Furthermore, contributions from delegations on this issue would be very welcome even on an informal basis. He sought the understanding of Members that a Secretariat paper should not precede the informal consultations until Members provided more clarifications on the contents and the parameters of the paper which had been requested.","WTCOMTDm22.pdf","Secretariat, Secretariat, Secretariat, Members, Secretariat, Members"
"1533",1533,"16","16.      The representative of Bangladesh commended the Secretariat for its valuable document. As an LDC, his delegation attached importance to technical cooperation and training activities and was benefitting immensely from such activities. His delegation appreciated the current focus on the regional spread of the activities, and would like to see it expanded. Like Tanzania and Norway, Bangladesh was also concerned with the funding of technical cooperation and training activities. While expressing gratitude to the generous contributions from donors, his delegation was concerned that funding was uncertain, irregular and ad hoc. His delegation would recommend that funding for technical cooperation activities should become part of the regular budget; the General Council should work to this end. His delegation also wondered how technical cooperation and assistance programmes could be critically evaluated, as if they were being financed from the regular budget, whereas the funding was from individual donors. His delegation would welcome the views of other Members on this observation. If the activities surrounding the LDC programme were not funded from the regular budget, it would be difficult to imagine a predictable programme for LDCs. His delegation supported the proposal by the representative of Norway to accord priority to LDCs in the event of budgetary short-falls, he was confident that developing country delegations would not object to the Norwegian proposal.","WTCOMTDm22.pdf","Bangladesh, Secretariat, Tanzania, Norway, Bangladesh, General, Council, Members, Norway"
"1534",1534,"160","160.    The Chairman in the absence of any further comments re-affirmed that the informal consultations would then include trade facilitation.                                             __________","WTCOMTDm22.pdf","Chairman"
"1535",1535,"17","17.      The representative of Egypt, while welcoming the Secretariat document, raised several issues and concerns. First, the way in which activities were counted was sometimes misleading. For instance, an activity involving a large amount of resources and many man hours by a large Secretariat delegation could not be compared to another activity over a day or two and involving only one Secretariat official. He hoped that more accurate measures would be devised for monitoring and evaluating technical cooperation and assistance activities, rather than using the number of activities which were not always indicative of size, scope and the nature of the activities. Second, as was evident in paragraph 6 of the document, his delegation was concerned with the fact that much of the Secretariat's activities was tied up with dispute settlement; when assistance was requested, his delegation and several others were often confronted by the fact that Secretariat officials were occupied with dispute settlement procedures that require their full attention. This problem required further attention. Third, his delegation attached importance to the use of information technology in the delivery of technical assistance, mentioned in paragraph 7 of the report. Egypt felt that the use of information technology could assist developing countries in addressing some of the difficulties associated with the implementation of WTO Agreements. His delegation requested the Secretariat to prepare a background note on activities taking place in relation to the use of information technology for the delivery of technical assistance, the Secretariat's thinking on the nature, and the scope for development of information technology in this regard.","WTCOMTDm22.pdf","Egypt, Secretariat, Secretariat, Secretariat, Secretariat, Secretariat, Egypt, WTO, Secretariat, Secretariat"
"1536",1536,"18","18.      Fourth, his delegation supported the idea of out-sourcing of technical assistance, such as the sub-contracting of technical assistance, mentioned in paragraph 8 of the document, because of the limited resources available to the Secretariat. However, this idea might need examination by the Committee on Budget, Finance and Administration. His delegation hoped that this could be done in order to allow out-sourcing to experts outside the Organization. Fifth, while cooperation between the WTO and other organizations was important, Egypt was concerned with the imbalance between the need for observance of obligations within the WTO and the relegation of technical assistance to other organizations. This had been observed, by his delegation, with regard to the joint initiatives with WIPO on the TRIPS Agreement and with the ITU and telecommunications. This issue required further examination. The problem was that the objective of the WTO was to have different Members implement their commitments, whereas the objective of some other international organizations included such things as issues relating to long-term human resource development, and not necessarily the implementation of commitments in the WTO. Sixth, Egypt welcomed the trend towards regional cooperation. However, it had to be borne in mind that in some cases, national requirements were specific and different from regional needs, therefore, a balance needed to be struck. Next, his delegation shared the concern expressed on funding, and supported the position emphasized by Tanzania on the need for predictability in funding. Additional information and greater transparency                                                                                      WT/COMTD/M/22                                                                                              Page 5 were required on conditions attached by donors on their contributions to the Trust Funds as well as their stated priorities for technical assistance. Delegations had a right to know of conditions attached by donors to contributions and to their technical assistance offers. Lastly, the representative of Egypt noted that in paragraph 18, the Secretariat stated that the global objectives of its technical cooperation objectives, as summarized in a previous document, continued to be valid. However, his delegation was concerned that some of the objectives incorporated in the WTO guidelines had not been explicitly included in the overall objectives, including the full integration of beneficiaries into the multilateral trading system and strengthening human capacity-building in developing countries.","WTCOMTDm22.pdf","Secretariat, Committee, on, Budget, ,, Finance, and, Administration, WTO, Egypt, WTO, WIPO, ITU, WTO, Members, WTO, Egypt, Tanzania, Egypt, Secretariat, WTO"
"1537",1537,"19","19.      Finally, on the activities per se, his delegation, in addition to the position stated by the United States, felt that it was important that technical assistance and cooperation should aim at assisting developing countries after the transitional period and assist developing countries in the preparation of future negotiations.","WTCOMTDm22.pdf","United, States"
"1538",1538,"2","2.       The Chairman recalled that since the last meeting, the Moroccan delegation had submitted a paper entitled: ""Review of the Application of Special Provisions in the Multilateral Trade Agreements and Related Ministerial Decisions in Favour of Developing Country Members (WT/COMTD/W/46). Following open-ended informal consultations, consensus had emerged that the Secretariat should prepare a letter to Members containing a questionnaire regarding any difficulties being experienced by Members in the implementation of special and differential provisions in the WTO Agreements. The Chairman emphasized that the Secretariat would compile and analyze any replies, but make no judgements. This letter and questionnaire had now been circulated to Members.","WTCOMTDm22.pdf","Chairman, Members, Secretariat, Members, Members, WTO, Chairman, Secretariat, Members"
"1539",1539,"20","20.      The representative of Philippines, speaking on behalf of ASEAN, commended the Secretariat for its comprehensive background document. She noted the increase in the request for technical cooperation and assistance activities by developing countries. This thrust should be encouraged. ASEAN attached importance to the trade policy courses, and to this end commended the Secretariat for arranging, at least, two trade policy courses annually in English. These courses were widely sought after. Finally, her delegation sought clarification, following the re-structuring of the Secretariat, on the nomenclature of the Technical Cooperation Division, which now no longer had the ""Training"" component in the title. Her delegation sought assurance that training courses would continue undiminished.","WTCOMTDm22.pdf","Philippines, ASEAN, Secretariat, ASEAN, Secretariat, Secretariat, Technical, Cooperation, Division"
"1540",1540,"21","21.      The representative of Switzerland welcomed the Secretariat paper. His delegation attached importance to several issues under this agenda item. These included the discussion of the Secretariat Three-Year Plan for technical cooperation and training activities, transparency in funding and execution of such activities, critical evaluation of technical cooperation activities, and lessons to be learned from such activities. He posed several questions on the Three-Year Plan; for instance, his delegation felt that more detailed description of projects would assist in better judgement of the projects. The financing of technical cooperation and training activities presented a problem to be solved. The large number of Trust Funds and their operation were non-transparent, confusing, impractical for both donors and the Secretariat, and placed a management burden on the Secretariat. Switzerland believed there should be multilateral trade-related technical cooperation, managed in detail and evaluated by the Secretariat, which would limit the detailed involvement and evaluation of donors. In this regard, more had to be done.","WTCOMTDm22.pdf","Switzerland, Secretariat, Secretariat, Secretariat, Secretariat, Switzerland, Secretariat"
"1541",1541,"22","22.      Responding to the views expressed by Egypt on dispute settlement, the representative of Switzerland stated that this was a core activity of the Secretariat, and should not be reduced. By contrast, technical cooperation was not a core WTO activity, and was not an area of comparative advantage for the WTO relative to other organizations. Accordingly, out-sourcing should be pursued, and more thinking was required on activities which should be out-sourced. Before a final position was taken, detailed evaluation was required to determine, for instance, which activities should be out- sourced and which retained for execution by the Secretariat. Regarding measures for the evaluation of technical cooperation and training activities, his delegation agreed with the representative of Egypt that the number of activities was not a good measure. However, in the absence of any other measure, Members had to work on this quantitative basis with its limitations. For instance while 141 activities had been planned for 1998, according to the Secretariat document, the actual number of activities was 277, almost double the number planned. This highlighted several problems, including those of predictability for planning purposes and the divergence between plans and reality. Closer examination showed that the variance in the figures was accounted for by external invitations to the Secretariat, together with the follow-up to the HLM for LDCs, which was expressed separately as an WT/COMTD/M/22 Page 6 additional category. His delegation was firmly of the view that a detailed analysis of technical cooperation and training activities was only possible after a detailed evaluation.","WTCOMTDm22.pdf","Egypt, Switzerland, Secretariat, WTO, WTO, Secretariat, Egypt, Members, Secretariat, Secretariat"
"1542",1542,"23","23.      The representative of Canada commended the Secretariat for an excellent paper. Her delegation emphasised the importance and the desirability of the regional approach, the link-up with regional institutions and funding institutions. The regional approach was particularly important in the light of upcoming negotiations. Her delegation supported the Secretariat approach to reach-out to other organizations and the emphasis placed on the training of trainers. She considered that a main issue in technical assistance arena was the lack of coherence at the regional level. Coherence could be improved both improved both horizontally with better coordination amongst donors, and vertically by ensuring a proper sequence in the delivery process. The Three-Year Plan and the follow-up to the HLM and the Integrated Framework were steps in the right direction. Her delegation shared expressed concerns on ensuring appropriate funding for technical cooperation and assistance.","WTCOMTDm22.pdf","Canada, Secretariat, Secretariat, Integrated, Framework"
"1543",1543,"24","24.      The representative of Australia commended the Secretariat for an interesting and thorough paper that provided the basis for transparency in the area of technical cooperation. She expressed satisfaction for the attention given to issues of increased productivity and out-sourcing especially in regional areas where there would be greater expertise and familiarity with problems to be addressed. Australia was also satisfied with the follow-up to the High-Level Meeting. Her delegation was encouraged by the cooperation between the Secretariat and other international organizations, particularly in areas where there was complementarity, such as WIPO. The Secretariat Paper showed that there was growing demand for technical cooperation in areas that were comparatively new for the WTO. The WTO would be under pressure to respond, and there was much to be learnt in the future. Financing issues needed to be explored. Greater focus would be required on the value-added aspects in the best roles of the WTO such as noted by Egypt with regard to implementation and the mandated future negotiations. While noting and agreeing to the links between broader development aims, infrastructure, human resource development, and an ability to implement WTO commitments, her delegation emphasised the importance of the need for a careful examination of the Secretariat's expertise, capacities, and how best to work with other organizations to fulfill the needs of this Organization. The WTO had an important role to play in trade and development for developing countries, but it was only one aspect, and there were many other organizations that could contribute. Finally, her delegation welcomed the transparency which brought out the important linkages in the area of technical cooperation.","WTCOMTDm22.pdf","Australia, Secretariat, Australia, Secretariat, WIPO, Secretariat, WTO, WTO, WTO, Egypt, WTO, Secretariat, WTO"

"1545",1545,"26","26.     Mr. Léger began by saying that technical cooperation was not the exclusive responsibility of the Technical Cooperation Division, but was the responsibility of all Divisions in the Secretariat. More than 50 per cent of technical cooperation activities in 1998 were undertaken by other divisions in the Secretariat. Second, human resources in these divisions might, in future, be diverted to other processes and issues, such as those leading to the 3rd Ministerial Conference, to the mandated negotiations, and to the increased recourse by developing countries to dispute settlement procedures.","WTCOMTDm22.pdf","Léger, Technical, Cooperation, Division, Secretariat, Secretariat"
"1546",1546,"27","27.     On the specific matter of financing, Mr. Léger stated that the Secretariat currently expected a considerable shortfall in resources for 1999. He indicated that in 1998, the Secretariat would have spent approximately Sfr5 million in connection with Technical Cooperation activities of which the regular budget is Sfr741,000 only. Currently, a shortfall existed of Sfr3 million, representing, according to average cost calculations for 1998, 20 regional seminars or 150 technical cooperation missions.","WTCOMTDm22.pdf","Léger, Secretariat, Secretariat"
"1547",1547,"28","28.     Regarding the method of reporting technical cooperation activities, the Secretariat was willing to consult with interested delegations to determine how best to improve on reporting of activities, for                                                                                     WT/COMTD/M/22                                                                                             Page 7 example, either with regard to number of staff hours, or in the number of days, or whether such activities were at the national or regional level.","WTCOMTDm22.pdf","Secretariat"
"1548",1548,"29","29.     In response to the request from the Egyptian delegation, he noted that the Secretariat would prepare a background note on information technology. This was a new field, holding a lot of promise for technical cooperation and training. As suggested by Egypt, the Secretariat would revise paragraph 18 of its paper, taking into consideration the issue of full integration, and the strengthening of human and institutional capacity.","WTCOMTDm22.pdf","Secretariat, Egypt, Secretariat"
"1549",1549,"3","3.      The representative of Egypt sought confirmation of his delegation's understanding that the Secretariat, while awaiting responses, would commence work based on information currently available in the Secretariat, such as from trade policy review reports, reports from technical missions by the Technical Cooperation Division, statements made by delegations, and other sources.","WTCOMTDm22.pdf","Egypt, Secretariat, Secretariat, Technical, Cooperation, Division"
"1550",1550,"30","30.      In response to the representative of the Philippines, the Director confirmed that the Division was still responsible for training; and explained that the change in the name of the Division took place was based on the fact that training could be delivered in different ways such as through video-conferencing, cassettes, and other means that were not available in the past. Furthermore, training could suggest to some delegations that only a one-way communication was envisaged. This was not the case. Training was a two-way communication, and the Division had as much to learn from delegations with regard to culture and approaches to training, as delegations had to learn from the experts either from the WTO or from experts in other international organizations assisting the WTO in the training courses. For these reasons, it was felt proper to assume the title of Technical Cooperation Division.","WTCOMTDm22.pdf","Philippines, Director, WTO, WTO"
"1551",1551,"31","31.     Responding to the observation by Switzerland that comparison of the planned activities for 1998 relative to those that actually took place showed an approximate doubling of the numbers, Mr. Legér said that based on the Secretariat's short experience since 1995, this was not unusual. Most missions that took place could not be foreseen at the time when the Secretariat requested developing countries to provide indications of technical assistance needs for the following year. In addition, many actors were involved in each mission such as the Secretariat, the hosting country, account had to be taken of funding resources as well as coverage, participation and documentation; and all of these had an impact on the exact dates and coverage of these actual missions.","WTCOMTDm22.pdf","Switzerland, Legér, Secretariat, Secretariat, Secretariat"
"1552",1552,"32","32.      The representative of Switzerland requested clarification on two issues: first, on the definition of the background note request by Egypt; and, second, on the reasons for the divergence in the Secretariat's Plan figures for technical cooperation activities envisaged at the beginning of 1998 and the final actual figures for the same year. On the latter, he noted that although discrepancies could arise, the doubling of figures between Plan figures and actual figures was significant, and the Secretariat should try to improve on the system to ensure more predictability.","WTCOMTDm22.pdf","Switzerland, Egypt, Secretariat, Secretariat"
"1553",1553,"33","33.      In response, Mr. Hoda, Deputy Director-General, recalled that technical cooperation activities are Member-driven. To the extent that Members could state early in the year what activities they foresee, and to the extent that information existed on the activities of other organizations, improvements could be made. However, current experience showed that Members' requests do not arrive at the beginning of the year but as time goes on. The situation was very similar with international organizations. Some could give early notice of the activities that they would like the Secretariat to participate in, while others could not. The Secretariat could correctly anticipate the numbers if it the entire planning was within its complete control. Inputs from other Members requesting technical assistance and from other international organizations desirous of collaboration with the WTO could not be fully anticipated.","WTCOMTDm22.pdf","Hoda, Director-General, Members, Members, Secretariat, Secretariat, Members, WTO"
"1554",1554,"34","34.      Mr. Léger clarified the second issue raised by the representative of Switzerland. He recalled that since last year, there had been several WTO Secretariat initiatives on information technology. These included making available to Members through the Document Dissemination Facility (DDF), the previous day's documents in all official languages together with a search capability; and installation in LDC Members, WTO Reference Centres with connection to the Internet, access to the WTO website, and access to the Information Development website which is a joint undertaking with WT/COMTD/M/22 Page 8 the World Bank.       This year, the WTO Secretariat had used, at least on two occasions, video-conferencing means for training purposes, and it intended to place more emphasis on this vehicle in the near future. Technical cooperation training courses would be available on the WTO internet website, by 15 November 1998. Videos are being developed on WTO Agreements, for example, one is currently being developed on the Agreement on Textiles and Clothing. These videos would explain the agreements with their rights and obligations.","WTCOMTDm22.pdf","Léger, Switzerland, WTO, Secretariat, Members, Members, WTO, WTO, Information, Development, World, Bank, WTO, Secretariat, WTO, WTO"
"1555",1555,"35","35.      The representative of Switzerland agreed that the use of information technology was important for technical cooperation. However, he wondered if separate papers should be requested for on each area of technical cooperation. Regular separate reporting on technical cooperation activities should cover every area, including the use of information technology means. His delegation was not certain as to the need for the paper requested by Egypt. His delegation had understood the question by Egypt and the consequent request to the Secretariat to ask the Secretariat to describe the possible ways for using information technology to deliver technical cooperation and assistance, and hence improve the cost efficiency and operation of technical cooperation and assistance. If this was the understanding, Switzerland would not oppose the request by Egypt.","WTCOMTDm22.pdf","Switzerland, Egypt, Egypt, Secretariat, Secretariat, Switzerland, Egypt"
"1556",1556,"36","36.      The representative of Egypt saw no a contradiction between the statement by the representative of Switzerland and the preliminary descriptions by the Secretariat. The use of information technology for the delivery of technical cooperation and assistance was a new area. As a result, more information was required for a proper understanding of its use. In addition, this was a cross-cutting issue because different kinds of technical assistance could be delivered through the means of information technology. It was not simply a question of a specific area where information was required on a sectoral basis. The whole purpose was to better understand the use of information technology as a means for delivering technical cooperation and assistance. This was an important question for the development, dissemination and improvement of the quality of technical assistance.","WTCOMTDm22.pdf","Egypt, Switzerland, Secretariat"

The representative of Japan briefed the Committee on a seminar in Singapore entitled: WTO Regional Seminar on Dispute Settlement Procedures and Practices for Asia and Pacific Countries, which had taken place from 29 to 30 October 1998. The seminar had been made possible with financial contributions by the Government of Japan. The purpose of the Seminar was three-fold namely: first, to disseminate comprehensive information on the dispute settlement mechanism in the past three and half-years; second, to hear the assessments of academics on the performance of the mechanism and suggestions for improvement; and third, to undertake an informal exchange of views amongst the participants, which included representatives of 11 Member Governments, academics from four Member Governments, and WTO Secretariat officials.","WTCOMTDm22.pdf","Japan, Committee, Singapore, WTO, Asia, Pacific, Countries, Japan, Member, Member, WTO, Secretariat"
"1559",1559,"39","39.     The Chairman recalled that at the last meeting of the Committee, the Secretariat had been requested to prepare a document for further reflection on the evaluation of technical assistance. The document had now been circulated with reference Job No. 4299. The document referred to the Guidelines for Technical Cooperation and Training and the Implementation Modalities; examined the manner of assessing technical cooperation and training, made a distinction between internal and external evaluation; and addressed the issue of evaluation criteria. The document contained an annex with a questionnaire used by participants for assessing technical cooperation activity, and for discussing training activities conducted in the WTO Trade Policy Courses.

"1561",1561,"40","40.      The representative of Switzerland welcomed the Secretariat paper, which offered many issues for reflection. He requested the Secretariat to undertake with the Committee an internal evaluation of WTO technical cooperation activities, based on document Job No.4299, which could provide the basis for developing a methodology for internal evaluation. In this connection, an informal process could be established comprising interested delegations and the Secretariat for implementing internal evaluation.","WTCOMTDm22.pdf","Switzerland, Secretariat, Secretariat, Committee, WTO, Secretariat"
"1562",1562,"41","41.      The representative of the European Communities (EC) noted that the Secretariat paper raised the right questions. Technical assistance activities were difficult to qualify and measure. Two reasons were central in the evaluation of any activity: one was to measure the degree of success in achieving the objectives, and the other was to learn lessons and to increase the effectiveness of future activities. In this regard, it was necessary to establish criteria for success. Preferably, it was best to establish these criteria in the planning stage, and also to involve the recipients in the establishment of criteria. The EC believed that several questions were relevant such as: (a) at what levels of activity should evaluation be undertaken bearing in mind different levels, for example, sectors, seminars, countries and regions; (b) what criteria should be used; and, (c) how will be the lessons of the past and the present be integrated into future policies and practices? In the view of her delegation, the basic objective and criteria of WTO technical assistance was to increase the knowledge of WTO rules and regulations, and to enhance the ability of developing countries to take advantage of the system. These were the basic objectives and criteria against which WTO technical cooperation and assistance had to be evaluated.","WTCOMTDm22.pdf","EC, Secretariat, EC, WTO, WTO, WTO"
"1563",1563,"42","42.      The representative of the United States underscored the importance of introducing procedures and criteria for evaluating the effectiveness of technical cooperation and assistance. She recalled the position by Egypt stressing the utility of targeting specific and demand-driven approaches rather than raising issues in the abstract. She emphasised the importance of taking advantage of available technical assistance, whatever the means for delivery. The United States had mentioned initiatives for enhanced technical assistance, for example, through out-sourcing as in the WIPO/WTO initiative. In the light of the interest by delegations, her delegation wondered how Members would avail themselves of the technical assistance opportunities present in that joint initiative. Follow-up to programmes, raised in the Secretariat report, was another important issue. To this end, it was necessary that beneficiary governments should provide on-going substantive support for those undergoing training, and to ensure that information acquired was used to achieve the goals of the training activity.","WTCOMTDm22.pdf","United, States, Egypt, United, States, Members, Secretariat"
"1564",1564,"43","43.      The representative of Norway welcomed the useful Secretariat paper. His delegation considered that there were core principles that should constitute guiding principles for evaluation. First, was the establishment of relevant criteria for evaluation, which could be quantitative or qualitative. These should include cost efficiency and the impact of technical assistance on the beneficiaries. Such criteria should be simple, practical, objective and transparent. Second, evaluation should be continuous and an integral part of WTO technical assistance activities. Third, external evaluation should be conducted regularly with a view to assessing whether technical assistance had the anticipated impact on the beneficiaries. Fourth, as a rule, the costs of technical assistance should be covered by core funding. Fifth, the use of questionnaires for participants in trade policy courses and seminars was a useful instrument and could be further developed. His delegation supported the idea of regularly circulating questionnaires to beneficiary countries. This procedure would offer a beneficiary an opportunity to provide details of assistance received and how such assistance, including skills acquired, had been used.","WTCOMTDm22.pdf","Norway, Secretariat, WTO"
"1565",1565,"44","44.     Norway agreed with the view expressed in the Secretariat paper that it would be a challenge to establish a system of evaluation because the results of the activities would often be difficult to measure. Nonetheless, donors still expected some form of evaluation in order to establish a causal link between technical assistance and results or lack of results. Therefore, an effort at evaluation WT/COMTD/M/22 Page 10 should be made; in its absence, it would be difficult to defend the expenses. His delegation agreed with the Secretariat observation that requests for technical assistance were often very general. To this end, his delegation joined with the Secretariat in encouraging Members to be more specific in their formulation of requests for technical assistance, such as the specific objectives they would like to achieve through the technical assistance. Finally, in establishing a system of evaluation for the system, account must be taken of the need to evaluate joint activities with other agencies and to avoid evaluation of overlapping programmes. His delegation supported the position of Switzerland to hold informal consultations on the issue of evaluation.","WTCOMTDm22.pdf","Norway, Secretariat, Secretariat, Secretariat, Members, Switzerland"
"1566",1566,"45","45.      The representative of Japan welcomed the Secretariat paper and re-emphasised the importance of technical assistance. Due to budgetary constraints, cost effectiveness and the quality of technical assistance were very important. In this regard, evaluation was a necessary exercise. Considering the three dimensions of evaluation namely, internal Secretariat evaluation, external evaluation and beneficiary evaluation, his delegation believed that these three methodologies were complementary and could be used simultaneously to maximise the advantage of each system. His delegation shared the view of the European Communities that the evaluation methodology used by other international organizations could be useful, even though WTO technical assistance was specific in nature. He supported the Norwegian and Swiss proposals for informal consultations.","WTCOMTDm22.pdf","Japan, Secretariat, Secretariat, WTO"
"1567",1567,"46","46.      The representative of Morocco recalled that the first task to carry out was to decide on evaluation procedures. It was not possible to address evaluation, including the substantive aspects, until procedures exist. These procedures would guide the WTO in the evaluation of technical cooperation and assistance activities. Constant internal evaluation was necessary. Such internal evaluation should be structured and institutionalized in the form of an internal evaluation unit. Nonetheless, external evaluation must also take place. To ensure complementarity between external and internal evaluation and the independence of the evaluation exercise which should aim at transparency and impartiality and, as a consequence, assess the impact of WTO technical assistance activities. A methodological framework needed to be established to serve as a basis for subsequent evaluation. This framework could include several elements to cover implementation and impact. Within this framework several criteria would be useful. These criteria would relate to the general objectives of the WTO and the more specific aims of particular technical assistance programmes. His delegation stated that the scope of evaluation should not only include the assessment of the impact of technical assistance, but should also consider the implementation of technical assistance programmes. This form of assessment should be part of both assessment and implementation of technical cooperation programmes. In this way, corrections can be made to technical assistance and cooperation programmes, if necessary, as those programmes were underway. There should also be mid-term evaluation of programmes which would make it possible to improve on implementation of programmes.","WTCOMTDm22.pdf","Morocco, WTO, WTO, WTO"
"1568",1568,"47","47.      He believed that the financing of technical cooperation should be considered by the Committee in coordination with the Committee on Budget, Finance and Administration. This financing could be undertaken in several ways. It should be financed from the regular budget. However, financing from extra-budgetary sources should not be excluded. He said his delegation would codify its proposals in order to contribute to the debate of the item. Finally, he supported the proposals by delegations for informal consultations on the item to enable a decision on procedural issues for further progress on the item.","WTCOMTDm22.pdf","Committee, Committee, on, Budget, ,, Finance, and, Administration"

The representative of El Salvador stated that trade policy courses, referred to in the document, were of immense value and importance for the training of her country's trade policy officials.

The representative of Jamaica commended the Secretariat for the high quality documentation; evidence that the concerns and interests of developing countries for integration and full participation in the multilateral trading system were being advanced. He emphasised several key issues. First, in evaluation it was important to strengthen and enhance human and institutional capacities in the public and private sector. Second, the key test of the effectiveness of technical assistance was how well it assisted Jamaica to fulfill its obligations and to enforce its rights, if the rights needed enforcement. Third, technical assistance was not an adjunct to the implementation of the Agreements, but a systemic matter. Technical assistance was not a set of discrete and separate activities, but a systemic and integral part of the fulfilment and implementation of WTO Agreements. Jamaica judged technical assistance as effective, if it enabled it to secure the balance of its benefits from its participation in the multilateral trading system. He believed that this position was held, not only by Jamaica, but also by other trading partners, to the extent that it made the trading regimes of these countries more transparent and open, and allowed the expansion of trading opportunities in domestic economies and in the economies of the trading partners. Technical assistance was therefore not simply a project or a supplement to implementation. Technical cooperation was also not a charitable contribution by some Members to others.","WTCOMTDm22.pdf","Jamaica, Secretariat, Jamaica, WTO, Jamaica, Jamaica, Members"
"1571",1571,"5","5.      The Chairman recalled that the delegation of Egypt had submitted a Working Paper on ""Electronic Commerce in Goods and Services"" circulated as WT/COMTD/W/38 in March 1998. The Working Paper included several proposals, inter alia, the proposal that the Secretariat should be requested to prepare an analytical paper on enhancing the participation of developing countries in electronic commerce and the use of information technology in the integration of developing countries in the multilateral trading system. He further recalled that at the informal consultations on 16 September 1998, the Secretariat informed the Committee that it was preparing a document on the WT/COMTD/M/22 Page 2 development dimension of electronic commerce. Furthermore, on 25 September, the General Council adopted a comprehensive Work Programme on Electronic Commerce. In the Work Programme, terms of reference were allocated to four WTO bodies. In this regard, the Committee had been asked to examine and report on the development implications of electronic commerce, taking into account the economic, financial and development needs of developing countries. The issues to be examined included:         -       Effects of electronic commerce on the trade and economic prospects of developing                 countries, notably of their small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), and means of                 maximizing possible benefits accruing to them;         -       Challenges to and ways of enhancing the participation of developing countries in                 electronic commerce, in particular as exporters of electronically delivered products:                 role of improved access to infrastructure and transfer of technology, and of movement                 of natural persons;         -       Use of information technology in the integration of developing countries in the                 multilateral trading system;         -       Implications for developing countries of the possible impact of electronic commerce                 on the traditional means of distribution of physical goods;         -       Financial implications of electronic commerce for developing countries.","WTCOMTDm22.pdf","Chairman, Egypt, Electronic, Commerce, in, Goods, Secretariat, Secretariat, Committee, General, Council, Work, Programme, Electronic, Commerce, Work, Programme, WTO, Committee"
"1572",1572,"50","50.      Fourth, referring to the last sentence of paragraph 12, in document WT/COMTD/W/48, on the subject of ""financial considerations"", he disagreed with the sentence which read as follows: ""In the absence of additional Trust Funds, current conditions would force the WTO to scale down technical cooperation activities by about 3 million Swiss francs or by some 20 regional seminars or 150 national missions based on the average cost for 1998"". If this occurred, it would mean the scaling-down of the opportunity for the integration of developing countries in the multilateral trading system. This was the reason he had underscored the point that technical assistance was not an adjunct or supplementary to the implementation of WTO Agreements. In the same paragraph, he had noted the distribution of contributions by Members to Trust Funds. However, he had not seen the quantum of funds available in the regular budget for technical cooperation activities, but felt that it would be less than the 3 million Swiss francs projected as shortfall. Consequently, in the evaluation of technical cooperation and in the review of future activities, the WTO should be prepared to use the regular budget and to ensure that a proportionate amount of resources are available to meet the objectives of integration. He also said that an idea suggested by his delegation, following its Trade Policy Review the previous week, was that the range of trade policy reviews of developing countries could be considered and assessed over time with a view to usefully identifying and indicating the lacunae in their notifications and in the implementation of their obligations. As a result, technical cooperation should not be general but focus on the specifics. It was a systemic part of implementation; and should, therefore, fit all the WTO Agreements together to ensure that small economies and developing countries were integrated.","WTCOMTDm22.pdf","WTO, WTO, Members, WTO, WTO"

The prospect of cooperation between the WTO and other international organizations should be welcomed. Complementarity should be promoted to the benefit of recipient countries. His delegation welcomed the Secretariat document, which was intended to manage the present while preparing for the future. The evaluation of technical cooperation and training was not a simple matter. Consequently, his delegation supported those who had proposed the holding of informal consultations to address the issue of evaluation.","WTCOMTDm22.pdf","Senegal, WTO, WTO, Secretariat"
"1574",1574,"52","52.      On the evaluation of training programmes, he noted that the Secretariat had faced a number of difficulties. An example, was the difficulty faced in the choice of candidates for the training courses, which was in the hands of beneficiary countries. Some of the difficulties turned on the fact that sometimes beneficiary countries sent the same officials to the various training courses, and sometimes lacked various elements for measuring the impact of the assistance programmes on recipient countries. In this regard, some of the problems which were rooted in the exercise of state sovereignty were difficult to solve. Training was important. In the evaluation of WTO training programmes, he WT/COMTD/M/22 Page 12 considered that it would be up to the Secretariat, Member States and the trainees, to consider the objectives that had been set and to regularly assess the content of the training courses, the quality of the support materials used, and the educational approach. In this regard, he felt that the number of Trade Policy training courses, particularly those in French, were insufficient. External evaluation of training programmes would be difficult; evaluation would be better conducted by the Secretariat, the trainees and the recipients. To assist recipients and beneficiary countries undertake the evaluation, questionnaires from the Secretariat would be helpful. Furthermore, contacts between the WTO and former trainees should be maintained. To this end, the website for former trainees was useful in the maintenance of these contacts. Electronic training activities were to be stressed and supported.","WTCOMTDm22.pdf","Secretariat, WTO, Secretariat, Member, Secretariat, Secretariat, WTO"
"1575",1575,"53","53.      He said that external expertise would be required in the evaluation of technical cooperation programmes in the beneficiary countries, since this would relate to a judgement on concrete elements. The example of customs services was a specific area where external evaluation would determine whether the implementation of a technical assistance programme had improved the customs service in a country. The scope of evaluation should be comprehensive to cover all technical cooperation activities whether financed through the regular budget or through Trust Funds. A formula should be found to satisfy donors whose main concern was that there should be an objective evaluation. For evaluation involving joint technical assistance between the WTO and other organizations, there should be a specially adapted evaluation to the original aspects of the programme in question.","WTCOMTDm22.pdf","WTO"
"1576",1576,"54","54.     He also said that further consideration should be accorded to the proposal that former staff Members could be used as evaluators because of their familiarity with the WTO. While advantages were evident, disadvantages could also arise as evaluation by these former staff Members could be ""in-house"" evaluation. This proposal had to be further examined.","WTCOMTDm22.pdf","Members, WTO, Members"
"1577",1577,"55","55.       Criteria for evaluation should be simple, objective, transparent and practical. In the course of the evaluation, account should be taken of qualitative and quantitative criteria. However, quantitative criteria, such as the number of activities could be misleading. For instance, some seminars had low participation rates. However, an indicator such as respect for notification obligations was a good indicator that measured the degree of a country's awareness of such obligations as well as the absorption of assistance received.","WTCOMTDm22.pdf",""
"1578",1578,"56","56.     In conclusion, the representative of Senegal emphasised several points. First, technical assistance should be financed from the regular budget. Second, stress should be placed on disseminating information to countries because public opinion in various countries needed information on the WTO.

The Chairman said that the Secretariat had made good progress on the paper, but required more time because of the need for further internal consultations and coordination which were required. He reminded the Committee that two useful documents on electronic commerce were already available namely, the Working Paper submitted by Egypt, and the Special Study by the Secretariat on Electronic Commerce. The Chairman urged the Secretariat to circulate the paper by mid-November. This would make it possible for the Committee to have substantial discussions on the issue at its next meeting.","WTCOMTDm22.pdf","Chairman, Secretariat, Committee, Egypt, Secretariat, on, Electronic, Commerce, Chairman, Secretariat, Committee"
"1583",1583,"60","60.     The international system was undergoing dynamic which had entailed incessant changes. Only a few countries could keep pace with these changes; many countries had limited capacity for adjustment to changes. The challenges of adjustment to these changes were more problematic for small economies because of their smallness and limited capacity, geographical situation, vulnerability to external shocks and the vagaries of nature. The vulnerability of these small economies to exogenous factors was exacerbated by their high degree of openness which compounded their economic fragility.","WTCOMTDm22.pdf",""
"1584",1584,"61","61.      He underscored the concern of the paper's co-sponsors for the erosion of the competitiveness of small economies due to the absence of Foreign Direct Investment (FDI). Current uncertainty of the scope of market access for the small economies had made FDI elusive and uncertain. Small economies had undertaken obligations at Marrakesh, which were neither questioned nor reneged on. However, in the short term, the fulfilment of WTO obligations was hampered by financial, human and institutional resource limitations. In signing the Marrakesh Agreement, small economies were not aware of these resource limitations vis-à-vis their obligations. They had hoped that the benefits accruing from the multilateral trading system and the provisions on special and differential treatment in WTO Agreements would assist small economies in overcoming these constraints and limitations. The multilateral trading system had produced overall results, but it was felt by small economies that their marginalization was caused by their inability to secure a share in the growth of international trade commensurate with the needs of their economic development. Having regard to the foregoing, the Committee was confronted with a major task. Economic growth needed to be accelerated. The acceleration of economic growth would facilitate small economies' integration into the multilateral trading system on a sustainable basis.","WTCOMTDm22.pdf","Marrakesh, WTO, WTO, Committee"
"1585",1585,"62","62.      The representative of Mauritius emphasised additional points. Most Members of the WTO were also Members of the United Nations (UN); and this issue of small economies had been addressed over a long period at the UN. Furthermore, some WTO Members were also Members of the Commonwealth; and the Commonwealth similarly was in forefront in addressing this issue. Many studies had been carried out on small economies, particularly on small island economies, by organizations such as UNCTAD and others. It was, therefore, important for the Committee to take up this issue and the challenge that it posed in keeping with the decision by Trade Ministers at the 2nd Ministerial Conference; and, in doing so, to enable the General Council to submit appropriate recommendations to WTO Ministers at the 3rd Ministerial Conference, on how to address the problems of small economies.","WTCOMTDm22.pdf","Mauritius, Members, WTO, Members, United, Nations, UN, UN, WTO, Members, Members, Commonwealth, UNCTAD, Committee, General, Council, WTO"
"1586",1586,"63","63.      The representative of Jamaica began by according full recognition to the special position of least-developed countries (LDCs) among the developing countries, and the priority attention to be accorded to LDCs. His delegation was deeply saddened by the tragic consequences and after effects of Hurricane Mitch and the havoc it had wreaked on the region of Latin America and the Caribbean: whole crops had been wiped out which would have been harvested for exports. Recovery would take time and would be difficult. This situation was a familiar one for the Caribbean region. Based on this situation of vulnerability to external shocks, his delegation was hopeful that WTO Members would show sympathy and understanding. His delegation expressed full solidarity with affected countries and hoped that the effects of the natural disasters of hurricane and flooding would be overcome in the WT/COMTD/M/22 Page 14 region, and that any special measures required would be taken. The connection between trade and development was evident from the situation prevalent in the Caribbean and for small economies. Small economies had made enormous efforts in the past few years to bring their economies into conformity with WTO obligations. The Caribbean countries and banana exporting countries, just like other small economies, wanted to ensure a degree of certainty for and value from their exports. However, these objectives had now been disrupted because of the consequences of the hurricane and other natural disasters.","WTCOMTDm22.pdf","Jamaica, Mitch, Latin, America, Caribbean, Caribbean, WTO, Members, Caribbean, WTO, Caribbean"
"1587",1587,"64","64.      His delegation recognized the work being undertaken by the Commonwealth, the IMF and the World Bank on the issue of small economies. The World Bank deserved special mention because the Prime Minister of Barbados had led a special delegation to several intergovernmental organizations including the WTO to state the concerns of small economies. These small economies made up more than half of the WTO. Small economies understood that a common set of rules and disciplines were required at the WTO, they did not desire a ""second eleven playing field"". They believed that integration in the global economy required that their economies had a place on the same playing field. Small economies were convinced that special attention was necessary to address their problems and vulnerabilities considering that it had become necessary for systemic measures to be taken even for large economies given the recognition in the international monetary system that large economies required special attention given their structural characteristics and their failure to adjust to external financial crisis. Consequently, small economies should not be ignored simply because individually they did not have the same or equivalent systemic effects. The systemic effects of trade distortions and external shocks across the length and breadth of small economies should not be ignored.","WTCOMTDm22.pdf","Commonwealth, IMF, World, Bank, World, Bank, Barbados, WTO, WTO, WTO"
"1588",1588,"65","65.     The representative of Jamaica recognized the efforts of the representatives of Bolivia, Guatemala, El Salvador, Dominican Republic, Cuba and others in ensuring that attention was accorded to small economies. For several reasons, his delegation believed that small economies at the WTO required close and special attention. First, the criteria for ""graduation"" as applied at the World Bank were neither on efficient nor equitable. Consequently, measures which bound small economies to standards of obligations without recognizing their particular characteristics were deleterious to the efficiency and equity of their participation in the multilateral trading system. The valuable papers that had been circulated on special and differential treatment and the paper on small economies circulated by six co-sponsors represented initial efforts to integrate the concerns and problems of small economies as part of the Member-specific special and differential treatment provisions of the WTO Agreements. His delegation believed that all developing countries should seek to become mature economies, but to do so in a way that was consistent with their possibilities.","WTCOMTDm22.pdf","Jamaica, Bolivia, Guatemala, El, Salvador, Dominican, Republic, Cuba, WTO, World, Bank, WTO"
"1589",1589,"66","66.

"1590",1590,"67","67.      The representative of Barbados said that the item on small economies was important and crucial. Her delegation agreed with the specific problems of small economies as highlighted by the representative of Mauritius, and as outlined in the paper by six co-sponsors before the Committee. These problems and constraints included, but were not limited to: (a) physical and geographical attributes; extreme vulnerability to natural disasters; (b) heavy reliance on the sustained good economic performance of the rest of the world, because of the open nature and fragility of small economies; and the smallness of their domestic markets; (c) restrictions faced in the pursuit of economic diversification; (d) high dependence on international trade and foreign investments; and (e) barriers to access of official and private capital flows.","WTCOMTDm22.pdf","Barbados, Mauritius, Committee"
"1591",1591,"68","68.     Recognition of the circumstances of small economies should not be judged at the expense of other developing countries. The special vulnerability of some small states was a matter of enduring                                                                                     WT/COMTD/M/22                                                                                            Page 15 financial and economic distress for these countries. The recent damage by Hurricanes George and Mitch had served to underline the vulnerability occasioned by geographical location. The devastation caused by these hurricanes and other natural disasters had wiped out, in hours, economic growth achieved over many years. There would be lasting effects on the countries affected, some of whom were still re-building from the damages caused by earlier hurricanes.","WTCOMTDm22.pdf","George, Mitch"
"1592",1592,"69","69.      She emphasised that interdependence of national economies was a feature of the current international economic system. The fact had been demonstrated most recently in the global and systemic effects of the Asian financial and monetary crisis. In order to ensure the strength of the global system, the stability of the separate components should be assured. Against this background, therefore, the unique vulnerabilities of small economies should be addressed. Small economies were marginalized in the globalizing world economy because full account had not been taken of the full extent of their vulnerabilities. For instance, the use of the GDP per capita income as a benchmark for differentiation was a blunt instrument. Her delegation welcomed recent indications that international financial institutions would be reviewing this criterion. New criteria and measures must be devised that could be effectively used to meaningfully differentiate amongst countries in the allocation of resources. To this end, work should be accelerated in different fora to develop vulnerability indices designed to provide a broader measure of development for small states.","WTCOMTDm22.pdf",""

"1594",1594,"70","70.      She further emphasised that the special circumstances of small states and the concepts of smallness and vulnerability had been accepted and were pivotal to work in various fora such as at the ACP, the EC, UNCTAD, the Commonwealth Secretariat, the FTAA, the United Nations, IMF and the Inter-American Development Bank. These organizations had incorporated into their analytical work processes the concept that small states have special vulnerabilities. In July 1998, a Commonwealth Ministerial Mission on Small States led by the Prime Minister of Barbados undertook a series of visits to major multilateral agencies in order to place the concerns of small states on the multilateral agenda. The Mission had fruitful discussions with the U.S. State Department, the IMF, the World Bank, the WTO, UNCTAD, and the European Commission. A result of the Ministerial Mission was the establishment of a World Bank/Commonwealth Task Force which was given the mandate to undertake a detailed examination of the special circumstances facing small economies with a view to devising a universally acceptable vulnerability index, and to designing more appropriate assistance programmes to meet the particular concerns of small states. The IMF, UNCTAD, the European Commission, and the WTO had all indicated their wish to contribute to the work of the Task Force. The Task Force would hold its first substantive meeting in London on 7 December 1998. The Task Force would meet in conjunction with an Advisory Group which would include representatives of governments and the private sector, regional organizations and financial institutions. It was envisaged that this Task Force and Advisory Group would hold three substantive meetings before submitting a report to the Development Committee meeting of the World Bank and the IMF which would be held in Spring 1999.","WTCOMTDm22.pdf","ACP, EC, Commonwealth, Secretariat, FTAA, United, Nations, IMF, Inter-American, Development, Bank, Barbados, U.S., State, Department, IMF, World, Bank, WTO, UNCTAD, European, Commission, IMF, UNCTAD, European, Commission, WTO, Task, Force, London, Task, Force, Advisory, Group, Task, Force, and, Advisory, Group, Development, Committee, World, Bank, IMF"
"1595",1595,"71","71.      The representative of Barbados stated that the alleviation of vulnerability was possible. If the international community assisted, including the WTO, it would be possible for small economies to mitigate the constraints and the problems that confront them. Most WTO Members had already subscribed to the concept of the special vulnerability of small states in one forum or another. It was now time, therefore, for the WTO itself to become an arbiter of fairness on this matter. The rules governing the multilateral trading system must not be insensitive to the imperatives of equitable international development. A need existed for the adoption of enlightened policies which would prevent the further economic marginalization of small economies.","WTCOMTDm22.pdf","Barbados, WTO, WTO, Members, WTO"
"1596",1596,"72","72.     The representative of Dominica associated his delegation with the co-sponsors of the paper. It was not necessary to re-state the self-evident arguments for a special consideration of small states which was recognized by Ministers at the 2nd Ministerial Conference. What was now required was for the Committee to advance the process and indicate how mechanisms could be established that would WT/COMTD/M/22 Page 16 give effect to the decision of the 2nd Ministerial Conference. Action was urgent because small states were [""hurting"". This term was emotive, but indeed small states were] ""hurting"" because they were not yet in a position to take advantage of all the possibilities that they understood globalization and liberalization offered. If these trends continued and if small states remained unable to take advantage of these trends, then they would add to the list of ""failed states"". Members needed to be reminded that these states, at great sacrifice to themselves and their populations, had undertaken far-reaching reform measures. In spite of these measures, these states had not yet been able to participate in or benefit from the flows of international finance, investments and trade.","WTCOMTDm22.pdf","Dominica, Committee, Members"
"1597",1597,"73","73.      He noted that notions of per capita income could be misleading. Although most small states, including Dominica, had relatively statistically high per capita incomes, there were other factors beyond them. First, were remittances from migrants. These remittances were not sustainable in the long-run. A characteristic of small economies was that they spent a high proportion of their income on the provision of education, but their incomes were neither large enough nor growing at sufficiently rapid rates to absorb the products of the educational system. As a consequence, the products of these educational systems travelled abroad. However, because of reduced immigration opportunities, ""external financing"" from immigrant remittances, was decreasing. Second, were preferences, as the key factor for a relatively statistically high per capita incomes. Most small states, including Dominica, depended on preferences for entering into the world economy with a limited number of agricultural exports.","WTCOMTDm22.pdf","Dominica, Dominica"
"1598",1598,"74","74.     The representative of Dominica said that if preferences were ""insensitively removed"", then these small states would be condemned to poverty, destitution and hopelessness. This was beginning to happen in Dominica as a result of its experience in banana exports in recent months and due to young farmers leaving the industry. However, these farmers were not entering into any other productive sectors or occupation – ""they were standing at street corners"". Actions being taken at the WTO were undermining the basis for peace, security, democracy and human rights in small states. Dominica could not compete on equal terms with other economies in the global system, which was evident from this statement.","WTCOMTDm22.pdf","Dominica, Dominica, WTO, Dominica"
"1599",1599,"75","75.      Dominica was a small country with a population of 100,000. Half of the population were of school age or below, senior citizens or a further quarter were not gainfully employed. It was difficult to conceive what a workforce of 25,000 could competitively produce and trade in vis-à-vis other larger economies in the trading system. Nonetheless, Dominica would not despair as it was taking action to put in place measures prescribed by the WTO, the World Bank, the IMF, and others, with a view to re-structuring the domestic economy so that, in time, Dominica would be able to take its place with the rest of the world. However, a sufficient period of adjustment and transition were required, as well as, technical, financial and other forms of assistance were also required to put in place prescribed measures.","WTCOMTDm22.pdf","Dominica, Dominica, WTO, World, Bank, IMF, Dominica"
"1600",1600,"76","76.     His delegation, in conclusion, emphasised that small states and their populations should not be sacrificed for doctrinal purity. Preferences were an integral part of the international trading system. They were contained in GSP and GSTP schemes operated by various countries and groupings such as the EC, NAFTA, ASEAN, CARICOM, and elsewhere. Small states, such as Dominica required preferences, over a reasonable period, to assist adjustment and facilitate the application of measures which would produce a strong economy.","WTCOMTDm22.pdf","GSP, EC, NAFTA, ASEAN, CARICOM, Dominica"
"1601",1601,"77","77.     The representative of the Dominican Republic expressed gratitude to the six co-sponsors for having circulated the paper. Her delegation acknowledged the contributions of the representative of Bolivia for her important role in developing the concept of small economies. Her delegation fully supported the concept of small economies, as her country was also a small island economy subject to climate hazards such as Hurricane George which had, about a month ago, devastated Haiti, Cuba and the Dominican Republic. Conditions adding to the vulnerability of small economies included: high                                                                                     WT/COMTD/M/22                                                                                            Page 17 dependence on a few markets and few commodities, difficulties in developing the export sector, high cost of transport because of remoteness and heavy reliance on agricultural product commodities.","WTCOMTDm22.pdf","Dominican, Republic, Bolivia, Haiti, Cuba, Dominican, Republic"

She fully agreed with the statement made by Mauritius, Jamaica and Barbados. Her delegation was aware of the diversity that existed amongst the small island states, which were similarly affected by the same factors i.e., small size, small domestic markets, dependence on imports, heavy reliance on a few commodities and a few markets, vulnerability to natural disasters, fragility of eco-systems, constraints on transport and communications and a high level of migration of their skilled nationals. It was vital to stress that per capita income was not an adequate measure of the level of development of a country. Furthermore, it was necessary for the WTO to take account of handicaps faced by small economies to prevent the marginalization of these economies in the globalizing economy.","WTCOMTDm22.pdf","Trinidad, Tobago, Mauritius, Jamaica, Barbados, WTO"
"1606",1606,"81","81.     She also drew attention to the fact that the joint paper listed organizations and institutions which had undertaken studies on small economies and small island states. In this regard, her delegation highlighted the on-going work at UNCTAD in support of the Programme of Action adopted at the Global Conference for the Sustainable Development of Small Island Developing States. Her delegation strongly welcomed UNCTAD's cooperation with the alliance of Small Island States – a group of about 40 small island and low-lying coastal developing countries. Her delegation requested that the conclusions of UNCTAD in this area should be fed into the deliberations and work of the WTO.

Her delegation was deeply concerned with the marginalization of small economies. She urged Members of the Committee to urgently address the issue. Sri Lanka associated fully with the position expressed by Mauritius and other co-sponsors to the paper, and supported by many other speakers. The positions taken by these Members fully addressed the concerns of small economies under the current multilateral trading system. The situation of small economies was unique. They neither qualified for the special programmes for LDCs nor were they fully representative and covered in the situation that prevailed in other developing countries. For instance, FDI in these countries were at low levels because of the small size of their domestic markets and absence of well-developed infrastructures. Furthermore, these countries were heavily dependent on few primary exports for their foreign exchange earnings. Small economies had several specific problems which impeded their meaningful participation in the multilateral trading system.","WTCOMTDm22.pdf","Sri, Lanka, Committee, Members, Committee, Sri, Lanka, Mauritius, Members, LDCs"

Although Sri Lanka was founder Member of the GATT since 1947, the benefits that it had been able to derive from the trading system were questionable because of inherent problems confronted by Sri Lanka since the inception of the GATT. The recent financial crisis amply WT/COMTD/M/22 Page 18 demonstrated the limited extent to which countries could deal with external shocks even if they adopted ""correct"" macroeconomic policies. Many of the small economies were liberalizing their countries autonomously. They were also under tremendous pressure and burden to fulfill their obligations and commitments under various WTO Agreements. In spite of their peculiar and inherent weaknesses, small economies were required to proceed at the same speed as other developing countries. Her delegation was of the strong view that the problems of small economies needed special attention; and their unique problems required more practical solutions in order for them to able to reverse the current trends.","WTCOMTDm22.pdf","Sri, Lanka, Member, GATT, Sri, Lanka, GATT, WTO"

He hoped that the document would provide a basis for constructive discussions. The issues in the paper were of crucial importance to Lesotho, and were directly linked to the efforts of his country to actively participate in the multilateral trading system. For instance, erratic and severe climatic conditions exerted considerable pressure on Lesotho's limited resources. With the limited support for small economies and LDCs, his delegation took the view that special consideration of these economies was necessary if they were to achieve full integration of their economies into the multilateral trading system. To conclude, his delegation welcomed earlier positive comments, under the preceding agenda item, for the increased and focused technical assistance for LDCs.","WTCOMTDm22.pdf","Lesotho, Lesotho, Lesotho, Lesotho, LDCs"

The paper was interesting and contained detailed contributions to a subject which was a source of concern to WTO Ministers at the 2nd Ministerial Conference. Paragraph 6 of the Declaration of the 2nd Ministerial Conference testified to the importance that the WTO Ministers attached to the subject. Her delegation felt that amongst developing countries there were characteristics that set apart small economies. Some were identifiable through their structural vulnerability to external fluctuations, and had a low share of world trade. There were those subject to frequent devastating natural disasters, climatic changes, hurricanes, such as those that had affected El Salvador. Her delegation felt that the item should remain on the agenda of the CTD so that discussions could continue and evolve at subsequent meetings.","WTCOMTDm22.pdf","El, Salvador, WTO, WTO, El, Salvador, CTD"

His delegation took the view that difficulties presented by different developing countries should be recognized by the COMMITTEE and effectively addressed. The paper would be carefully studied. However, as a preliminary comment, the problems identified in the paper were similar to those faced by LDC's, also similar to general problems facing developing countries. However, it appeared that some of these problems were specific to small economies. His delegation was keen to further discussion of this item at a later stage.","WTCOMTDm22.pdf","Egypt, LDC"
"1612",1612,"87","87.      The representative of Bangladesh commended the co-sponsors for the paper circulated on ""Concerns and Problems of Small Economies"". The paper had just been received. Therefore, only general comments could be made at this time. First, the paper had introduced a new set of interesting indicators of underdevelopment, distinct from the usual and universally accepted indicator of per capita income. Second, the paper employed physical features and market characteristics in defence of its case for ""so called small economies"". The explicit attempt to re-define underdevelopment and marginalization in terms of these new indicators and features, opened the door for new interpretations which may shift the focus of the international community away from the effects of marginalization that already affected the 48 recognized LDCs. Further elaborate comments would be made after a closer examination of the paper.","WTCOMTDm22.pdf","Bangladesh"
"1613",1613,"88","88.     For the record, however, the representative of Bangladesh noted that the co-sponsors justified the rationale for the case for small economies from paragraph 6 of the 2nd WTO Ministerial Declaration. However, his delegation underlined the fact that the reference in the 2nd WTO                                                                                     WT/COMTD/M/22                                                                                            Page 19 Ministerial Declaration to small economies was exclusively in the context of the ""marginalization of least-developed countries"". In the absence of the context of LDCs, the concern for small economies ""lost most of its validity"". Furthermore, his delegation emphasised that the 2nd WTO Ministerial Declaration referred to ""certain small economies"" and not all small economies as had been presented by the paper in circulation. The circulated paper had severed its link to the contextual reference because it had omitted the word ""certain"". His delegation reserved its right to return to the item at a later stage.","WTCOMTDm22.pdf","Bangladesh, WTO, WTO, WTO"

The representative of Tanzania drew attention to the high importance to all Members of the item and commended the co-sponsors of the paper on ""Concerns and Problems of Small Economies"". The paper had just been received, therefore, his delegation's comments, at this time, would only be preliminary. Tanzania, as a Member of the Commonwealth, was participating in the Commonwealth discussions on the same item. The case for the small economies to be accorded special consideration was strong. The case had been well argued and deserved the sympathy of Members. While it was a fact that a number of these countries had higher GDP per capita than most of the LDCs, for instance Jamaica's whose GDP per capita and export earnings were twice plus that of Tanzania, yet the special nature of these countries had to be recognized. This special nature included their vulnerabilities, their remote location and smallness.","WTCOMTDm22.pdf","Tanzania, Members, Tanzania, Member, Commonwealth, Commonwealth, Members, LDCs, Jamaica, Tanzania"

He said that although LDCs also had difficulties, these were structural problems, problems related to infrastructure, under-utilisation of capacities, etc. However, the problem of LDCs were of a transitional nature. It was expected that over time, LDCs would surmount their difficulties. In contrast, the peculiarity of the problems of small economies lay in the fact of their location and their small size. The problems confronting the small economies appeared to be beyond their capacities. The case for the special consideration for small economies was, therefore, strong and Tanzania would support their case.","WTCOMTDm22.pdf","LDCs, LDCs, LDCs, Tanzania"
"1617",1617,"91","91.     The representative of Tanzania stated that what was required was to identify practical ways in which these concerns could be incorporated into the WTO; and assess the impact of any practical measures of assistance on the development and the economies of these small economies. After such practical measures (action package) were undertaken, it would also be useful to know what extra impact such practical steps would have on some of the small economies that were already LDCs, such as Lesotho. In doing so, his delegation underscored the vital importance of taking account of the statements made by some of the delegations of the small economies themselves, particularly those by Jamaica and Barbados. These delegations had said that, whatever assistance sought by small economies should be without prejudice to the problems of or assistance to LDCs. On this point, the representative of Tanzania shared a common position with the representative of Bangladesh. This position was further recently affirmed by the distinguished Minister of Barbados, at the head of a delegation that was addressing the matter of the concerns and problems of small economies, and who had said: ""We pointed out that small states did not seek recognition of their special circumstances in ways which could prejudice assistance to the LDCs"". The representative of Tanzania said that whatever package of practical support the WTO put together for small economies, it would be necessary to take account of the position of non-prejudice to LDCs.","WTCOMTDm22.pdf","Tanzania, WTO, Lesotho, Jamaica, Barbados, Tanzania, Bangladesh, Barbados, Tanzania, WTO"

The representative of Tanzania suggested that either the Committee, a specialized committee or a working group should be established to work out a set of practical measures and steps for assisting small economies. His delegation believed that any supportive measure or set of measures taken to benefit any category of developing countries would in the long-run benefit all developing countries, including LDCs. His delegation reserved the right to return to the item at a later stage.","WTCOMTDm22.pdf","Tanzania, Committee"
"1619",1619,"93","93.     The representative of Haiti associated his delegation with the joint paper by the six co-sponsors on ""Concerns and Problems of Small Economies"", for three reasons. First, Haiti became an LDC after having been a small island developing economy, structurally weak and WT/COMTD/M/22 Page 20 vulnerable. Second, Haiti did not want to see what happened to it, happen to other small island developing economies. Following the current trends of the world economy, these small island developing economies were potential LDCs. At the beginning of the 1980s there were only 26 LDCs, less than 20 years later, there were now 48 LDCs. This meant that with increasing globalization, the number of LDCs was increasing. If the WTO did not address the concerns of these small economies, these small economies would soon be listed as LDCs. WTO Trade Ministers at the 2nd Ministerial Conference had expressed their concern over the marginalization of LDCs and certain small economies. They recognized that this matter should be urgently addressed more so because the peculiar problems of these economies had been compounded by the problem of chronic debt. As a WTO Member and as an LDC, Haiti would like to ensure that the WTO should respond to the best of its ability to the concerns expressed by Ministers, as set out in the Declaration by the Ministers at the 2nd WTO Ministerial Conference. Irrespective of their scale of contributions, attention should be accorded to the problems of LDCs and small economies at all times.","WTCOMTDm22.pdf","Haiti, Haiti, Haiti, WTO, WTO, WTO, Member, LDC, Haiti, WTO, WTO, Ministerial, Conference"
"1620",1620,"94","94.      The representative of Bolivia acknowledged the commendation and tribute of the representatives of Jamaica and the Dominican Republic. In the real world of the multilateral trading system, small economies and other Members operated in a rule-based system. Small economies desired full participation in drawing up the rules which would govern commercial behaviour. Small economies were concerned that colleagues from LDCs had expressed so many fears. It appeared that small economies represented a danger that could arise from the diversion of attention away from LDCs. Her delegation considered that there was no competition for attention. A truly multilateral system should be able to respond to the interests of all the components of the system, particularly if such a system desired to be considered a credible system. Her delegation was deeply satisfied that this item was being addressed in the Committee. She requested that the item should be constantly retained on the agenda of the Committee. The item was not a new one. For instance, the problem had been very clearly referred to in the Committee on Subsidies and Countervailing Duties. Her delegation was convinced that a common denominator could be found to enable the Committee forge a definition which the small economies would feel correctly identified them. The aspirations of small economies should not only be concentrated on technical cooperation, which was important, but also focused on other factors which would assist the integration of small economies in the multilateral trading system. There were several examples such as the safeguarding of export opportunities, early detection of non-tariff barriers and market access for the limited exports of small economies.","WTCOMTDm22.pdf","Bolivia, Jamaica, Dominican, Republic, Members, LDCs, LDCs, Committee, Committee, Committee, Committee"
"1621",1621,"95","95.     She supported the position by several delegations that the jointly circulated paper was valuable. It had established a good basis for work on the item in the Committee.

"1622",1622,"96","96.      The representative of Cuba supported the joint paper on ""Concerns and Problems of Small Economies"". His delegation was familiar with the difficulties raised in the paper. It was necessary that the problems of the small economies should be accorded special consideration and treatment to enable them participate effectively in the multilateral trading system. The paper provided a good basis not only for the discussions in the Committee but also for the recommendations that would be evolved to meet the needs of these countries.","WTCOMTDm22.pdf","Cuba, Committee"
"1623",1623,"97","97.      The representative of Guatemala said that he shared many of the points set out in the paper circulated on the Concerns and Problems of Small Economies. He felt it was justified that the Committee should keep the item on its agenda and consider it constantly because the Committee was charged with considering issues of trade and development in the multilateral trading system. His delegation recalled the concerns expressed by Trade Ministers in paragraph 6 of the 2nd WTO Ministerial Conference on the marginalization of certain small economies, and the urgency of addressing these concerns at the WTO. This was why his delegation felt it necessary to analyze the different aspects of the problems and the concerns expressed by the Ministers. In this connection, the                                                                                        WT/COMTD/M/22                                                                                               Page 21 representative of Guatemala said that his delegation would circulate a paper in the future. Nonetheless, it should be borne in mind that several organizations had already undertaken useful work on the subject of small economies. These organizations included Economic Commission for Latin America, the Organization of American States and the World Bank. In Latin America, work had also being undertaken on small economies within the purview of regionalization. Therefore, all the studies that had been carried out and which were still underway should be useful not only within the regional context, but also at the multilateral level to enable the WTO tackle this issue. Each small economy represented a series of different characteristics which pointed to the urgency of taking into account the needs of small developing economies within the WTO.","WTCOMTDm22.pdf","Guatemala, Committee, Committee, WTO, WTO, Guatemala, Economic, Commission, for, Latin, America, Organization, of, American, States, World, Bank, Latin, America, WTO, WTO"
"1624",1624,"98","98.      The representative said that small economies had certain economic and structural characteristics which make them more vulnerable to external fluctuations in both production and demand. He re-iterated the point by earlier speakers that the trade of small economies depended on the exports of certain limited number of commodities. Their trade was non-diversified in structure, and did not represent a significant percentage of world trade. However, small economies were highly dependent on international trade. Furthermore, infrastructure was limited and the domestic markets were small. As widely known, many of the small economies were vulnerable to climatic disasters and hazards, such as recently tragically demonstrated by the hurricanes George and Mitch, as well as forest fires. Many of these small economies, therefore, had difficulties in drawing benefits from the multilateral trading system. As a consequence, the WTO had to be creative in evolving positive mechanisms which would assist small economies in fully participating and drawing benefits from the trading system; and also enable small economies to close the gap that separated them from other countries. Small economies must use their resources, their creativity and individual capacities, as well as those of the international community to enable them realize their development aims and potential.","WTCOMTDm22.pdf","George, Mitch, WTO"
"1625",1625,"99","99.     The representative of Guatemala underscored the necessity of assistance to small economies.

The new paper circulated by his delegation (WT/COMTD/W/55) was meant to offer a Mauritian perspective and national experience on the problems and concerns of small economies. This paper elaborated on the concept of vulnerability. The paper was sub-divided into several categories. These were geography, remoteness from the main centres of trade with effects for cost of production and competitiveness, climatic conditions, etc. He elaborated various concerns relating to these factors, as mentioned in the paper. He hoped that Members would carefully examine the paper compiled by Mauritius, and that they would also study the national experiences of other small economies that would be presented in the CTD.","WTCOMTDM23.pdf","Mauritius, Corr, Members, Mauritius"

Five of the Forum's members were least developed countries, most members suffered from handicaps related to size or geographical isolation, and very few had representations in Geneva, even though 5 were WTO members and 3 were in the process of accession. The representative of Australia said that his country had worked closely with Forum members who had acceded to the WTO in the recent past or were in the process of acceding, and had provided a range of technical assistance to these countries. He concluded by saying that the granting of Observer Status to the Forum would be very much in the interests of its members and also of the WTO.","WTCOMTDM23.pdf","Australia, Secretariat, South, Pacific, Geneva, WTO, Australia, WTO, WTO"

The representative of Egypt repeated a proposal he had made in the informal meeting that the Informal Note clearly showed that Observer Status was granted on an ad hoc basis in other WTO bodies, and that requests in the CTD should be treated similarly until the General Council had completed its work on guidelines for the granting of Observer Status. He noted that several applicants had been awaiting a decision for a long time, and that it would be inappropriate to delay their application further by requesting additional information. He proposed that applicant organisations be invited to attend on an ad hoc basis, and that any requests for further information be made in the course of their ad hoc observer status. Noting that Observer Status was usually renewed on a meeting-by-meeting basis, any organisation that failed to meet the attendance obligation could have their status as Observer revoked.","WTCOMTDM23.pdf","Egypt, WTO, CTD, General, Council"

He said that as far as other organisations were concerned, more information was required, especially with regard to their links to trade issues. The Committee should be careful to avoid arguments that could be used to obtain Observer Status elsewhere in the WTO , and should not neglect the systemic impact of its decisions. Reacting to the proposal made by Egypt, the representative of the European Communities said his delegation agreed that more information was required of applicants.

"1648",1648,"11","11.     The representative of Lesotho recalled that Lesotho was both an LDC and a small economy. Recalling the working paper WT/COMTD/W/50 and Corr.1 of which his delegation was a co- sponsor, he highlighted the following factors of vulnerability in Lesotho's economy.         (a)     a land-locked state: Lesotho was within the boundaries of South Africa, with                 transportation links that go through South Africa. For instance, the nearest port was                 600 kms away at Durban. This factor translated into high import costs and unit costs                 of production;         (b)     harsh climatic factors: the El Nino phenomenon had affected the pattern of rainfall,                 with adverse effects for agriculture. In a total land area of 30,350 square kilometers,                 only 9 per cent of the land was arable;                                                                                    WT/COMTD/M/23                                                                                            Page 3         (c)     crop failures: the South African Food Security Technical Assistance Unit had noted                 that Lesotho should import 301,000 tonnes of cereal to compensate for the shortfall                 in 1997-98. The Food and Agricultural Organization had also forecast a sharp                 increase in cereal imports from the 1997-98 level. As a result of crop failures, the                 Government had considered extraordinary support for farmers such as free or                 subsidized tractor services and provision of fertilizers;         (d)     limited options: Lesotho's natural resources were scarce. The principal natural                 resources of Lesotho were water and the people;         (e)     remittances from migrant workers: This was a strong link to the economy of South                 Africa. Migrant worker remittances accounted for about 40 per cent of GDP.                 However, these remittances had been declining from 1993 due to retrenchment of                 workers by South Africa. IMF data suggests a declining trend of such remittances to                 about 29 per cent in the period 1998-99. This was a further illustration of Lesotho's                 vulnerability to economic developments in South Africa;         (f)     small industrial base: Lesotho's potential was limited by various factors. The                 domestic market was small with a total population of approximately 2.1 million,                 widely dispersed in the rural areas; there was heavy reliance on imported raw                 materials and finished goods, hence a large import bill; and Lesotho could not secure                 a significant export market, resulting in more imports than exports. Economic                 difficulties were largely based on Lesotho's small industrial base, and limited product                 diversification;         (g)     Fluctuations of commodity prices: Lesotho exported mainly wool and mohair.                 However, export earnings from these were unpredictable because of frequent changes                 in commodity prices. Lesotho was a pricetaker on world markets, with adverse                 effects for FDI.","WTCOMTDM23.pdf","Lesotho, Lesotho, Corr, Lesotho, Lesotho, South, Africa, South, Africa, Durban, El, Nino, South, African, Food, Security, Technical, Assistance, Unit, Lesotho, Food, and, Agricultural, Organization, Lesotho, Lesotho, South, Africa, South, Africa, IMF, Lesotho, South, Africa, Lesotho, Lesotho, Lesotho, Lesotho, Lesotho"

"1660",1660,"13","13.      The representative of Fiji, introducing the paper by his delegation (WT/COMTD/W/54) supported the statement by Mauritius on behalf of small economies. He highlighted the geographical features of Fiji; its commitment to the WTO agenda, principles and disciplines; vulnerability factors; the export sectors of sugar, canned tuna and garments; the importance of preferences; and the cost of adjustment to Fiji. He re-affirmed Fiji's commitment to the WTO agenda of trade liberalization and recognized the benefits that global economic integration could bring. However, there were specific difficulties particularly in small island economies which posed serious limitations on trade liberalization undertakings. He drew attention to several vulnerability factors that were unique to small island economies. These included: limited natural resources, small labour force, geographical fragmentation, remoteness from major markets and susceptibility to natural disasters, such as flooding and hurricanes, which were typical features of most islands in the South Pacific. He emphasized the importance of three product areas: sugar, canned tuna and garments, and stressed the importance of preferences as well as the elimination of trade restrictions for these products. The erosion of Fiji's trade preferences by the gradual dismantling of preferential trade agreements posed a real threat to its survival. Fiji was exploring alternative strategies to secure foreign exchange earnings with minimum social disruption, but this would take time. At this stage and given the peculiarities of a small island economy, Fiji could not efficiently trade on the global market without preferences, particularly those afforded under the Sugar Protocol of the Lomé Convention and with Australia under SPARTECA.

"1661",1661,"14","14.      The representative of Fiji underscored the importance of financial assistance to least- developed and small economies to sustain costs of adjustment. His delegation was not against globalization and liberalization, but against the pace with which the process was dictated by the developed economies, through the various multilateral institutions and instruments, including international financial institutions. In the view of his delegation, equity and justice were absent in the manner of application and the pace of trade liberalization. He strongly supported the debate within the WTO and its Member countries concerning the difficulties that vulnerable developing countries faced in the current pace of trade liberalization. He hoped that as a result of this awareness and debate, some positive action would ensue in the immediate future. To this end, his delegation requested that the CTD should, as a special and targeted effort, accord priority to the development of an acceptable framework within the jurisdiction of the WTO to address the concerns of least- developed and small vulnerable states with the objective of enabling them to to undertake and complete trade liberalization policies at a pace sensitive to their different stages of developments and susceptibility to climatic hazards.","WTCOMTDM23.pdf","Fiji, WTO, Member, CTD, WTO"

These statements demonstrated that small economies had physical, structural and institutional characteristics which affected the processes of economic growth, inhibited their ability to compete, increased their vulnerability to external events, and limited their capacity for adjustment. Her delegation would also circulate a country paper on Barbados elaborating its characteristics as a small economy. In the interim, statistics would be presented to show the geographical features and circumstances of Barbados.","WTCOMTDM23.pdf","Barbados, Barbados, Barbados"
"1663",1663,"16","16.     Barbados was an island state situated in the Caribbean hurricane belt. Its total land area was 266,000 sq.km. Foreign exchange earning sectors were limited to tourism and international business services. The country's trade flows, were concentrated in two to three main markets. This market dependence was a source of vulnerability, since the growth of export trade was linked to the performance of the markets. Regarding transportation, Barbados had only one airport and 30 cargo ships which served its trading needs.","WTCOMTDM23.pdf","Barbados, Caribbean, Barbados"
"1664",1664,"17","17.      She noted that the effect of small size was recognized in national economic policies. Most countries had policies specifically designed to promote the viability of small businesses or enterprises. It followed that this policy should also be applied to the global economic arena in the context of multilateral trade agreements. The multilateral trading system had to respond to the needs of all participating countries; the full participation of small states in the multilateral trading system was critical to their economic development. Different countries had different needs which had to be recognized and accommodated. Effective participation in the multilateral trading system was not a zero sum game for the world's trading partners. In this connection, her delegation welcomed and commended the measures by Mauritius, a small economy, to offer duty free access to a certain number of products originating from LDCs.","WTCOMTDM23.pdf","Mauritius"

She recalled the position stated by her delegation at the 22nd Session of the CTD that ""the application of the rules governing the multilateral trading system must not be insensitive to the imperative of equitable international development"". In this regard, her delegation affirmed that improved special and differential treatment provisions in WTO Agreements were needed for all developing countries, including LDCs and small economies.","WTCOMTDM23.pdf","CTD, WTO"
"1666",1666,"19","19.     The representative of the Dominican Republic concurred with the views expressed by previous speakers. The Dominican Republic was also a small and vulnerable economy with specific needs. These needs had already been extensively stated by previous speakers. They should be studied and addressed in the WTO, having in mind the preparations for the 3rd WTO Ministerial Conference.

The Chairman of the Sub-Committee on Least-Developed Countries (SCLDC) informed the CTD that the Sub-Committee had decided to forward two Secretariat documents to the General Council through the CTD. The documents were WT/COMTD/LDC/W/10 entitled ""Implementation of WTO Agreements: Survey of the Difficulties Faced by Least-Developed Countries and the Current Response"" of 19 October 1998, and WT/COMTD/LDC/W/11/Rev.1 ""Market Access for Exports of Goods and Services of the Least-Developed Countries: Barriers and Constraints"" of 26 October 1998. The revision of the Market Access document contained information about the recently notified market access offers made by the delegations of Mauritius and the United States.

"1668",1668,"20","20.      The representative of Guatemala stated (WT/COMTD/W/56) that the benefits from participation in the multilateral trading system were not as significant for small developing economies as for others. To reap the benefits of the system, there was the need to re-adjust some internal policies. At the same time, international cooperation had been boosted to substantially improve the preparedness of small economies to participate in the ambitious opening up process, and to negotiate and implement WTO commitments.","WTCOMTDM23.pdf","Guatemala, WTO"
"1669",1669,"21","21.      Guatemala's low level of development was reflected in its low productive capacity, which limited Guatemala's capacity to achieve its objectives under the WTO. While a substantial agricultural sector existed, with adequate production commensurate to the country's manpower, there was a lower level of urbanization and insufficient development of the educational sector. Thus, the country was less prepared structurally for, and had a limited understanding of, the imperatives of the multilateral trading system. International trade was changing rapidly and small economies had difficulties in implementing and complying with commitments under WTO rules. This was further complicated by negotiation of new commitments. Internally, some were unprepared to face the challenges of the liberalization process. For instance, fiscal income in small economies depended more than in larger economies on external trade, and could only sustain a low level of external reserves. Weaknesses of small developing economies were intensified by heavy dependence on external funding, higher levels of trade openness, concentration and vulnerability in the export sector, lack of economies of scale, small internal consumption capacity, small markets, and limited influence on the structure of world prices.","WTCOMTDM23.pdf","Guatemala, Guatemala, WTO, WTO"
"1670",1670,"22","22.      In order to increase preparedness and the ability to share fully in the benefits offered by the multilateral trading system, it was clear that small developing economies must continue to apply sound macroeconomic policies, engage in efficient and rational resource allocation, and undertake appropriate institutional changes as well as improve the quality of education. This approach would enhance the opening-up of their trade, especially in the agricultural sector. The technological base had to be improved by obtaining more and newer forms of technology, and public management had to be improved. However, internal policies were insufficient to improve the level of international preparedness of small economies. International cooperation was vital and had to be enhanced. The effects of low investment due to geographical, social and economic drawbacks had to be offset. Incentives had to be provided for intra-regional investment in small economies. The development of processing industries required to be boosted. Transfer of technology was crucial. Effective and continuous market access for products of export interest for small economies was also important. In this regard, discriminatory rules of origin against products and exports from small economies had to be eliminated. The type of mechanisms that should be adopted for achieving globalization and assisting small developing economies, within the multilateral trading system, to raise their level of development, and share of the benefits from the trading system, was an open question. His country understood that continued development depended on solid and consistent policies, sustainable development and a dynamic private sector. However, the key to prosperity depended on a constant flow of productive capital, elimination of obstacles to trade in goods and services, integration into and presence in the multilateral trading system.","WTCOMTDM23.pdf",""
"1671",1671,"23","23.      The representative of Egypt supported the CTD addressing the difficulties of small economies. For his delegation, two points stood out. First, was the hope, initially raised by the representative of Tanzania in the previous meeting, that LDCs would exit the LDC category as quickly as possible. His delegation was fully associated with that hope. However, what was being noted in the statements being made on the current item were the specific difficulties that were being confronted by small economies. His delegation was convinced that more focus on the issues and difficulties facing both LDCs and small economies. Lesotho, both as an LDC and a small economy, reflected some problems common to both. The CTD should focus particularly on those trade-related problems and how they can be meaningfully addressed in the WTO. Second, a recurring issue in the discussions, so far, was the impact of the relationship between the smallness of the economies, their WT/COMTD/M/23 Page 6 vulnerability, and their competitiveness (or lack of it) in an international environment. His delegation considered that this could be an interesting and specific approach to further explore, and to study in greater detail, possibly on the basis of a paper to be prepared by the Secretariat. This approach could encompass the question of the impact of smallness, remoteness and the vulnerability of small economies on the competitiveness of the production of these economies and their trade situation. To conclude, his delegation re-emphasised the importance of addressing the difficulties of small economies, and re-expressed the hope that there would be specific and practical recommendations to address the problems raised.","WTCOMTDM23.pdf","Egypt, CTD, Tanzania, LDCs, Lesotho, CTD, WTO, Secretariat"
"1672",1672,"24","24.      The representative of El Salvador agreed with previous speakers that the problems and difficulties of small economies should be addressed. Although her delegation supported trade liberalization, it should be properly paced according to the levels of economic development. She supported the position expressed by the representative of Egypt regarding a document to be prepared that would contain, inter alia, practical recommendations to address the problems of small economies.","WTCOMTDM23.pdf","El, Salvador, Egypt"
"1673",1673,"25","25.      The representative of Tanzania made preliminary comments focused on document WT/COMTD/W/50. He recognized the problems identified by small economies. These problems had a negative impact on the trade viability of the economies in question. Natural and environmental disasters had catastrophic effects on these economies. However, he said that his delegation would have been more at ease if the document had been offered more clarity on the concept of small economies. The paper addressed the problems of small economies in a broad sense whereas paragraph 6 of the Declaration of the 2nd Ministerial Conference had only referred to ""certain small economies"". Nonetheless, the WTO should recognize the problems of small economies and address these problems. At the same time, certain issues in the paper were debatable. In this regard, his delegation cautioned on the criteria for measuring or assessing the level of development as suggested in paragraph 3 of the paper. He also hoped that small economies would support the initiative to establish an independent foundation to reduce the high costs in the use of the WTO dispute settlement system. Finally, he hoped that issues raised in the paper could be addressed within the framework of WTO provisions, as suggested in paragraph 23 of the paper.","WTCOMTDM23.pdf","Tanzania, WTO, WTO, WTO"
"1674",1674,"26","26.     The representative of Morocco recalled that one of the cardinal objectives of the WTO was to achieve the integration of all states into the multilateral trading system, in particular developing countries which were at risk of marginalization. He was aware of the problems raised for small economies largely because of the vicissitudes of climate, geography and economy. His delegation was prepared to address the problems raised by small economies within the CTD and in other bodies of the WTO. Small economies had specific problems to be addressed. It was evident that all developing countries encountered difficulties with respect to their integration into the multilateral trading system. He suggested that account could be taken of the proposals being made by sponsors of the item through special and differential treatment provisions, as suggested by Barbados. The problems could also be addressed through technical cooperation projects and other positive measures. For instance, the elimination of market access restrictions would be one of the positive measures that could be undertaken. It could also be possible to request the Secretariat to produce an analytical paper, as suggested by Egypt.","WTCOMTDM23.pdf","Morocco, WTO, CTD, WTO, Barbados, Secretariat, Egypt"
"1675",1675,"27","27.     The representative of Brazil stated its sensitivity to the problems of small economies. He welcomed the proposal to consider the item in the CTD. The difficulties raised should be addressed not only by the WTO but also by other international organizations which focused on development and financial matters. Within the framework of the CTD, his delegation considered that the examination of the item could follow a two-track approach, firstly, by further refining the concept of small economies in order to determine its conceptual fit with the rules-based system of the WTO, and secondly, as suggested by the Egyptian delegation, by discussing technical aspects of specific problems of the small economies and how these problems could be addressed by WTO technical cooperation and assistance.

"1676",1676,"28","28.      The representative of the United States stated its support for discussions in the CTD on the concerns and problems of small economies. Her delegation was sensitive to the problems of small economies and further recognized that every WTO Member had specific concerns related to its situation in size, income level, geographic location and other characteristics. The United States was mindful of the critical value that WTO-consistent preferences play for all developing countries, in particular LDCs, including small economies. In this regard, the United States had contributed enormously and would continue to do so in a WTO-consistent manner. In addition, the United States had also contributed to hurricane struck economies, such as the economies that had been devastated by Hurricane Mitch. However, she shared the position of Brazil regarding some of the proposals that had been made. Proposals for addressing the problems of small economies, including specific proposals for assistance had to be considered within the framework of the rule-based system and the balance of rights and obligations for Members. Proposals could also be considered within the framework of WTO technical assistance programmes.","WTCOMTDM23.pdf","United, States, CTD, WTO, Member, United, States, United, States, United, States, Mitch, Brazil, Members, WTO"
"1677",1677,"29","29.      The representative of Bolivia expressed satisfaction that this item was being addressed in the CTD. Its treatment demonstrated the concern of several Members for the problems of small economies. He recalled paragraph 2 of the preamble to the Marrakesh Agreement, which recognized that positive efforts should be made to ensure that developing countries, including the least-developed amongst them would secure a share in the growth of world trade commensurate with the needs of their economic development. He stressed some of the economic and trade difficulties faced by small economies like Bolivia. These included a non-diversified economic base, with considerable dependence on foreign trade; vulnerability to price fluctuations on international markets; effects of trade-dependency on domestic macroeconomic policies; major access problems in markets for their small- and medium-sized businesses; and, in Bolivia's case, serious economic consequences resulting from being land-locked. Recent studies had demonstrated that the present prejudice against Bolivia as a result of its lack of access to the sea totalled US$4 billion per decade, an amount equivalent to the total foreign debt. To improve the participation of small economies in international trade, a shared effort had to be made by all WTO Members. To this end, his delegation welcomed the proposals by the representative of Egypt that the item should be considered in the CTD on the basis of a Secretariat analysis. Technical assistance was an extremely important element, which was useful in capacity- building and in strengthening domestic trade policy institutions. Nevertheless, technical assistance was not a solution to all problems and the key matter to be addressed was improved market access for small economies.","WTCOMTDM23.pdf","Bolivia, CTD, Members, Bolivia, Bolivia, Bolivia, WTO, Members, Egypt, CTD, Secretariat"

Ambassador Bruun noted that the SCLDC had agreed to ask the Secretariat to prepare two non-papers, on the Secretariat's own responsibility, each containing a short structured list of the main points that emerged during the Sub-Committee's discussions of the two papers. Those lists would accompany the documents to assist further discussions under the aegis of the General Council. In accordance with of the terms of reference of the Sub-Committee, which required the Sub-Committee to report to the Committee on Trade and Development for consideration and appropriate action, the matter was being referred to the CTD for formal referral to the General Council.","WTCOMTDM23.pdf","Ambassador, Bruun, Secretariat, Secretariat, General, Council, Committee, on, Trade, and, Development, CTD, General, Council"
"1679",1679,"30","30.      The representative of the European Communities congratulated Mauritius on its paper. His delegation attached great importance to the concerns and problems of small economies and would study the issues raised in the document very closely. The document showed that the concerned and affected economies deserved sympathy. Efforts should be made to enable these economies to fully participate in the multilateral trading system. His delegation believed that it was important to retain the item on the agenda and continue with the discussions not only in the CTD, but also in other Committees which might discuss some of the ideas generated in the discussions on the item in the CTD. Nonetheless, it was important to ensure that the discussions should stay focused on trade. In this connection, it seemed that some of the issues raised went beyond issues that could be addressed, or redressed, either in the CTD specifically or at the WTO generally. This did not imply foreclosing the debate on these issues that were not trade focused, but rather that all Members should not entertain too-high expectations given the vast spectrum of problems that had been raised. Against this background, he suggested that the first step should not be to request a note from the Secretariat on the issue, but rather for the delegations which had begun analytical work to be more precise as to what the consequences would be. For instance, precision was required as to the areas where technical assistance was required. Furthermore, the starting-point was and had to be the relationship to the rule-based multilateral trading system. In this connection, he agreed with the views expressed by the representative of Brazil. More discussions were required because he was not certain that the Secretariat could produce a background on the basis of the exchange of views so far.

"1680",1680,"31","31.      The representative emphasised the issue of the categories of countries. The High-Level Meeting for Least-Developed Countries (HLM) had taken place from 27 to 28 October 1997. The focus and emphasis of the HLM were still fresh in the minds of Members. Confusion should not be created by an over-emphasis on different categories of countries. It would be difficult to encompass all the criteria that had been identified under one common denominator. His delegation was open to this attempt, but doubted the possibility. It was important to bear in mind that initiatives already existed which needed follow-up and implementation. He also reminded Members that productive discussions on technical assistance were underway, and urged Members not to divert attention from these discussions, at a stage where discussions were also on-going on evaluation, and to venture into other new aspects of WTO technical assistance. He concluded that his delegation was fully aware of and sympathetic to, the issues but were unsure as to how they should be addressed in addition to the initiatives that were underway. However, his delegation was open to the maintenance of the item on the agenda and the continued discussion of the issues raised, including how initiatives or solutions which were proposed would fit into the rule-based multilateral trading system both in the CTD and in other Committees with related competencies.","WTCOMTDM23.pdf","Members, Members, Members, WTO, CTD"

"1682",1682,"33","33.      Geography could not be changed; for example, very little could be done about the fact that a country was land-locked. Thus, it would be useful for countries to focus on things that could be changed. In this regard, he would highlight four points which were pertinent for the next stage of the discussion of this item in the CTD. First was the pace of liberalization, where some Members had pointed that it would be unfair to expect LDCs and small economies to maintain the same pace of liberalization as others. The pace of liberalization would translate into commitments in a rule-based system such as the WTO. Second was the issue of market access. A paper had been submitted to the Committee and the General Council by the Sub-Committee on Least-Developed Countries. It would be useful to consider the refinement of this paper, and in doing so, to take account of the concerns of small economies. It should be recognised that market access concerns were of tremendous importance to small economies and needed to be addressed at some point in time. Third was the issue of technical assistance. Although some Members had argued that technical assistance was not the whole answer, this, however, was not equivalent to discounting technical assistance altogether. The CTD had to focus on technical assistance in order to determine whether the normal channels of technical assistance and its format were enough for small economies, and thereby determine whether a refinement was necessary. Finally, his delegation agreed with other representatives that coordination with other organizations was essential. It was evident that the concerns and problems of small economies were tackled by other organizations apart from the WTO. He supported the proposal by the representative of Egypt for a Secretariat paper on the subject.","WTCOMTDM23.pdf","CTD, Members, WTO, Committee, General, Council, Members, CTD, WTO, Egypt, Secretariat"
"1683",1683,"34","34.     The representative of Nicaragua re-affirmed his delegation's support for, and commitment to, the multilateral trading system. Nicaragua was committed to the liberalization of its markets and to globalization. Serious commitments had been undertaken with expectations of obtaining benefits. These benefits were periodically or constantly threatened due to the size of Nicaragua's economy and the frequency of natural disasters. These factors further reduced the benefits that Nicaragua could draw from the multilateral trading system. This was why his delegation felt that the serious account should be taken of the needs that had been expressed by the small economies as the WTO began to prepare for the 3rd Ministerial Conference.","WTCOMTDM23.pdf","Nicaragua, Nicaragua, Nicaragua, Nicaragua, WTO"
"1684",1684,"35","35.     The representative of Japan considered it apparent that some concrete views were emerging in the discussions of the item. His delegation, similar to views expressed by previous delegations, understood, were sensitive to, and sympathised with, the condition of small economies. He                                                                                    WT/COMTD/M/23                                                                                            Page 9 appreciated the constructive suggestions by the representative of Egypt, which were worth considering. At the same time, his delegation shared the view expressed by the European Communities that the WTO was a rule-based Organization, and therefore efforts in the item under consideration should be focused on relevant issues. Furthermore, the points made by the representative of India were worth considering.","WTCOMTDM23.pdf","Japan, Egypt, WTO, India"
"1685",1685,"36","36.      He recalled that at the High-Level Meeting for LDCs in October 1997, there were 12 specific round-tables in which each country voluntarily presented its needs assessments. His delegation felt that this sort of self-focus in the determination of needs would be a good idea. In other words, small economies should produce their own needs assessments and identify in what areas these needs would be required. This model, used in the context of the HLM for LDCs, presented the possibility of a useful approach. In this regard, the paper by Mauritius was excellent. His delegation urged others to present their economic difficulties in a written form. These written needs analyses would assist the Secretariat in its own analysis. This approach would approximate the ""spirit of ownership"" which was indispensable for succeeding in development. He urged all small economies to develop this ""spirit of ownership"" of their development plans.","WTCOMTDM23.pdf","LDCs, LDCs, Mauritius, Secretariat"
"1686",1686,"37","37.     The representative of Switzerland shared the concerns of Members that had documented the vulnerability of the small economies to climatic and economic fluctuations. His delegation also understood the points made on the risks of marginalization which faced small countries other than the LDCs. His delegation was concerned about the marginalization of any country. It would be worthwhile to contribute to any effort in the WTO to reduce this risk. Recalling the views expressed by the European Communities, the CTD should focus on trade and development issues. In this regard, his delegation was uncertain as to the specific contributions the CTD could make on small economies. He was mindful of the possibility of the CTD dispersing its efforts in different directions which would ultimately reduce efforts that could be made in other areas such as in respect of LDCs, technical assistance reforms, etc. This did not imply that the concerns expressed by several small economies should not be taken seriously. On the contrary, the placement of the item on the agenda of the CTD showed that there was concern for, and accommodation of, their problems.","WTCOMTDM23.pdf","Switzerland, Members, WTO, CTD, CTD, CTD, CTD"
"1687",1687,"38","38.      He noted several conceptual issues. First, he supported the approach for proceeding as suggested by the representative of Brazil and others. If there was to be a Secretariat paper on the subject of small economies, it should focus on the trade dimension and what was possible within the rules-based multilateral trading system to alleviate the problems. Second was the dynamic concept of development. In this regard, the representative of India had correctly noted that the size of any economy was not a dynamic concept which could be changed. Nonetheless, his delegation supported the initiative by the representative of Mauritius, and hoped that it would not have a negative effect on the other items on the agenda of the CTD.","WTCOMTDM23.pdf","Brazil, Secretariat, India, Mauritius, CTD"
"1688",1688,"39","39.      The representative of Uruguay welcomed the paper on the concerns and problems of small economies. He encouraged others to detail their own national experiences. Following the suggestions by the representatives of the European Communities and India, his delegation would exclusively focus on trade issues. First, he recalled the Secretariat study on special and differential treatment in WTO Agreements. An important feature of special and differential treatment provisions was the longer transitional time-frames provided for small economies and for developing countries for them to adapt to or comply with the provisions of WTO Agreements. This provision was important. Market access was an equally important issue. In this connection, when ""special and differential"" provisions were introduced, the intention was to improve market access of developing countries in general. It was apparent to his delegation that market access was still incomplete. Market access was an important issue, and it would be a valuable contribution if the WTO could effectively improve market access conditions both for small economies and for developing countries in general.

He wanted to know if the document would not first be discussed in the CTD. Furthermore, regarding the non- paper to be prepared by the Secretariat on observations made by Members in the course of the SCLDC exchange of views on the market access paper, he wondered how this document would be prepared and how it would be submitted to the General Council.","WTCOMTDM23.pdf","Mexico, CTD, Secretariat, Members, General, Council"

The representative of Australia welcomed the papers and expressed appreciation to Mauritius, Guatemala, Fiji and others who had indicated that they would present papers on their specific national concerns and experiences. The papers so far were useful contributions that outlined specific concerns about their capacities to participate in and take advantage of trade liberalization and the multilateral framework of trade rules. His delegation agreed that the WTO should be sensitive to the individual development needs of its Members. This would require identifying particular problems faced by developing country WTO Members, and determining the scope for WTO action to respond to these problems. There was a role, therefore, for the CTD and the Sub-Committee on Least-Developed Countries in the discussions under this item. The papers currently before the CTD were timely reminders to focus the discussions on the specific concerns and circumstances of Members. Members needed to keep in mind the issues raised in the papers such as technical cooperation, trade facilitation, electronic commerce and the implementation of special and differential treatment provisions in WTO Agreements.","WTCOMTDM23.pdf","Australia, Mauritius, Guatemala, Fiji, WTO, Members, WTO, Members, WTO, CTD, CTD, Members, Members, WTO"
"1691",1691,"41","41.      His delegation had noted the re-affirmation that technical cooperation had to be needs driven. Full implementation of this principle would provide an avenue to respond to some of the concerns raised in WT/COMTD/W/50 and Corr.1. Nonetheless, his delegation recognized that there were other broad policy issues and discussions that would be required. In thinking about further work, his delegation agreed with the positions taken by Brazil, the European Communities, Switzerland and Uruguay namely, that it would be useful to focus on the trade dimension of the subject, the concerns, problems and issues raised; and then determine what could be done within the existing rules-based system.","WTCOMTDM23.pdf","Corr, Brazil, Switzerland, Uruguay"

She sought possible solutions, for instance, to ensure better and improved market access for small economies. She agreed with the representative of Morocco that special and differential treatment provisions should be used, and that the WTO should work with other international organizations on this objective. If a list of studies were drawn up on the concerns and problems of small economies, it would be obvious that the problems had been identified and actions/measures also proposed as solutions. It was now time for the CTD to find and agree to the appropriate mechanism to ensure that these actions are effectively applied. Countless documents and studies existed. Future WTO negotiations were approaching. Her delegation considered that the CTD should work together in partnership to ensure that solutions were found. There was a need to strengthen the resources and capacities of small economies so that they could participate more fully in the multilateral trading system.","WTCOMTDM23.pdf","Panama, Morocco, WTO, CTD, WTO, CTD"

Her delegation encouraged other Members to share their concerns, difficulties and problems with Members of the CTD. This was a very useful exercise. The proposals made in the course of the meeting were constructive. Proposals by Egypt, India and Brazil were all worth considering. Her delegation agreed that the consideration of the concerns and problems small economies should focus on the trade dimensions. Her delegation supported further work on the role of the CTD in addressing these problems.","WTCOMTDM23.pdf","Canada, Members, Members, CTD, Egypt, India, Brazil, CTD"

The representative of Barbados, speaking a second time, supported the proposal by Egypt and others, to request the Secretariat to prepare an analytical paper on issues relevant to the impact on trade of smallness and vulnerability. She proposed that the Secretariat should conclude the analytical paper within a short time-frame so that it could be used in the preparatory process for both the 3rd WTO Ministerial Conference and the next Round of negotiations. While her delegation agreed that some further brainstorming was necessary to clarify the issues, it was certain that Members, including her delegation, would cooperate for any clarification that would be required.

The representative of Mauritius expressed appreciation to all Members who had intervened, and particularly to those who had supported the concerns and problems of small economies. He joined the representative of Barbados in supporting the proposal by Egypt. Before the next meeting, his delegation, after consultations with other Members, intended to outline how they saw the process evolving. His delegation sought the assistance of the Secretariat in guiding the CTD on this item. Against the background of his experience as former Chairman of the CTD, the representative of Mauritius assured the representative of Switzerland that the evolution of work under the item on small economies was intended to benefit the CTD.","WTCOMTDM23.pdf","Mauritius, Members, Barbados, Egypt, Members, Secretariat, CTD, Chairman, CTD, Mauritius, Switzerland, CTD"

He recalled that at the Informal Consultations of the CTD on 23 November, Members, in preliminary reactions, had welcomed the paper and expressed satisfaction with its scope and content. While expressing their wish to further analyze the paper, Members had emphasised, inter alia, the fine balance in the paper between the potential benefits of electronic commerce and the problems faced by developing countries.","WTCOMTDM23.pdf","Chairman, Secretariat, Development, Implications, of, Electronic, Commerce, CTD, Members, Members"

He welcomed the paper for its usefulness. In the view of his delegation, the essential issue raised in the paper was the need to build up capacity in developing countries so that they could use the opportunities presented by e-commerce as a means of conducting and facilitating trade. It was evident that e-commerce offered potential benefits for developing countries. These potential benefits were well set out in the Paper. However, what his delegation found most important was the description of what governments in developing countries should do to enhance the use of the internet. In this regard, he highlighted some of the issues discussed in the paper.","WTCOMTDM23.pdf","Norway, Secretariat"
"1699",1699,"49","49.     First, the availability of physical infrastructure should be enhanced for conducting e-commerce. The regulatory environment and the price of telecommunications services were import Widespread access to telecommunications was essential. In order to attain this objective, governments should focus on regulatory reforms and allow private competition in the telecommunications sector with the aim of reducing and keeping low the price of telecommunications. Governments should abstain from using the telecommunications as a major revenue earner for the government. Duty free or low duty access to computer equipment would also be important to ensure widespread access and use. Second, governments should invest in education, not just in higher education, but also in primary and secondary education. Widespread access to telecommunications could facilitate low-cost distance learning via the Internet. In this sense, access to education and access to telecommunications services interconnected. Third, developing countries or any other country, that wished to participate actively in e-commerce must ensure that domestic laws and regulations were conducive to the use of e-commerce for trade-related communications and delivery. According to the Secretariat's paper, developing countries have so far made few legislative reforms that would accommodate the requirements for e-commerce. Fourth, governments should avoid narrow sectoral approaches in choosing measures for building national capacity for e-commerce. Electronic commerce had the potential for system-wide and cross-sectoral benefits. Governments WT/COMTD/M/23 Page 12 should not attempt to pick ""winners"" (national champions), for instance, in trying to invest and develop particular sectors to facilitate e-commerce at the cost of others. An exception should be the educational sector where the return of earmarked investments in telecommunication access and computer equipment could be very high.","WTCOMTDM23.pdf","Secretariat"

This did not imply that the SCLDC had completed the WT/COMTD/M/23 Page 2 consideration of the two documents.

"1701",1701,"50","50.      His delegation concluded that to enhance the use of e-commerce, developing countries should focus on enhancing physical infrastructure;             proceed with regulatory      reform of the telecommunications sector; allow private competition in the telecommunications sector; develop supportive domestic legislation and regulations for the use of e-commerce; ensure low duty access for computer equipment; invest in education, including primary education. The private sector should be the driving force on how to utilise the potential presented by e-commerce.","WTCOMTDM23.pdf",""
"1702",1702,"51","51.     The representative of Egypt expressed appreciation to the Secretariat for the interesting paper. He drew attention to paragraph 2 of the Secretariat Note, which stated that it was a first step to address the issues in a preliminary manner. He raised a number of issues which he hoped that the Secretariat would address in future revisions or elaborations to the Note, which he hoped could be produced soon. He addressed a series of specific issues, as follows:         -       More attention needed to be accorded to the use of information technology to                 integrate developing countries in the multilateral trading system, contained in the                 third bullet point of the mandate from the General Council to the CTD. Not all trade                 problems of developing countries could be solved by e-commerce. However,                 attention should be given to how e-commerce in particular, and information                 technology in general, could be used to solve some of these problems, particularly at                 a time when the share of developing countries in global trade was declining.         -       Additional analysis was required from the Secretariat on investment requirements for                 e-commerce, and the costs faced by developing country firms in using e-commerce,                 as noted in paragraph 14 of the Note.         -       The relationship between rural and urban areas in developing countries and its effect                 on telecommunications density required further analysis.         -       Further work was required on the issue of revenue allocation and duties, which were                 briefly addressed in paragraphs 43 and 44. It would be desirable to determine how                 significant duties were in specific terms and in specific countries and to estimate how                 liberalization would affect revenues and their effects whether positive or otherwise.         -       Legal issues (paragraph 35) were also important and required further work,                 particularly questions relating to taxation in relation to e-commerce.         -       Issues regarding the substitution effect of e-commerce in trade of developing                 countries also required further study.         -       Further analysis should be made on the effects of e-commerce on inter-firm relations                 and how supply and demand would be affected on a disaggregated level. Related to                 this would be the possible effects of e-commerce on competition at the sectoral level.         -       The difficult issue of statistics should be incorporated into future discussions. It                 would be useful if an elaborated Secretariat Note would present how statistical issues                 are to be dealt with.                                                                        WT/COMTD/M/23                                                                               Page 13 -   The importance of human resource development had been highlighted by several     speakers. More detailed work was needed on the human resource needs of     developing countries in e-commerce. To this end, innovative solutions and success     stories should be emphasised. He called on the delegations of developed countries to     share their experiences in e-commerce with developing countries. Many of these     experiences could be shared because, for instance, small and medium size enterprises     in developing countries would have a lot in common with comparable enterprises in     developed countries. Another area where experiences could be shared because of the     cross-cutting character was in signatures where experience was illuminating and     innovative and could be shared with others. Yet another area was fraud on the     internet, and ancillary issues pertaining to jurisdictional questions. -   Further analysis was needed on the possibility of designing market solutions to policy     challenges, and the relationship between private sector development and     governmental regulation, particularly for development purposes. This was a     controversial area. His delegation should like to see these issues addressed. -   The Secretariat, in a future note might assist developing countries in weighing various     public policy options. Paragraph 29 of WT/COMTD/W/51 offered a good example     of the price of telecommunications. It indicated that developing countries should     strive to reduce the price of telecommunications, but to an extent might still provide     incentives to foreign investors to be attracted to these countries. A trade-off was,     therefore, apparent. The variables pertinent to such trade-offs required elaboration. -   The issue of intermediaries in e-commerce required further analysis in the light of     their potential effects on transactional costs. On this issue, various views existed.     Some have argued that these intermediaries may disappear, but that other forms of     intermediaries (cybermediaries) may appear. -   The degree of penetration of e-commerce in different sectors also required further     analysis. For example, it would be useful to know why some sectors, for example,     the services sector, had experienced deeper penetration by e-commerce than others.     The results of such analysis would have signficant policy implications for developing     countries. In the services sector, the effects of e-commerce on the movement of     natural persons would also require closer analysis. The larger issue would be to     understand how e-commerce would affect Members obligations and commitments in     the GATS. It was possible that commitments could be stretched because some of the     transactions undertaken by governments may not be detected even though the same     Members had undertaken specific commitments in this area. Concern had been     expressed as to the potential of e-commerce for undermining the protection that some     developing countries accord domestic producers in specific sectors. -   The issue of infrastructure: physical infrastructure, e-commerce infrastructure, and     the governance of the internet, was important and also required further analysis. -   E-commerce in the LDCs and in Africa required special attention. African     connectivity rates was one specific issue which could be further studied; for instance,     in 1995 only four African countries had full internet connectivity, while at present,     this had increased to about 47 countries. His delegation hoped that this progress     would continue, although telecommunications infrastructure in Africa was low and     weak. In recognition of the low levels of connectivity and low levels of     telecommunications infrastructure, the World Bank had recommended that Africa     should increase its connectivity levels from a rate of five lines per 1,000 to at least WT/COMTD/M/23 Page 14                 five lines per 100. This would require substantial investments by governments in                 developing countries before this recommended level can be achieved.","WTCOMTDM23.pdf","Egypt, Secretariat, Secretariat, Note, Secretariat, General, Council, CTD, Secretariat, Secretariat, Secretariat, Members, Members, Africa, Africa, World, Bank, Africa"

She highlighted several issues; a defining feature of e-commerce was access to networks to provide the band-width needed to advance e-commerce services. Access included providing for competition and regulation in network services, including the terms and conditions for interconnection and in favour of new entrants. Investment was initially important, particularly in technical and human resources. Investment in infrastructure could be encouraged through regimes that guarantee non-discriminatory treatment for companies.","WTCOMTDM23.pdf","United, States, Secretariat"
"1704",1704,"53","53.      She clarified that EDI was a closed system and was not the same as Internet-based information services. EDI was a proprietary information system developed exclusively for the use of select users. To the contrary, the Internet was an open system which could be used by services- providers around the globe to share information. Some developing countries appeared to have specified in law that the only system that could be used for customs purposes was the UNCTAD developed EDI system. The United States believed that it was unwise to stipulate the sole use of any particular technology. It was better to permit the use of the best technology as determined by the market-place. In paragraph 21, the Secretariat provided statistics which give a snapshot of the Internet today, which revealed the United States in an overwhelmingly dominant position. However, future data should show a declining trend of U.S. dominance of the Internet, and show increasing use in the developing world. The data provided by the representative of Egypt assisted in indicating the direction of use. In 1995, the number of users in Africa was small but in just a few years, the number had increased significantly. The U.S. was keen to see a steady increase in Internet use in Africa. It was also interesting to note that several developing countries were increasing Internet use.","WTCOMTDM23.pdf","UNCTAD, United, States, Secretariat, United, States, U.S., Egypt, Africa, U.S., Africa"

"1709",1709,"58","58.      The representative of Uganda welcomed the Secretariat paper. His delegation recognized that e-commerce was a phenomenon that had come to stay and was irreversible. However, the pace of evolution of e-commerce was considerable, and beyond the level of development and the capacity of many developing countries, in particular the least-developed countries. This situation made it imperative to address the needs faced by developing countries and to address those problems which hampered their ability to take advantage of e-commerce. The biggest problem regarding e-commerce which developing countries had to grapple with in the short and medium-term was the problem of weak and poor physical infrastructure, notably in the areas of energy and telecommunications. As contained in the Secretariat paper, the availability of good infrastructure was a prerequisite for benefitting from e-commerce. Good infrastructure was lacking in many developing countries especially the LDCs. He stated that in Uganda, power supply, telephones, fax and internet facilities were scarce, concentrated in urban areas, unreliable and expensive. Recently, the Ugandan government had liberalized the telecommunications sector and the results were encouraging. This problem of poor infrastructure in developing countries had to be addressed in order to level the playing field. He called on the international community to assist developing countries in this area. Similar assistance was also required in the development and improvement of human infrastructure requirements for e-commerce, technology transfer, etc.","WTCOMTDM23.pdf","Uganda, Secretariat, Secretariat, Uganda"

The representative of Uruguay welcomed the Secretariat paper and expressed appreciation to the delegations of the United States, Uganda, Norway and Egypt, for their valuable comments. Paragraphs 29, 30 and 32 on physical infrastructures contained concrete Secretariat suggestions to developing countries as to how to improve access to telecommunications, through reduction or elimination of tariffs for hardware or software, and improving developing country commitments under the GATS and the ITA (a plurilateral Agreement). However, there was no clear identification of the type of contributions, inputs or experiences that developed countries would give to developing countries in e-commerce. Paragraph 43 of the Secretariat Paper, relating to the revenue implications for developing countries from the use of e-commerce, referred to recent WTO Secretariat research on which it would be useful to have further information. Paragraph 44 noted that taxation of electronic transmissions is not impossible and that different methods of doing so were being studied by governments. He asked what was included under the concept of electronic transmissions. Referring to paragraph 48 on legal matters, he agreed that there must be a legal framework because the growth and development of e-commerce were intimately linked with the need to ensure legal security and privacy. In this regard, it would be useful to cooperate with international organizations in this area such as UNCITRAL, UNCTAD and others.","WTCOMTDM23.pdf","Uruguay, Secretariat, United, States, Uganda, Norway, Egypt, Secretariat, GATS, Secretariat, WTO, Secretariat, UNCITRAL, UNCTAD"

"1712",1712,"60","60.       The representative of Peru welcomed the Secretariat for the useful paper, which would ensure that the development dimension should be a positive contribution in the debate on e-commerce. The benefits obtained by developing countries from e-commerce would depend on how certain challenges are tackled, including access to computer infrastructure and training of human resources. Another important element was the development content, bearing in mind, cultural and linguistic diversity, referred to in paragraph 34 of the note. Efforts to face these challenges should be made by Governments which would also have to promote the active participation of the private sector. The note indicated how domestic policies could exert influence in creating an environment favourable to foreign investment, promoting private competition in domestic markets, and facilitating access to computer goods and services by means of tariff reductions. Domestic decisions which could result in specific commitments in the context of the GATS and the ITA could also facilitate this process. However, it could be questioned whether these efforts would be sufficient or whether they would need to be complemented by further efforts at the multilateral level. Having regard to the potential of e- commerce and its potential for the integration of the developing countries into the world economy, he felt that domestic policies should be integrated with international initiatives. If the WTO had a role to WT/COMTD/M/23 Page 16 play, then the document and the CTD debates could be a basis for considering the multilateral aspects of such efforts, including, inter alia, the identification of modalities for technical cooperation. Technical cooperation would be efficient in assisting developing countries to overcome access problems, problems with training, and initiating development content in e-commerce as well as financial resources that would be required for such efforts.","WTCOMTDM23.pdf","Peru, Secretariat, GATS, ITA, WTO"

His delegation agreed that the paper emphasised the right aspects and highlights the salient issues to be examined by the CTD, such as the positive educational benefits. In this regard, human resource development was crucial even for the European Communities. The representative of Egypt had raised a vast set of questions, several of which were directed at the developed countries, seeking to learn from their experiences. All these questions could not be answered. However, his delegation would think about several of the questions raised. The European Communities would endeavour to present its experiences, for instance, with small and medium sized enterprises.

It was felt that that several of the important issues raised in the course of the on-going debate could assist in structuring the debate at the Seminar in 1999. Furthermore, on-going parallel activities might be related and coordinated.

Although developing countries were forced to integrate into the multilateral trading system and had been ineluctably drawn into the globalization process, in electronic commerce these countries faced problems of infrastructure and other equipment problems. These problems were more acute in rural areas where the telecommunications network was not developed. The marginalization of developing countries could be further accentuated. Most of the developing countries did not have full control of the impact of electronic commerce. Regional and national seminars on the subject would be required. Considerable financial assistance would also be required.","WTCOMTDM23.pdf","Burundi, Secretariat, Egypt, Uganda"

In paragraph 51, the document highlighted the fact that computer software and services are now India's largest export earner. Against this background, India's interest in the subject of electronic commerce was evident. He associated his delegation with several points made by the representative of Egypt, and emphasised two points. First, India was interested in non-discriminatory access to and transfer of technology in this area. This objective was being separately pursued in discussions on electronic commerce in other fora. Second, in paragraph 39, the consequences for developments in this area in the field of movement of natural persons had been mentioned. He remarked that the problem of brain drain was not specific to the area of electronic commerce, but was a larger issue. Furthermore, the restrictions placed by some of the developed countries in the area of the movement of natural persons remained a strong barrier to international trade measures.","WTCOMTDM23.pdf","India, Secretariat, India, India, Egypt, India"

The representative of Mexico welcomed the Secretariat paper on the development implications of electronic commerce and noted that in electronic commerce, it was obvious that assisting developing countries was also to assist oneself. The question, however, was how to conduct this assistance. It could be said that half of the problems were for governments to resolve, and the other half rested on global interdependence. In this regard, the developed countries had a lot to offer in international organizations. Promoting development to ensure that developing countries benefit from new technologies in electronic commerce should be the objective. The challenge was to ensure that technical assistance and the development dimension should be focused on productivity and trade                                                                                      WT/COMTD/M/23                                                                                             Page 17 viability of a country to ensure a more balanced development. Needs and the problems should be clearly defined, the extent of resources should be ascertained, and viable projects with productive possibilities for an open economy should be developed.

"1718",1718,"66","66.      Several relevant issues could be identified in the Secretariat document, the representative of Mexico had identified several salient and relevant issues including: infrastructure for e-commerce. Modern telecommunications network and electricity distribution facilities were beneficial for developing countries and LDCs which lagged behind on such basic services. The problems in this area of services were technical and required more resources for their resolution. An important aspect of the resolution of the problem depended on government participation combined with technical assistance from and cooperation with the WTO and other international organizations such as the ITU, UNCTAD, etc. Technology was a key factor in the promotion of electronic commerce. It was not simply a question of acquiring business know-how and resources, but also knowing how to apply this knowledge in a technical manner. In this regard, cooperation with international organizations competent in the area of e-commerce was fundamental. Regional bodies were also conducting analysis on electronic commerce. Access was also an important issue with three main elements - access to infrastructure (fax, telephones, computers, modems, software, hardware, etc.); access to internet connections which offered broader access to information services and possibilities for trade; and access to databases for business creation. Cost was also an important aspect. Currently, two trends were visible. First, a negative upward trend in cost where the infrastructure depended on the telecommunications rates and other computer installations. In this connection, the basic equipment costs for computers and telephones remained very high in developing countries and LDCs.

Investment, education and training were also issues of cardinal importance.","WTCOMTDM23.pdf","Secretariat, Mexico, WTO, ITU, UNCTAD"
"1719",1719,"67","67.      The Secretariat document was a good basis for discussions in the CTD. The document should become the basis for further evolution and improvements in the CTD's deeper evaluation of the subject. It was possible that relevant recommendations could be drawn from the document. The index of document could be improved and re-ordered on a practical basis to achieve the goals of the CTD in the light of the forthcoming Seminar on Electronic Commerce and Development, 19 February 1999.     His delegation suggested the re-ordering of the Secretariat document as follows: (a) introduction - ""potential benefits""; (b) problems of infrastructure; (c) transparency; (d) transfer of technology; (e) effects of e-commerce on employment and movements of physical persons, effects of e-commerce on small- or medium-size businesses; (f) financial implications; (g) legal issues; (h) control of internet contents; (i) technical cooperation; and, (j) conclusions and recommendations.","WTCOMTDM23.pdf","Secretariat, CTD, CTD, CTD, Electronic, Commerce, and, Development, Secretariat"

She emphasised that the essential nature of e-commerce and cyberspace would put in question the issue of movement of natural persons. She also highlighted the point raised in paragraph 40 of the Secretariat document regarding the benefits that would accrue to developing countries by virtue of exploiting the advantages arising from and through e-commerce, particularly the advancement of skills in a country and overall income benefits.","WTCOMTDM23.pdf","United, States, Secretariat"

The representative of Australia underscored the importance, in future discussions, of focusing on the role of the liberalization of telecommunications under the GATS and the ITA could play in addressing the difficulties in infrastructure identified by developing countries. It would assist the CTD in its discussions to examine how liberalization under the GATS and other relevant agreements could contribute to building up the necessary infrastructure.

He also welcomed the Seminar to be organized by the United States private sector on 8 and 9 December 1998, which would be of tremendous assistance to developing country Members in their assessments of the potential benefits of e-commerce and information technology. He also agreed with the representative of the European Communities that many of the issues which had been raised in the course of the discussions under item on e-commerce in the CTD could be used in preparation for the Seminar in February 1999. It was also hoped that the concerns which had been raised should also be addressed in the course of the Seminar. There was an urgent need for more information on the issue of revenue loss. His delegation was not fearful of the overall benefits of e-commerce, but to the contrary was confident that the benefits of e-commerce would outweigh the losses. However, he simply desired a better understanding of the potential for and impact of possible revenue loss particularly in the light of the revenue situation of many developing countries. Finally, his delegation requested for informal consultations on the issues raised before the Seminar on Electronic Commerce and Development scheduled for February 1999.","WTCOMTDM23.pdf","Egypt, United, States, United, States, Members, CTD, Electronic, Commerce, and, Development"

The representative of the Secretariat stated that the Secretariat would take account of the issues raised in preparing for the Seminar on Electronic Commerce and Development, 19 February 1999. He reminded Members that the Secretariat outline for the Seminar had been earlier circulated informally. The outline had been focused on two themes namely on: (i) the business use of electronic commerce; and, (ii) the legal/regulatory issues at the level of government. He appealed to Members from developed and developing countries to forward to the Secretariat names of successful companies and of individuals or organizations in countries that could make useful contributions to the private sector and to the governmental legal and regulatory questions.","WTCOMTDM23.pdf","Secretariat, Secretariat, Electronic, Commerce, and, Development, Members, Secretariat, Members, Secretariat"
"1725",1725,"72","72.      The representative of Canada was confident that the Seminar on Electronic Commerce and Development, scheduled for February 1999, would assist in achieving the objectives of the CTD Work Programme on Electronic Commerce. Her delegation underscored the importance of clear objectives for the February 1999 Seminar. This objective had to be linked to the overall objectives of the WTO Work Programme. She agreed with the proposal by the Secretariat to structure the Seminar on two themes, and also to include private sector participation. However, the first theme: the business use of electronic commerce, might be re-phrased to encompass private/public partnerships. In the case of the second theme: legal and regulatory issues at the governmental level, the focus could be on trade-related issues within the purview of the WTO Work Programme. Regarding substantive discussions at the February 1999 Seminar, her delegation hoped that discussions at other fora, such as at the UNCTAD ""Partners for Development"" Meeting at Lyon, France, 9-12 November 1998, although very useful, would not be duplicated. The CTD Seminar should focus on the development aspects of electronic commerce related to the WTO Work Programme. The CTD document provided a good starting-point for discussions on the development implications of e-commerce. Her delegation would comment more fully on the Secretariat document at a later stage.","WTCOMTDM23.pdf","Canada, Electronic, Commerce, and, Development, CTD, Work, Programme, Electronic, Commerce, WTO, Work, Programme, Secretariat, WTO, Work, Programme, UNCTAD, Lyon, France, WTO, Work, Programme, CTD, Secretariat"

"1727",1727,"74","74.     Mr. Gurunlian recalled that the Lyon Meeting was the outcome of the mandate given to the Secretary General to organise a single meeting to serve as an example of what UNCTAD might achieve in conjunction with civil society. The meeting could not be financed out of the regular                                                                                    WT/COMTD/M/23                                                                                           Page 19 budget, and the support of sponsors, and particularly the City of Lyon, was critical. The representatives of civil society attending the Meeting were invited on the basis of their capacity to participate in partnerships for development. There were 5000 participants at the summit and half were from the private sector. Fifty Ministers and six heads of states attended, as did numerous NGOs. Mr. Gurunlian stated that the organisers of the meeting had the courage to address a number of sensitive procedural issues. For instance, no speeches were given and there was no negotiated text to adopt which allowed participants to focus on discussing the main issues covered by the summit. Ministers and representatives of NGOs were placed on equal footing.","WTCOMTDM23.pdf","Gurunlian, UNCTAD, Lyon, Gurunlian"
"1728",1728,"75","75.      Mr. Gurunlian informed the meeting that two groups of subjects were discussed at the meeting. The subjects discussed in the first group were electronic commerce and transport, in view of the fact that e-commerce presented significant opportunities for developing countries, while high transport costs posed a significant problem for developing countries. Agreed partnerships included the provision of free services by four of the five major Information Technology consultancy firms to developing countries wishing to undertake a study of their legal framework for E-Commerce, and an arrangement between IRU and 80 countries to better manage transit traffic. The second group was given the title of ""Profits and Development"", reflecting the fact that there can be a convergence between the profit motive of private enterprise and development objectives. Areas covered included the following: (i) commodities, particularly the minimisation of risks resulting from price fluctuations, and the use of modern financial instruments to reduce transaction costs; (ii) micro- finance, were a notable achievement in convincing several large financial institutions to raise funds from international markets in order that these be lent by micro-finance institutions; (iii) investment, through the participation of the Association for the Promotion of Investment; and, (iv) the Bio-trade programme, based on the Convention on Bio-trade which seeks to strengthen the negotiating position of indigenous peoples, in order to allow them to benefit from the marketing gains on products based on indigenous resources.","WTCOMTDM23.pdf","Gurunlian, Information, Technology, IRU, Association, for, the, Promotion, of, Investment"

The representative of Egypt thanked Mr. Gurunlian for his presentation, and expressed the appreciation of his government to the government of France, the City of Lyon and its Mayor Raymond Barre. He noted that the Egyptian delegation to the Lyon Meeting consisted of 18 people, 14 of whom were from Cairo, and who were active in a number of fields, such as agriculture, micro-finance and the private sector. He expressed the view that, for the first time, real partnerships had been made, and that the choice of subjects covered in the summit was excellent. He noted that while some of the issues discussed were new, and others longstanding, they were all approached from a new perspective, and all required the arrangement of public - private partnerships. He hoped that similarly innovative events could be repeated in the future, and stated that his delegation would follow the matter up with UNCTAD. He proposed that the meeting be held every four years as a regular feature of UNCTAD's activities, adding that he hoped that others would support such a trend.","WTCOMTDM23.pdf","Egypt, Gurunlian, France, Lyon, Raymond, Barre, Cairo, UNCTAD, UNCTAD"

Those comments had been exhaustive and the Secretariat had taken note of the comments made. The Chairman informed the WT/COMTD/M/23 Page 20 meeting that he understood from the Secretariat that the paper requested by the delegation of Egypt on the use of information technology in the delivery of technical assistance was still in preparation and would be ready in good time for the next meeting.

He recalled that it was agreed that the Secretariat would consult with delegations that had raised the various points. He understood that a date acceptable to all delegation for holding such consultations was still being sought.","WTCOMTDM23.pdf","Chairman, CTD, Secretariat, Secretariat"
"1735",1735,"81","81.      The representative of Morocco reiterated the importance attached by his delegation to the concept of external evaluation. He stated that external evaluation should be a systematic complement to internal evaluation, and that the guidelines and modalities for implementation adopted by the Committee left the window open for external evaluation. The Secretariat Note (Job No. 4299) of 26 August 1998 mentioned this possibility and explained certain important aspects of external evaluation. He added that his delegation had on several occasions underlined the positive impact of external evaluation on technical assistance. The recourse to external evaluation ensured objectivity in addressing the concerns of all involved and in the measurement of the impact of technical assistance in enhancing capacity. External evaluation facilitated the implementation of technical cooperation programmes, ensured linkages between activities, allowed for increased transparency and quality control, and could facilitate the streamlining of the use of human resources in the WTO.","WTCOMTDM23.pdf","Morocco, Committee, Secretariat, WTO"
"1736",1736,"82","82.     The representative for Morocco further noted that several delegations were in favour of external evaluation. His delegation understood concerns expressed about involving the WTO in a costly evaluation exercise, and stressed that any such exercise should be realistic and cost-effective. His delegation was prepared to examine alternatives that would reflect the concerns of both those in support of and those who expressed reservations about external evaluation.","WTCOMTDM23.pdf","Morocco, WTO"
"1737",1737,"83","83.      The representative of Switzerland said that his delegation wished to see progress on this issue. He noted that discussions had continued over the course of a year, and that there was consensus that the evaluation of technical assistance should take place. Current discussions centred around issues such as whether evaluation should be internal or external, determination of criteria and methodology, etc. These discussions risked indefinite continuation. Noting that no date had been set for informal consultations, the representative of Switzerland expressed dissatisfaction with the present state of affairs. His delegation was not opposed to external evaluation, adding that there was no contradiction between external evaluation and the internal evaluation which had already started. He added that external evaluation should not interfere with the procedures already set up by the Secretariat, and suggested that an expert from the International Trade Centre (ITC) could be invited to attend the consultations, to provide expertise and advice in devising criteria and methodology for the evaluation of WTO technical assistance.","WTCOMTDM23.pdf","Switzerland, Switzerland, Secretariat, International, Trade, Centre, ITC, WTO"
"1738",1738,"84","84.      The representative of Egypt supported the idea of inviting an expert from the ITC, and added that the invitation could be extended to an expert from the UNCTAD. He then recalled the concern, expressed at the time of writing of the Secretariat Note, regarding the availability of funds for technical assistance, and asked whether any developments in this respect had taken place since the distribution of the Note. He further recalled that his delegation had requested the preparation of a factual paper by the Secretariat, for the purpose of transparency, regarding conditions associated with the funds that had been provided to the WTO for technical assistance.

"1739",1739,"85","85.     The representative of the Secretariat (Mr. J-M. Léger) said that his office had tried to schedule informal consultations with several delegations that had expressed interest in the evaluation of technical assistance. The date of 10 December 1998 had been proposed, but the dates had been unsuitable for two delegations. Since 14 December 1998 clashed with the meeting of the General Council, he suggested the date of 17 December. He informed the meeting that his office would contact the delegations concerned as to the suitability of this date at the next informal meeting. The purpose of this meeting would be to conduct a ""brainstorming"" exercise regarding the method of evaluation.","WTCOMTDM23.pdf","Secretariat, J-M, Léger, General, Council"
"1740",1740,"86","86.      The Secretariat representative said that the average size of a WTO technical assistance mission or workshop was 2.3 days, at an average cost of 10,000 Swiss Francs. He pointed out that the cost of any technical assistance provided by the ICC needed to exceed a lower limit of 300,000 to 400,000 Swiss Francs before any evaluation took place. Therefore, the WTO should not be compared to the ITC or the UNCTAD, with respect to technical assistance activities. Mr. Léger agreed with all delegations that an evaluation was necessary, and said that such an exercise should be in line with the technical mission undertaken.","WTCOMTDM23.pdf","Secretariat, WTO, ICC, WTO, ITC, UNCTAD, Léger"
"1741",1741,"87","87.     He recalled that at the last formal meeting a shortfall of 3 million Swiss Francs had been projected for 1999. Since the last meeting, several delegations had informally indicated possibilities of funding for the 1999 programme, to an extent that would reduce the projected shortfall to 1 million Swiss Francs. Furthermore, he informed the meeting that his office would take the necessary steps to prepare the paper on conditions attached to funds provided for technical assistance. He added that it was necessary to consult with donors to examine whether the disclosure of such information to representatives at this meeting would present any difficulties.","WTCOMTDM23.pdf",""

"1743",1743,"89","89.     The representative of the European Communities supported the statement made by the Secretariat regarding the scope and intensity of technical assistance provided by the WTO compared with other organisations. His delegation did not wish to see an excessively bureaucratic mechanism, which was one reason why it had been reticent about external evaluation at a time when internal evaluation had not been properly established.","WTCOMTDM23.pdf","Secretariat, WTO"

He informed the CTD that, following an invitation from the World Bank, the WTO Secretariat was now part of an Advisory Board of the Task Force on Small States established by the World Bank and the Commonwealth, and was participating at a meeting of the Board at that time. He also informed Members that Fiji, Guatemala and Mauritius had circulated new documents on the item.","WTCOMTDM23.pdf","CTD, World, Bank, WTO, Secretariat, Advisory, Board, of, the, Task, Force, World, Bank, Commonwealth, Members, Fiji, Guatemala, Mauritius"

The paper was still unclear as to the feedback mechanism between evaluation and future projects. Noting that the secretariat had presented six proposals on parameters at the last meeting of the Sub-Committee on Least-Developed Countries, the representative of the European Communities said that his delegation would be willing to pursue this technical discussion in an informal way.","WTCOMTDM23.pdf","European, Communities"
"1746",1746,"91","91.     The representative of Switzerland thanked Mr. Léger for the information provided to the meeting, and enquired as to whether an ITC expert had been invited to the informal meeting proposed for 17 December 1998, and whether there was opposition to the presence of such an expert.","WTCOMTDM23.pdf","Switzerland, Léger, ITC"
"1747",1747,"92","92.     Mr. Léger said there was no objection to the presence of an ITC expert.

"1748",1748,"93","93.     The representative of the United States stated that his delegation supported the concept of introducing procedures to allow a better internal evaluation by the Secretariat of its technical assistance activities. Technical assistance was a partnership between the secretariat and the recipient, with an important role played by members. He said the delivery of technical assistance was one WT/COMTD/M/23 Page 22 component of a process that began with the identification of needs, continued with the development and delivery of the programme by the Secretariat, in combination with appropriate officials from the recipient country, and was supported by follow up. The identification of needs was one of the most important parts of the process, and was required for the effective evaluation of technical assistance. The beneficiary country had the main responsibility to ensure that requests for technical assistance were well focussed. While it is incumbent on the Secretariat to ensure follow up to their programmes, it was equally important for beneficiaries to provide on-going structures for those attending training and to ensure that information was used to achieve the goals of the training activity.

"1753",1753,"98","98.     The representative of Switzerland thanked the Secretariat for the Informal Note. He said that there was some discrepancy between the information required of applicant bodies, as detailed in the Note, and the actual letters of application that had been forwarded to the delegations. While his delegation did not have any substantive objection to any of the Members, it did consider that procedural and systemic issues were involved. It was difficult to formulate a judgement regarding the applications against the criteria set out in the Note, on the basis of the short letters sent. Consequently, the representative of Switzerland suggested that if other Members shared this view that the                                                                                    WT/COMTD/M/23                                                                                           Page 23 organisations should be invited to submit applications with fuller information as a           matter of transparency and procedure.","WTCOMTDM23.pdf","Switzerland, Secretariat, Members, Switzerland, Members"

Beginning with the question as to how the Secretariat would proceed, he indicated that the first step consisted in discussing the forms in detail with Divisions which participated in technical assistance, and making sure the forms were used in future technical assistance activities. Second, he indicated that feedback referred to the topics covered, and whether these had met the objectives of the event; the handling of logistics; the suitability and timely distribution of documentation; and the sequencing of the presentation.

The Chairman said that in a letter addressed to him, dated 1 September 1998, Ambassador Saborío, Chairman of the Council for Trade in Goods, requested the Committee on Trade and Development to contribute to the Work Programme on Trade Facilitation of the Council for Trade in Goods. The CTD had since discussed trade facilitation at two of its meetings. However, very few concrete issues relating to development aspects of trade facilitation were identified by delegations. At its meeting of 7 December 1998, the Committee on Trade and Development asked the Secretariat to produce a draft document for its contribution. Secretariat note WT/COMTD/LDC/W/15 aimed at meeting that request. He added that the European Communities had recently submitted a paper on trade facilitation and development. The document would soon be circulated as a multi-symbol document.

It was foreseen that contributions by other WTO bodies, including the CTD, would be considered at that meeting. The Chairman said the CTD should use the current meeting to decide upon its contribution, and invited suggestions from delegations for a CTD contribution to the Work Programme of the Council for Trade in Goods. He suggested that the contribution take the form of a letter to the Chairman of the Committee on Trade in Goods in which the Chairman of the CTD would explain, on his own responsibility, the discussions held in the Committee on Trade and development.","WTCOMTDM24.pdf","Chairman, Council, for, Trade, in, Goods, WTO, WTO, CTD, Chairman, CTD, CTD, Council, for, Trade, in, Goods, Chairman, Committee, on, Trade, in, Goods, Chairman, CTD, Committee, on, Trade"

The representative of the European Communities drew the attention of Members to the two documents it had circulated, and to the fact that the document was circulated by the European Communities and not the European Commission alone. The document entitled Trade Facilitation and Development aimed to show that the benefits of trade facilitation accrued to all Members and in particular developing countries. The second document entitled Trade Facilitation in Relation to Existing WTO Agreements highlighted the leading role of the WTO in furthering the objectives of trade facilitation, and identified the different ""hooks"" in existing WTO agreements which can be used to achieve the simplification of trade procedures.","WTCOMTDM24.pdf","European, Communities, Members, European, Commission, Trade, Facilitation, and, Development, Members, WTO, WTO, WTO"

He proposed that a representative of the ACP be invited to the informal meeting in view of the suggestions made by the ACP at a previous meeting. He asked whether a letter from the CTD to the Council on Trade in Goods was the most efficient means by which the CTD could contribute to the discussion on trade facilitation, given that the issue was of major interest especially as technical cooperation and education were concerned.","WTCOMTDM24.pdf","Mexico, CTD, ACP, ACP, CTD, CTD"

The main focus of the conference had been the vulnerability of small island economies, resulting in part from external catastrophes and also from external shocks to income and exports. At the meeting, the World Bank and the Commonwealth Secretariat provided a revised draft of their Vulnerability Index. In relation to the trade aspect, the meeting focussed on the ways and means of strengthening the participation of small states in the WTO system. Emphasis was also placed on finding ways by which small states could cooperate with others on issues of concern, such as the building of technical capacity, or participation in WTO meetings in Geneva. Mr. Tulloch confirmed that the trade issue was being covered in a paper under preparation jointly by the World Bank and the Commonwealth Secretariat, and that this paper would be presented first to the IMF and World Bank Development Committee and that the authors of the paper would be willing and able to present the paper to the Committee on Trade and Development at it's next meeting.","WTCOMTDM24.pdf","Tulloch, Members, CTD, Small, Island, Economies, World, Bank, Commonwealth, Secretariat, St., Lucia, World, Bank, Commonwealth, Secretariat, WTO, WTO, Geneva, Tulloch, World, Bank, Commonwealth, Secretariat, IMF, World, Bank, Development, Committee, Committee, on, Trade, and, Development"
"1788",1788,"124","124.     The representative of Mauritius thanked Mr. Tulloch for the information provided regarding the meeting in St. Lucia. He said the aim of the meeting was to hold the widest possible consultations regarding the issue of vulnerability and appropriate policy responses. Taking its cue from Mr. J. Burki (Vice-President for Latin America and the Caribbean Region, the World Bank), the conference considered the following issues: the implications of high volatility in GDP; problems of economies of scale; advantages arising from trade openness; the role of trade preferences in growth; opportunities created by globalisation, and transitional cost of integrating small economies into the global economy; development of vulnerability index with widest acceptability; use of financial instruments in mitigating the adverse effects of disasters; the pursuit of sound domestic economic policies that encourage domestic savings to finance development; and support from donors to resolve transitional problems of ""graduation"". The representative of Mauritius pointed to the conclusions reached by the conference: there was consensus that the lending policies of multilateral agencies needed to be adjusted to meet the special needs of small states, including Bank willingness to structure it's policies of lending and assistance to small states; the inadequacy of the per capita income criterion in determining the eligibility of small states for [multilateral lending]; small states should take advantage of globalisation, and that substantial flows of external resources would be required to meet costs of transition. Following the conclusion of the meeting, the Advisory Board and the task force met, and it was agreed that the results of the conference and the report would be submitted to the Development Committee of the World Bank and the IMF. The representative of Mauritius said that it was his perception, on the basis of discussion which took place, that the joint members representatives would address the CTD at its meeting on 2 June. He added that the work of the WTO would be enriched by contributions and work undertaken by some of the other organisations which had attended the meeting, such as the Organisation of American States.","WTCOMTDM24.pdf","Mauritius, Tulloch, St., Lucia, J., Burki, Latin, America, Caribbean, Region, World, Bank, Mauritius, Bank, Advisory, Board, Development, Committee, of, the, World, Bank, IMF, Mauritius, CTD, WTO, Organisation, of, American, States"

The representative of Cuba said her delegation supported statements made by Guatemala, Fiji and Mauritius with respect to the following: the need to set up favourable and predictable conditions of market access for small states; the need for adjustments by the international community regarding rules of origin that discriminate against small countries; and, the need to include flexible provisions for products emanating from such countries. It was necessary to correct the lack of progress on rules of origin, in view of the fact that not all countries have equal privileges and rights in the determination of such rules, which was controlled by developed countries through a number of international institutions including international financial agencies. Furthermore, small states had been compelled to accept long term benefits of adjustments without measurement of the impact on social and WT/COMTD/M/24 Page 20 economic conditions. Her delegation supported the establishment of programmes of assistance in favour of small states and LDCs to support the cost of adjustment. The erosion of trade preferences through regional trade agreements had a particular impact on small countries, given their vulnerability and the fact that they could only function in the world market efficiently through the provision of preferences. The CTD should contribute to the understanding that the implementation of liberalisation policies in small states should respect the different levels of development prevailing in these countries and their susceptibility to natural disasters.","WTCOMTDM24.pdf","Cuba, Guatemala, Fiji, Mauritius, LDCs, CTD"

Participants included representatives of Caribbean countries, New Zealand, the European Commission, the Commonwealth Secretariat, and a number of universities. She said the frequency of meeting on Small States was an indicator of the importance of this issue. There had been wide discussion at the Wilton Conference on various issues pertaining to small states, including issues discussed by the joint Commonwealth/World Bank task force, and the participation of small states in the international rules based system, and the extent to which the system had responded fairly and sensitively to the interests of small states.","WTCOMTDM24.pdf","Barbados, Members, Wilton, House, Sussex, Caribbean, New, Zealand, European, Commission, Commonwealth, Secretariat, Wilton, Conference, Commonwealth/World, Bank"

The compilation was to be based on information available in the Secretariat and replies to a questionnaire which Members would complete and identify their difficulties, if any. The Chairman then called on the Director of the Development Division, Mr. Tulloch, to give Members a status report on the preparation of the requested document.

It was emphasised that without replies from a representative group of Members, work carried out on implementation would be incomplete, and appealed to members to submit responses.

The representative of Brazil said Brazil attached special importance to the Special and Differential provisions of the WTO agreements, and that his delegation would be shortly submitting responses to the Secretariat questionnaire. He said that because the work of the Secretariat was limited to a mere objective compilation of Special and Differential provisions, it could imply that these provisions responded adequately to the needs of better integrating developing countries into the multilateral trading system. Such a perception did not enjoy consensus in this CTD, and Brazil believed that some of these provisions needed to be revisited if a reasonable balance of rights and obligations was to be achieved in the multilateral trading system. The representative of Brazil said that, in the light of these remarks and the possible launching of a new round of multilateral trade negotiations, his delegation proposed that the Secretariat undertake, on the basis of the questionnaire, analytical work on the participation of developing countries in the multilateral system.","WTCOMTDM24.pdf","Brazil, Brazil, WTO, Secretariat, Secretariat, Brazil, Brazil, Secretariat"

He said his delegation, along with others, had made a number of submissions to intersessional meetings highlighting specific provisions for Special and Differential treatment which had proved to have been inadequate, or whose operation had been inadequate, and which had been detrimental to trade from developing countries. He requested that the Secretariat take into account the various submissions made. He recognised that undertaking analytical work on the impact of S & D provisions, as proposed by Brazil, would add substantially to the work of the Secretariat and that his delegation would be satisfied, as an intermediate stage, with a simple compilation of responses to questionnaires.

Checklists had been prepared on the basis of submissions made to other bodies of the WTO, but more comprehensive information was required to examine the information difficulties on each and every provision for Special and Differential treatment provisions. The Secretariat intended to circulate the paper well before the next meeting. XI.

Prior to her appointment as Permanent Representative of Senegal to the United Nations in Geneva, since May 1996, she was Permanent Representative of her country to the United Nations in New York from 1988 to 1991. In New York, she represented Senegal at the Security Council from 1988 to 1989 and was President of the Security Council in March 1989. She also held the position of President of the Committee for the Exercise of the Rights of the Palestinian People from 1988 to 1991, as well as the Presidency of the Ad Hoc Committee for Kampuchea from August to December 1990. Madame Diallo also served as Ambassador to Sweden (1992-1993); Ambassador to Norway (February to October 1993) with concurrent accreditation to Finland and Denmark; and Ambassador to Russia from November 1993 to December 1995.

She thanked the Chairman for his efforts throughout his tenure, and congratulated him for the results he had achieved. She stated that 1999 would be a year of many challenges. The High Level Symposium on Trade and Development was due to be held in Mid March. The Third Ministerial Conference could be the occasion to initiate a likely new round of multilateral trade negotiations on multilateral trade. The importance of the development dimension remained, for CTD members, the link between these different meetings. The most significant part of the CTD's mandate lay in it's role as central point for the review and coordination of the development work carried out by the WTO. She shared the point of view of developing countries who had emphasised that the development dimension should feature in the work of the Organisation, and said that this view was also shared by members of the CTD. She said trade liberalisation was good for all countries, and the goal of liberalisation should be the welfare of the population of Member countries. For this reason, she would devote all her energy in the pursuit of the objectives of the WTO and the fulfilment of the mandate of the CTD.","WTCOMTDM24.pdf","Ambassador, Diallo, chairman, CTD, Africa, Chairman, CTD, WTO, Organisation, CTD, Member, WTO, CTD"

Ambassador Diallo invited the CTD to reflect and initiate progress on the different items under its consideration, notably the following: an exchange of views on the elements of the development dimension; the integration of developing countries in the trading system in terms of market access, and in terms of the formulation and application of trade policy in the WTO; improvements in the quality and delivery of technical assistance geared to the needs identified by developing countries themselves; an analysis of difficulties in the application of provisions for special and differential treatment; and the contribution of the committee to the next Ministerial Conference. She proposed that this last issue be an agenda item at the June meeting of the CTD, adding that it would be the occasion to reflect on the next ministerial in an extensive, focussed and coherent way. She said that the list of issues she enumerated was not exhaustive, but exploratory and indicative of what the CTD could decide to cover.

He reiterated India's commitment to LDCs, including the granting of market access measures through the GSTP and regional trade arrangements such as SAFTA, which India had expressed at the High Level Meeting on Integrated Initiatives for Least Developed Countries' Trade Development. He said that Paragraph 2(c) of the Enabling Clause provided for preferential tariff and non tariff treatment to be extended by WTO Members to LDCs, and that Uruguay's proposal for the inclusion of a disclaimer in the body of the draft Decision suggested that the Enabling Clause was juridically sufficient for developing countries to grant preferential treatment to LDCs. His delegation was therefore not convinced of the utility of the draft Decision, feeling it would undermine the Enabling Clause, and wanted to know what juridical additionality was sought through the waiver, over and above the provisions of the Enabling Clause.","WTCOMTDM24.pdf","India, Director-General, India, India, SAFTA, India, Integrated, Initiatives, for, Least, Developed, Countries, ', Trade, Development, WTO, Members, Uruguay"

First, the European Communities had circulated a proposal for the WTO Law Advisory Centre, which would be discussed in the General Council. The proposal was connected to development. The proposal sought to strengthen the ability of the Secretariat in providing developing country members with trade specific support and assistance on request, and thus strengthen their ability to make better use of the Dispute Settlement Mechanism.

He thanked the European Communities for their initiatives concerning assistance to developing countries in the use of the Dispute Settlement Mechanism, and the acceleration of accessions to the WTO.

The representative of Brazil said his delegation would not stand in the way of a consensus in favour of the derestriction of the documents requested by the European Communities. He recalled that his delegation had expressed reserves about paragraph 16 of WT/COMTD/LDC/W/11/Rev1 regarding developed and developing country tariffs on products from LDCs. Comparisons between developed and developing country tariffs on LDC exports should not be restricted to an arithmetic exercise but should consider the social and economic reasons that explain why developing countries may impose higher tariffs than developed countries on products emanating from LDCs.","WTCOMTDM24.pdf","Brazil, European, Communities"

He reiterated that the comment made by the Secretariat that four emerging Latin American economies, including Mexico, had reinforced antidumping and safeguard mechanisms to counter the effects of currency depreciations following the Asian crisis, was not objective. There was no link between exchange rate depreciations and exports by LDCs into Latin America, and Mexico had not imposed antidumping or safeguard measures on any LDC exports. Consequently, the footnote to paragraph 46(c) should be deleted in order to render the document objective, and the delegation of Mexico would remain opposed to derestriction until such action was taken.","WTCOMTDM24.pdf","Mexico, Secretariat, Mexico, LDCs, Latin, America, Mexico, Mexico"

His delegation agreed with the draft Decision as proposed and hoped that in due course a number of preferential schemes could be established.

The representative of Brazil said his delegation supported the draft Decision on the understanding that developing countries needed specific mechanisms to mitigate their structural vulnerabilities in order make their participation in the multilateral trading system viable and less disadvantageous. His delegation viewed with some scepticism the possibility that the waiver might result in a significant increase in exports by LDCs to emerging markets. Discussions in the Sub- Committee on Least Developed Countries suggested that supply side constraints were possibly more important than market access barrier; goods produced by LDCs often competed with products from developing countries, and it was necessary to take into account the financial crises experienced by many emerging markets. He said that the implementation of differential access measures by developed counties had been insufficient to enhance the integration of the LDCs into the global market. His delegation understood that the waiver did not alter the primary responsibility of developed countries, foreseen in the single undertaking of the Uruguay Round, in applying the provisions of special and differential treatment, and that it did not alter the basic balance of rights and obligations.","WTCOMTDM24.pdf","Brazil, Sub, -, Committee, on, Least, Developed, Countries, LDCs, LDCs, Uruguay, Round"

Therefore, the waiver was intended to cover the concerns of all Members.

He recalled that paragraphs 2(c) and 2(d) of the Enabling Clause together constituted the legal basis for the provision of unilateral preferential treatment regarding products of interest to LDCs. Paragraph 2(c) provided for developing countries to enter into global or regional trade arrangements to give preferences to each other on a mutual and reciprocal basis. Paragraph 2(d) provided for the special treatment of Least Developed Countries in the context of any general or specific measure in favour of developing countries. Thus, if a developing country wished to provide special treatment to LDCs in the context of the GSTP or regional arrangements, it could do so on the basis of the Enabling Clause, and this was reflected in paragraph 6 of the draft Decision. The additionality provided for by the waiver, covered the extension of preferential treatment by developing countries to LDCs outside any existing global arrangement and outside any regional arrangement. Mr. Hoda said that the waiver represented a juridical action since it added to the provisions of the Enabling Clause.","WTCOMTDM24.pdf","Director-General, Hoda, India, Hoda"

This would correct what he considered to be a typographical error, since it had been previously agreed that all UN designated LDCs, and not just WTO Members, were entitled to benefit from preferential treatment that would be granted under the waiver.","WTCOMTDM24.pdf","Republic, of, Korea, Members, Member, UN, WTO, Members"

"1868",1868,"5","5.      The Chairman recalled that applications by nine Intergovernmental Organizations for Observer Status in the CTD were still outstanding. At the Chairman's request, Mr. Hoda, Deputy Director-General, conducted Informal Consultations on 25 January 1999 on several matters before the CTD including on these nine outstanding requests for Observer Status. To assist Members, the Secretariat had produced an informal chart showing the type of work undertaken by these organizations; the WTO Members present in these organizations; non-Members present; any previous formal association with the GATT/WTO; and reciprocity with the WTO. This chart was available in the room where the Committee was meeting. The chairman added that an Informal Note on WTO rules regarding Observer Status for international Intergovernmental Organizations in the WTO had been previously circulated on 27 November 1998.","WTCOMTDM24.pdf","Chairman, Intergovernmental, Organizations, for, Observer, Status, CTD, Chairman, Hoda, Director-General, CTD, Members, Secretariat, WTO, Members, GATT/WTO, WTO, Committee, chairman, WTO, Observer, Status, for, international, Intergovernmental, Organizations, WTO"

He recalled that the deadline for WTO bodies to provide information to the General Council was 30 July 1999 and that the CTD therefore only had two meetings, including the present meeting, left at which it could decide on its final contribution. He proposed that the contribution could take the form of a letter from the Chair of the CTD, to the Chair of the General Council explaining, on the responsibility of the Chair of the CTD, the discussions held by the CTD.        1          WT/COMTD/W/38 of 3 March 1998.        2          WT/COMTD/W/51 of 23 November 1998.        3          WT/COMTD/17 of 12 February 1999.

The representative of the United States commended the Secretariat for the organisation of the seminar, adding that the comments made by participants were excellent and that her delegation looked forward to the Secretariat report so that these comments would be documented. She also noted the comments from some of the Members which targeted issues raised since the launching of the programme. She pointed out that the paper circulated by her delegation contained a section on development which indicated current developments concerning the United States's new development assistance project. This project was conducted separately from the WTO through the United States' aid agencies.

"1875",1875,"56","56.      The representative of Egypt said that his delegation supported the communication to the General Council proposed by the Chairman. However, more work was still required, and more reflection was needed between the present and the next CTD meeting to determine what additional contribution could be made to the General Council, in light of the discussions that had occurred in the Seminar on Electronic Commerce, and the contributions by the United States and others. Further informal consultations could be required to determine the most appropriate input of the CTD to the General Council in relation to the work programme.","WTCOMTDM24.pdf","Egypt, General, Council, Chairman, CTD, General, Council, Electronic, Commerce, United, States, CTD, General, Council"

"1879",1879,"6","6.       The Chairman said that Mr. Hoda's consultations on 25 January suggested that most Members agreed that this item had been with the CTD for far too long. It was also understood that the CTD should adhere to the guidelines for Observer Status for IGOs in the WTO (document WT/L/161) emphasising in particular that requests for Observer Status shall be considered on a case-by-case basis, and that this could be done on an ad hoc basis with observers invited meeting by meeting. Several Members also felt that because the CTD covered a wide area of trade-related economic interests, it should not be too rigid in according Observer Status to applicant organizations.","WTCOMTDM24.pdf","Chairman, Hoda, Members, CTD, CTD, WTO, Members, CTD"
"1880",1880,"60","60.     The representative of the European Communities thanked the Secretariat for the organisation of the seminar.

Even though some questions remained unanswered, and some answers were not of any help, the seminar did leave his delegation better informed about the subject of electronic commerce. He thanked those, notably the delegation of Canada, the Secretariat and the different participants, who made the seminar possible. His delegation awaited the swift preparation and circulation of the Secretariat report. He concluded by asking if a letter by the chairman of the CTD to the chairman of the General Council was the only means by which the CTD could address the General Council on the subject of electronic commerce and whether alternative means were available.","WTCOMTDM24.pdf","Senegal, Canada, Secretariat, Secretariat, chairman, CTD, chairman, General, Council, CTD, General, Council"

The representative of Mexico said that his delegation supported the proposal made by Egypt for the holding of further consultations, saying that much remained to be done in regard to this subject. His delegation was particularly interested in work undertaken in the other subsidiary bodies and what consideration had been given to the definition of electronic commerce. For instance Council on Trade in Services provided a definition of electronic commerce which covered the delivery of goods, such as hardware, by non electronic means. He wished to know whether electronic commerce referred to transactions that would solely be dealt with by means of the internet. He said that recently undertaken research that concluded that duty free cyberspace transactions will not have serious fiscal WT/COMTD/M/24 Page 10 consequences should be considered jointly with research currently being conducted by UNCTAD and the OECD.","WTCOMTDM24.pdf","Mexico, Egypt, Council, on, Trade, in, Services, UNCTAD, OECD"

At that meeting, Members recognized the significant benefits that could accrue and the potentially vast improvements in access to beneficiaries that could be made through the use of Information Technology in the delivery of technical assistance. The Secretariat's background note has now been circulated in document WT/COMTD/W/59. The Chairman called on the Director of the Technical Cooperation Division to introduce the note.","WTCOMTDM24.pdf","Chairman, CTD, Secretariat, Members, Information, Technology, Secretariat, Chairman, Director, Technical, Cooperation, Division"
"1894",1894,"73","73.      The Director of the Technical Cooperation Division, Mr. Léger, informed the meeting that the document provided background information in the use of information technology in the delivery of technical assistance, and covered information dissemination, improving communications, information technology based delivery of technical assistance, and options for the future. Under the heading information dissemination, it was indicated that in order to maximise the usefulness of information made available by the WTO, potential recipients of information needed to have appropriate infrastructure and training for efficient retrieval of information available in the WTO. In this connection the WTO undertook to establish Reference Centres on the multilateral trading system. This comprised the procurement of computer equipment, internet connectivity, and training on how to access CD ROMs that were made available at that time. By December 1998, WTO Reference Centres had been established in all LDC countries. The WTO Web Site contained 11,000 pages about the rules and mechanisms of the multilateral trading system, legal texts, latest news on the WTO, schedules of meetings, the Document Dissemination Facility, and much other information. At present, there were over 100, 000 user visits on the Web Site per month, from about 140 countries, including an increasing number from LDCs. A second web site made available through the WTO reference centre was the Information Technologies for Development (ITD) website. The ITD was a joint initiative of the WTO and the Economic Development Institute of the World Bank which focused on the relationship of trade to social and economic development. Comments on issues were illustrated through case studies, inter-active guides, and on-line conference facilities. A third web-site available was the LDC web-site, established in the context of the Integrated Framework for Trade-related Technical Assistance to LDCs. The site was a management tool for the six International Agencies who were dealing with the Integrated Framework, and also served as a communications tool for stakeholders in the process. Finally, when the WTO Reference Centres were established, users were also provided with a number of electronic publications as CD ROM products. These included the results of the Uruguay Round, the Guide to GATT Law and Practice, the Analytical index, the GATT BISD, Trade Policy Review Collection, WTO Trade Statistics, and a CD representing the WTO Internet Site at a certain cut-off date.","WTCOMTDM24.pdf","Director, Technical, Cooperation, Division, Léger, WTO, WTO, WTO, WTO, WTO, WTO, WTO, Information, Technologies, for, Development, WTO, Economic, Development, Institute, of, the, World, Bank, Integrated, Framework, for, Trade-related, Technical, Assistance, Integrated, Framework, WTO, Uruguay, Round, GATT, GATT, WTO, Trade, Statistics, WTO"
"1895",1895,"74","74.    The paper also included a section on improved communications, and the introduction of IT as a means of reducing times, distances and costs, insofar as communications with developing countries                                                                                   WT/COMTD/M/24                                                                                          Page 11 are concerned, through the use of e-mail, on line fora and video conferencing. All these had a multiplier effect in terms of the number of people reached and allowed the WTO to enhance the scope and coverage of it's technical assistance. All staff in the Secretariat had e-mail, and generic e-mail addresses had been established, for notifications are concerned and for the WTO reference centre help desk. Insofar as on-line fora were concerned, several had already taken place: for instance a conference on intellectual property rights took place over a period of 5 months with over 300 registered participants. A second conference, entitled ""The WTO and Developing Countries"" was under way. A third one on regionalism was due to begin in the first week of March. Two types of video conferencing were possible: point to point connections, or multi-point links. Video conferencing was seen as an important tool for lecturing, question and answer sessions, as well as for technical missions. Examples included a short term trade policy course held in Turin in October 1998, and a video conference on notifications held in February 1999, which involved 65 officials in four different countries – Malawi, Kenya, Ghana and Zimbabwe.","WTCOMTDM24.pdf","WTO, Secretariat, WTO, WTO, Turin, Malawi, Kenya, Ghana, Zimbabwe"
"1896",1896,"75","75.      Furthermore, the Secretariat already made use of computer based presentations in the delivery of technical assistance. Videos prepared for the press could be used for technical cooperation activities, and the WTO had a training package providing a comprehensive exposure to the WTO that was accessible on the WTO Web-Site. Computer Based Training was available on CD ROM, capturing the contents of WTO Trade Policy courses in multi-media mode, with a pilot already available on textiles and clothing. The secretariat had made use of the World Bank Learning Network, now established in some 40 countries, for instance in conjunction with the video conference on notifications. Web Casting technology had also been used for the first time in conjunction with the WTO Ministerial Meeting of May 1998 and would be used during the High Level Symposia on Trade and Environment and Trade and Development to be held in March 1999. Web Casting allowed for participation in events on-line when physical presence was not possible. Distance Learning could augment the impact of technical cooperation activities, and could be seen as part of a wider intellectual information technology based programme centred on capacity building. The Secretariat also foresaw the use of Information Technology in the holding of ""virtual meetings"", which could be used to promote the exchange of views by trade officials.","WTCOMTDM24.pdf","Secretariat, WTO, WTO, WTO, Web-Site, WTO, World, Bank, Learning, Network, WTO, Environment, and, Trade, and, Development, Secretariat, Information, Technology"

He recalled that the reason motivating his delegation's request for a paper was the recognition by the Director General and others that the WTO information technology system was complex and that work was required to render it accessible to delegations and those not well versed in information technology. The representative of Egypt recognised that tremendous progress had been achieved. He noted that the paper contained several important sections of interest to his delegation. He cited as an example the delivery of Trade Policy Courses in electronic form, which would serve to meet the strong demand for such courses in his country. His delegation would reflect on the paper further, and revert to the issue of information technology in the delivery of technical assistance at a future meeting.","WTCOMTDM24.pdf","Egypt, Director, Technical, Cooperation, Division, Director, WTO, Egypt"

First, in relation to paragraph 5 of the document WT/COMTD/W/59 concerning password protection of restricted documents, he asked whether passwords were available to both delegations and capitals, as his delegation had at times tried and failed to access restricted documents. Second, he asked whether the Secretariat had a strategy to ensure that LDCs would be able adapt to and keep pace with changes in software and hardware technology.

She said that the acceptance of her delegation was limited to the next meeting of the CTD, and that this decision would be reviewed when the nine organisations presented their requests for Observer Status again to the CTD. She added that the United States had submitted a proposal to the General Council for the conduct of consultations on guidelines for granting permanent Observer Status. She said that the United States treated the granting of Observer Status as a serious issue, and were very interested in the General Council Chairman's work on this subject, adding that any decision on the granting of permanent Observer Status in the CTD should await the completion of the General Council's work on the issue.","WTCOMTDM24.pdf","United, States, Members, CTD, CTD, CTD, United, States, General, Council, United, States, General, Council, Chairman, CTD, General, Council"

He said that Bangladesh was a big user of technical assistance, and added that the technical assistance package should be strengthened in some of it's aspect. His delegation had repeatedly asked that the number of Trade Policy Courses be increased to allow a larger intake of participants. He noted that the technical assistance budget depended on ad hoc grants from donors, and that this did not facilitate forward planning. His delegation appealed to developed Member donors to streamline procedures with respect to funding the technical assistance budget, and asked that the level of funding be increased. He highlighted the value of internships, and urged developed members to initiate programmes for trainees from LDCs. His delegation also favoured the equitable distribution amongst LDCs of the facilities available under the technical assistance programme.","WTCOMTDM24.pdf","Bangladesh, Secretariat, Bangladesh, Member"

Her delegation joined others in recognising the improvements in WTO technical assistance programmes, and drew the attention of the meeting to the question of language. Recognising that while the web site contained a wealth of information, most of it was in English. WTO members needed to have documents in all three official languages. Further investments had to be made to ensure that document dissemination was undertaken consistent with the trilingual policy of the WTO.","WTCOMTDM24.pdf","Cuba, Secretariat, WTO, WTO, WTO"

VII.    EVALUATION OF TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE","WTCOMTDM24.pdf","Chairman, Secretariat, Norway, Hong, Kong, China"
"1906",1906,"84","84.       The Chairman said that the evaluation of WTO Technical Assistance Programmes was now a constant feature of the agenda of this Committee. At the 22nd Session of the CTD, the Secretariat circulated an issues paper (Job No: 4299) to assist reflection on the subject. The paper referred to the guidelines for technical cooperation and training, examined ways and means of assessing technical cooperation, made a distinction between internal and external evaluation, and addressed evaluation criteria.","WTCOMTDM24.pdf","Chairman, WTO, Technical, Assistance, Programmes, Committee, CTD, Secretariat"
"1907",1907,"85","85.      Informal consultations took place on this item on 23 November 1998. At the 23rd Session of the CTD, Members agreed that any approach to the evaluation of WTO technical cooperation should be simple, objective, transparent and practical. Possible approaches could combine quantitative and qualitative approaches and could comprise internal as well as external audits. Members agreed to consult informally in order to develop evaluation modalities. These informal consultations took place on 17 December 1998. In the light of a series of consultations, including the Deputy                                                                                    WT/COMTD/M/24                                                                                           Page 13 Director-Director's consultations on 25 January 1999, the Secretariat produced revised proposals for two questionnaires for the evaluation of WTO Technical Cooperation programmes. These proposals were contained in document WT/COMTD/W/58, which had been circulated. The Chairman called on the Director of the Technical Cooperation Division, to introduce the documents.","WTCOMTDM24.pdf","CTD, Members, WTO, Members, Director-Director, Secretariat, WTO, Chairman, Director, Technical, Cooperation, Division"
"1908",1908,"86","86.      The Director of the Technical Cooperation Division, Mr Léger, recalled that members had agreed that the approach to evaluation of technical assistance should be simple, objective, transparent and practical. A representative of the ITC had been present at the informal meeting of 17 December 1998. Based on comments and suggestions made at this meeting, the two questionnaires had been revised, refined and circulated. The two questionnaires were designed to provide information regarding activities held in beneficiary countries, including the possible impact of assistance provided and expected follow up. The assessment would be part of the feedback process and would be beneficial to the operation of future activities on technical assistance. This note prepared by the Secretariat should be seen as a first step in the evaluation process and cover data collection only. It was developed taking into account the guidelines for the evaluation of WTO technical cooperation, adopted by the CTD on 15 October 1996, and the instruments outlined in the implementation modules of 17 October 1997.","WTCOMTDM24.pdf","Director, Technical, Cooperation, Division, Mr, Léger, ITC, Secretariat, WTO, CTD"
"1909",1909,"87","87.      WTO Technical Assistance now occupied an increasingly important place in overall WTO activities. In 1998, over 3000 technical cooperation activities took place, amounting to some Sfr.5 million, of which 80 per cent was financed through extra budgetary resources. This compared with the 79 activities undertaken with a budget of Sfr.700,000 in 1997. The current average duration of a national technical assistance activity was three to five days, at a cost of less than Sfr.20,000. Regional seminars lasted on average ten working days, at an average cost of Sfr.150,000. In the WTO, many technical cooperation activities were geared towards human and institutional capacity building, whereby the effects of the assistance could expected to be measured over time.","WTCOMTDM24.pdf","WTO, WTO, WTO"
"1910",1910,"88","88.      In order to begin assessing the impact of technical assistance, two evaluation forms had been developed which would be used simultaneously by WTO officials. The first form was entitled ""Country Request and Evaluation Form"" and would be completed in part by the Secretariat and in part by the country benefiting from technical cooperation. This form would capture all technical information that pertained to the event taking place, including the definition of the objectives of the activity to be carried out. At the conclusion of each event, the representatives of the beneficiary country would assess the activity and proceed with follow up. Further contact would take place with the country three to six months following the event to assess the impact of the activity, given that certain activities took time to bear fruit. The second questionnaire entitled ""Participant Evaluation and Feedback Form"" was intended to improve the quality of WTO technical cooperation through feedback by participants. It would also serve as feedback on how to improve further the delivery of technical cooperation. He reminded Members that these two questionnaires would be refined and extended as more experience was gained. In order to assess the effectiveness of technical assistance given, it was proposed to analyse the information by topic covered, assess the information by country, by region and sub-region, as well as by mode of delivery. The questionnaires would be used, if accepted, as of July 1999, with the possibility of having a first evaluation on the basis of these forms in the spring of 2000.","WTCOMTDM24.pdf","WTO, Secretariat, WTO, Members"
"1911",1911,"89","89.      The document also had a section on the evaluation of joint programmes and activities with other organisations. In this instance, the Integrated Framework for Trade-related Technical Assistance and the Global Trade Analysis Project were refered to, in which the WTO contributed with other international organisations in the development and conduct of technical assistance. In this regard, the evaluation would be part of the overall evaluation stipulated in the joint programmes. The WTO also contributed as expert in the activities and programmes of the World Bank, WIPO, and other agencies. The impact of the WTO's participation could not be evaluated in isolation but only as part of the other activities which took place. At present, the WTO Secretariat was directly WT/COMTD/M/24 Page 14 accountable to donors for the use of their funds. Each year, the WTO reported individually to each donor in accordance with the memoranda of understanding signed with each donor. Attempts were being made to identify in more detail how the funds were used and their expected impact on the countries benefiting from assistance.","WTCOMTDM24.pdf","Integrated, Framework, for, Trade-related, Technical, Assistance, Global, Trade, Analysis, Project, WTO, WTO, World, Bank, WIPO, WTO, WTO, Secretariat, WTO"

"1913",1913,"90","90.      The representative of Switzerland said his delegation appreciated the Secretariat's efforts to develop an effective method of technical co-operation. He agreed that, in some ways, WTO technical assistance activities were not comparable to those carried out by other agencies owing to differences in duration and financial cost. However the Secretariat could still take advantage of the experience of other agencies in the field of technical cooperation and it's assessment. His delegation strongly recommended that cooperation with other agencies should continue. Questionnaires could only provide partial evaluation, and were in general not the most effective instrument. Switzerland did not fundamentally oppose a questionnaire-based approach, but did recommend that other instruments could be used. Evaluation, ideally, did not begin with the setting up of standard questionnaires, but with a clear definition of projects and their objectives, inputs, outputs, assumptions, and measurement indicators. Detailed proposals in this respect had been made in an informal note by the Swiss delegation distributed on 25 January 1999.","WTCOMTDM24.pdf","Switzerland, Secretariat, WTO, Secretariat, Switzerland"
"1914",1914,"91","91.     The representative of Switzerland drew the attention of the meeting to the wording of paragraph 18 of WT/COMTD/W/58, which seemed to suggest that the Integrated Framework for Trade-Related Technical Assistance was itself a technical assistance project, whereas the Secretariat had emphasised clearly, at the meeting of the Sub-Committee on Least-Developed Countries of 1 March 1999, the difference between the Integrated Framework for Trade-related Technical Assistance itself and specific technical assistance projects. He hoped that the wording in WT/COMTD/W/58 was simply a textual error and did not reflect a misunderstanding by the Secretariat of the concept of the Integrated Framework for Trade-Related Technical Assistance.","WTCOMTDM24.pdf","Switzerland, Integrated, Framework, for, Trade-Related, Technical, Assistance, Secretariat, Integrated, Framework, for, Trade-related, Technical, Assistance, Secretariat, Integrated, Framework, for, Trade-Related, Technical, Assistance"
"1915",1915,"92","92.      In response to these points, the Director of the Technical Cooperation Division said that a distinction needed to be made between an integrated response and an integrated framework. The Integrated Framework was an integrated response by six different international organisations to meet the needs of LDCs on a country basis. When conducting a technical mission to LDCs, the Secretariat's intention at the outset was to make use of the two questionnaire forms. In addition, the information would be inputted into the Integrated Framework in order to asses the extent to which the integrated response made by the six different organisations had been successful in meeting the needs of the LDC. Thus, while a distinction could be drawn between framework and response through a project, the two ideas were related.","WTCOMTDM24.pdf","Director, Technical, Cooperation, Division, Secretariat, Integrated, Framework"
"1916",1916,"93","93.      The representative of Norway thanked the Secretariat for preparing the note on evaluating WTO technical assistance, and the two evaluation forms. Her delegation had on several occasions argued in favour of putting in place a system to evaluate WTO technical cooperation. The document WT/COMTD/W/58 reflected discussions held by members in the autumn of 1998, and the agreement members that the WTO's approach to evaluation should be simple, objective, transparent and practical. Her delegation was of the view that the proposed questionnaires were in line with these criteria, though the questionnaires would possibly need refinement in the future once sufficient experience of their use in evaluation had been gained. She said evaluation was a learning by doing process, and that having discussed the issue at a theoretical level, it was now time to proceed in practical terms. If the CTD was in a position to endorse the questionnaires soon, the Secretariat could start applying the questionnaire by July 1999, and could provide a first evaluation report by early 2000. Her delegation was prepared to give the Secretariat green light for the use of the questionnaires, and to refine the questionnaires in the course of their use.","WTCOMTDM24.pdf","Norway, Secretariat, WTO, WTO, WTO, CTD, Secretariat, Secretariat"
"1917",1917,"94","94.     The representative of the European Communities noted that the document rightly related to the evaluation of technical assistance provided by the WTO Secretariat only, and did not cover all the                                                                                      WT/COMTD/M/24                                                                                             Page 15 other integrated activities. She wished to know whether she was correct in assuming that the contents of the document provided the basis, if approved, for a first report, probably by early 2000, following which the CTD would then consider how to proceed with more in depth evaluation. She also requested that the Secretariat elaborate on how it intended to incorporate responses to questionnaires into a feedback process as referred to in paragraph 2 of the document. Concerning the questionnaires themselves, and the country form, she said it would be useful to add a box entitled ""Success Indicators and Performance Targets"", in order to measure results against targets. She also drew the attention of the meeting to questions 6(a) and 6(b) of the feedback form noting that two sets of responses were necessary. She said her delegation would be interested to hear about the work of the task force on technical cooperation and the follow up to the Deputy Director-General's report. Finally, her delegation supported the suggestion made by Norway that the Secretariat use the tools already available to start the evaluation process, while remaining open to making adjustments as needed.","WTCOMTDM24.pdf","European, Communities, WTO, Secretariat, CTD, Secretariat, Director-General, Norway, Secretariat"
"1918",1918,"95","95.      The representative of Pakistan thanked the Secretariat for the document. He agreed with the representative of Egypt in underlining the usefulness of Trade Policy Course, which proved to be very popular amongst developing countries. He said that technical assistance delivered by WTO consultants and experts through short term seminars and symposia in developing countries had a limited impact when compared with the benefits received by participants from a three-four month course at the Secretariat headquarters. Given that the WTO agreements were not widely understood in Pakistan, and the need to train both government officials and private sector actors, he raised the possibility of increasing the length of visits by WTO experts and consultants to developing countries to a period of one month, to enhance the impact of the interaction between experts and recipients of technical assistance.","WTCOMTDM24.pdf","Pakistan, Secretariat, Egypt, WTO, Secretariat, WTO, Pakistan, WTO"
"1919",1919,"96","96.      The representative of New Zealand joined the delegations of Norway and the European Communities in supporting the questionnaires and their use, starting in July, adding that the questionnaires satisfied the criteria of simplicity, transparency, objectivity and practicality. She said that while evaluation was not in itself adequate to ensure good technical assistance, the questionnaires were an effective tool in gauging whether the pitch of WTO technical assistance was at the right level for the participants involved. This would be an important first step in ensuring that technical assistance programmes continue to be effective. Her delegation welcomed the section in the questionnaire regarding the identification of follow up activities, since it was likely that an individual seminar would highlight the need for further concrete technical assistance. With reference to Section V of the document concerning actions undertaken jointly by the WTO and others agencies, her delegation held the view that, although there was a need to distinguish WTO performance from that of other agencies, the general forms of evaluation as set out in the questionnaires could still be useful in the assessment of some joint activities. Suitable modifications could be made, the questionnaires would not need to be strictly audited or form part of the overall evaluation report, but could nevertheless be a useful instrument in ensuring the success of joint technical assistance activities.","WTCOMTDM24.pdf","New, Zealand, Norway, WTO, WTO, WTO"
"1920",1920,"97","97.     The representative of Tanzania thanked the Secretariat for submitting the evaluation forms, and said his delegation would support them. Given that the timely circulation of documents was important to the success of seminars and conferences, he suggested that in paragraph 7 of the feedback form, a question be inserted to allow participants to indicate whether documentation had been circulated in a timely fashion or not.","WTCOMTDM24.pdf","Tanzania, Secretariat"
"1921",1921,"98","98.     The representative of Djibouti thanked both the Members who contributed towards WTO technical assistance, as well as the Secretariat. He said WTO experts should communicate clearly to LDCs the importance of the multilateral trading system, and that there should be more seminars organised at a regional and national level. Attention should be given to assessing the impact of seminars held on government policy actions. WT/COMTD/M/24 Page 16","WTCOMTDM24.pdf","Djibouti, Members, WTO, Secretariat, WTO"
"1922",1922,"99","99.      The representative of Egypt thanked the Secretariat for the paper. He said that there were difficulties in evaluating joint programmes, which at the moment tended not be evaluated at all. He recalled that his delegation had been requesting an evaluation of the Integrated Framework for the last two years, and the question had arisen as to whether technical assistance should be requested under a programme that had never been evaluated. The representative of Egypt recalled his delegation's request for information on conditions attached to donor funds provided to the technical assistance budget, and hoped the Director of the Technical Cooperation Division could provide some information on this. His delegation also wished to know whether the possibility existed for translating WTO documentation into Arabic, and how this could be financed and what procedures should be followed. Finally, he said his delegation did not believe that the CTD needed to endorse the questionnaires for the evaluation of technical assistance. Hence the Secretariat should proceed in using them, while keeping the CTD informed of any modifications made.","WTCOMTDM24.pdf","Egypt, Secretariat, Integrated, Framework, Egypt, Director, WTO, CTD, Secretariat, CTD"

The chairperson had consulted with Members on the two applications on 1April 1999, and it was understood that these two IGOs should, beginning with the CTD's 25th Session, also be accorded ad hoc observer status on a meeting-by-meeting basis. Pursuant to the understanding by Members on 1 April 1999, (WIPO) and ECOWAS had been invited to this meeting.","WTCOMTDM25.pdf","Chairperson, CTD, Committee, Intergovernmental, Organizations, Committee, Committee, World, Intellectual, Property, Organization, WIPO, Economic, Community, of, West, ECOWAS, Members, Members, CTD, Members, WIPO, ECOWAS"
"1929",1929,"100","100.     The first family of clusters was aimed at strengthening the capacity of countries to understanding the multilateral trading system amd its implications for external trade. The essence of the activities in this family was to help countries in comprehending the emerging trading environment and to define the field in which businesses truly operated. Within the first family, there were two clusters: the first dealt with developing a knowledge of the multilateral trading system and its implications while the second dealt with the impact of the multilateral trading system on the national economy and adaptation of external trade policy.","WTCOMTDM25.pdf",""
"1930",1930,"101","101.     The second family addressed the issue of adjusting the national trade legislation so that it conformed to the multilateral trading system and regulations, and also had two clusters. Under the first of these, technical assistance was given on all matters relating to customs, while under the second, assistance was given for adjusting the legal framework of a country's external trade so that it was in line with the rules of the multilateral trading system.","WTCOMTDM25.pdf",""
"1931",1931,"102","102.     The third family dealt with enhancing the export readiness of enterprises. It was, by the nature of work that needed to be done, a large family. It sought to lay the foundation for development of exports from a country and to give practical help at the enterprise level. To understand the third family, it was best to see it as comprising two components. The first dealt with providing support at the strategic level while the second dealt with building capacity at the operational level, so that enterprises actually involved in exporting goods and services could compete effectively in the rapidly globalizing world economy. The strategic component itself had three clusters. Under the first cluster, export supply and market potential, the trade prospects of counties were analysed on the basis of their national export performance and the evaluation of international demand and supply. Under the second cluster, training for strategy formulation, countries received help in order to identify for themselves products that could be exported and markets in which they could be sold. Under the third cluster, sectoral strategies were prepared for the main export subsectors and product groups, and technical advice was to be given to exporting enterprises to enable them to define company-specific business strategies and plans. At the operational level, work was undertaken in four clusters. In the first two clusters, namely trade information, national enquiry points and quality management, support was given to create an enabling environment for the enterprise to operate so that they have access to necessary business infrastructure to conduct their business efficiently and effectively. Under the last two clusters, namely trade secrets and export financing, efforts were directed at the enterprises themselves giving them support in areas of critical importance, in for instance, how to approach export markets and finance their export activity, negotiate with banks and so forth.","WTCOMTDM25.pdf",""
"1932",1932,"103","103.    The fourth family provided the support to ensure that the capacity built under the other three families is maintained even after the programme came to an end. This family also had four clusters. The ""programme management"" cluster had a number of activities undertaken to ensure that various components of the programme were synchronised and activities and outputs were delivered jointly in a timely manner in accordance with the programme plan. The ""reference centre"" cluster ensured that up to date technical information on the multilateral trading system was readily available to various users such as government ministries, national institutions, and private sector enterprises. The cluster that dealt with networking of partners facilitated the smooth flow of information among programme partners on JITAP's various components using the latest technology tools; and in the human resource development/capacity building cluster activities were aimed at ensuring that appropriate training WT/COMTD/M/25 Page 26 material is developed and made available to all users, and that required skills are developed in the concerned institutions.","WTCOMTDM25.pdf","JITAP"
"1933",1933,"104","104.    Mr. Vijay said that taken together, all clusters and families gave simultaneous and sequential actions at three levels in order to achieve the three objectives of the programme. The capacity developed under the three families was sustained by the work done under the fourth family – support family – where each of the three organisations namely the ITC, the WTO, and the UNCTAD, were involved. The fourth family acted as a backbone for supporting the entire programme which derived its main synergy benefit from it. There were links between clusters. For instance, work done in the export supply and market potential cluster was used in the cluster dealing with sector/product strategy. This was an example of links between clusters of the same family. However, there were many linkages between clusters belonging to different families. For instance, work done under the export supply and market potential cluster fed directly into the cluster dealing with the impact of the multilateral trading system on the national economy, which in turn provided inputs into the sector/product strategy cluster. Likewise, work done under the cluster ""adjustment to trade laws and regulations"" informed tasks undertaken under the impact of the multilateral trading system on the national economy and vice versa.","WTCOMTDM25.pdf","Vijay, ITC, WTO"
"1934",1934,"105","105.    Mr. Vijay said that work done by the ITC under the cluster relating to trade analysis provided inputs to the cluster dealing with the impact of the multilateral trading system on the national economy, which provided a key input to the national symposium in the field, in which all parties were involved to identify strategic trade options. Revised trade policies in line with WTO rules were developed in order to create an enabling environment in which enterprises could flourish and help in formulating appropriate sector strategies, which then provided an input into the strategies and business plans of the enterprises which were actually involved in exporting. JITAP generated information both of a qualitative and quantitative nature on a massive scale. To ensure that synergistic benefits accrued in a cumulative manner and valuable lessons learnt by some participants were readily available to all when needed, an innovative Internet-based communication and discussion facility was to be set up under JITAP. Mr. Vijay handed the floor to Mr. Ben Fadhl to present this facility.","WTCOMTDM25.pdf","Vijay, ITC, WTO, JITAP, Vijay, Ben, Fadhl"
"1935",1935,"106","106.     Mr. Ben Fadhl said that the JITAP was quite complex, given the large number of players and the heavy information flows generated by programme partners and network of trainers. The problem was compounded by numerous communication difficulties and high operating costs. These challenges had to be overcome by networking and using modern communication technologies, to create a tool for management and information exchange, that can be used readily by all parties concerned, and this was the Communication and Discussion Facility (CDF). The CDF had four modules: the exchange of documents module, which provided access to information by JITAP partners; the question-answers module, which enabled any participating user to raise a question on the web site and have a reply by an appropriate resource person; the online discussion module, which was a JITAP chat-room where day-to-day technical issues were discussed; and the newsgroup module, where JITAP teams periodically initiated thematic discussions or exchanged ideas on selected subjects. The address was JITAP.ORG. Once the home page was reached, one would have the choice of surfing in French or English, though at the moment the prototype operated only in English. Once one had entered the CDF, one could choose between functions that were grouped in four sections: key information dealt with the programme and participating countries; CDF modules - the already mentioned; links to relevant sites; and utilities. If one visited ""key information"" a number of documents which could be reviewed or downloaded were available for each country. The visitor of JITAP.ORG could review the implementation plan for that country, obtain a list of National Steering Committee members and their contact addresses, and so forth. It was possible to examine information under implementation under various clusters. The question and answer module enabled to post a question or review answers given. The module on documents exchange allowed the transmission of documents electronically, rather than faxing them or sending them by courier.

"1936",1936,"107","107.     Mr. Dagata concluded by reviewing the key characteristics of the JITAP as compared with the Integrated Framework for LDCs. JITAP was a distinctive, concrete programme of assistance while the Integrated Framework was mainly a structure and a set of processes to co-ordinate assistance, although it did lead to a coordinated group of activities. JITAP was at present an Africa programme, while the Integrated Framework covered the world. JITAP covered both LDCs and non-LDCs in Africa while the Integrated Framework was by definition restricted to LDCs. The three Geneva institutions were currently the only JITAP executing agencies, and they also participated in the integrated framework with other core agencies. There were four JITAP LDCs which also fell within the scope of the Integrated Framework.","WTCOMTDM25.pdf","Dagata, Integrated, Framework, for, LDCs, Africa, Integrated, Framework, Africa, Geneva, Integrated, Framework"
"1937",1937,"108","108.     Mr. Dagata proceeded to introduce the Integrated Framework. The Integrated Framework for trade-related technical assistance to LDCs was endorsed by the October 1997 High-Level Meeting on LDCs. The core agencies were the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank, the UNDP, and the three Geneva institutions. They formed an interagency working group, under the chairmanship of the WTO, supported by the Administrative Unit housed at the ITC. Other multilateral and bilateral partners active in trade-related assistance were now participating the Integrated Framework process to arrive at a truly comprehensive, cooperation framework. The 48 least-developed countries were heavily concentrated in Africa, but there were a large number in Asia as well. A website - LDCS.ORG – supported the IF process. The site was a key and unique information tool providing transparency for the process. The starting-point of the IF process was the country's needs assessment. The core agencies addressed those needs in an integrated response. Other multilateral and bilateral agencies had been invited to broaden the integrated response, and several had done so. Subsequently, the LDC should schedule a trade-related Round Table meeting, where it presented in a strategic setting, its needs assessment , the integrated response, and requested assistance. At the meeting, development partners should officially announce their interest in supporting elements of a multi-year country-specific programme of trade-related assistance.","WTCOMTDM25.pdf","Dagata, International, Monetary, Fund, World, Bank, UNDP, Geneva, WTO, ITC, Africa, Asia, LDC"
"1938",1938,"109","109.    So far, 40 needs assessments and the corresponding Integrated Responses had been prepared. Over 20 countries were planning for a trade-related Round Table and were in various stages of preparation. One Round Table had been held in December 1998 in Uganda. It had become clear that the round table process was not moving as quickly initially expected. Accordingly, the Administrative Unit was asked early this year to develop a model Round Table document, which had now been disseminated to all LDCs. Without compromising ownership, the agencies were now taking a more proactive approach to getting round tables set up, including facilitating launch workshops and the national preparation of round table documents. Thirteen Round Table Meetings were currently scheduled for 1999, though this was understandably subject to change. In Angola, preparations were at an early stage, and the UNDP was helping. In Bangladesh, the World Bank was helping to organise a launch workshop in Dhaka on 23 June 1999. The next meeting of the Inter-Agency Working Group was also scheduled to be held in Dhaka after the workshop. In Bhutan, help in preparing the meeting was principally from UNDP and ITC. In Djibouti, following preparatory missions by the WTO, the UNCTAD and the ITC, the Round Table Meeting could take place in the autumn. In Ethiopia, a Round Table document had been circulated; the World Bank was providing support. In Gambia, the meeting would take place within a broader UNDP-supported meeting, also focussing on private sector development and agriculture. In Guinea, the meeting was planned in conjunction with a meeting on private sector development. A joint mission of the Bank, the UNCTAD and the UNDP would help prepare it. In Haiti, consultants under a UNDP/UNCTAD project were helping to prepare documentation. In Mozambique, preparations were still at an early stage. Nepal would also attend the launch workshop in Dhaka. In Niger, a broader UNDP Round Table would include discussions on the trade sector and private sector development. In Tanzania, a meeting was being pursued with the support of the World Bank, following recommendations of a consultative group meeting in may. In Zambia, discussion was under way with core agencies. Finally, there was interest in having a meeting in Malawi.

The Chairperson therefore proposed that the CTD should invite WIPO and ECOWAS to participate at this meeting as observers on an ad hoc basis and that the CTD agree to invite to its next meeting on an ad hoc and on a meeting-by-meeting basis the 11 following IGOs:         (i)      Arab Maghreb Union;         (ii)     Economic Community of West Africa States (ECOWAS);         (iii)    Economic Cooperation Organization (ECO);         (iv)     Inter-Arab Investment Guarantee Corporation;         (v)      Islamic Development Bank (IDB);         (vi)     Organization of African Unity (OAU);         (vii)    Organization of the Islamic Conference (OIC);         (viii)   South Centre;         (ix)     South Pacific Forum (SPF);         (x)      West African Economic and Monetary Union (WAEMU); and         (xi)     World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO)","WTCOMTDM25.pdf","Chairperson, CTD, WIPO, ECOWAS, CTD, West, Africa, States, ECOWAS, Economic, Cooperation, Organization, Inter-Arab, Investment, Guarantee, Corporation, Islamic, Development, Bank, Organization, of, African, Unity, OAU, OIC, South, Centre, South, Pacific, West, African, Economic, and, Monetary, Union, WAEMU, World, Intellectual, Property, Organization, WIPO"
"1940",1940,"110","110.    Mr. Dagata said that another measure of progress was what the six core agencies had accomplished in carrying out their respective parts of the integrated responses. Agencies had already addressed almost half of the 2,000 needs they agreed to pursue in the Integrated Responses. These responses typically included IMF missions to review and update customs legislation, ITC buyers-sellers meetings, UNCTAD consultancies on trade policy issues, World Bank advisory missions to improve national frameworks, and WTO specialised national and regional workshops. Progress had also been made in reducing the overlap and fostering synergies among core agencies. Several of the integrated responses were joint responses involving two or more agencies. Less tangibly, the Integrated Framework had also sensitised partners to the importance of trade-related assistance, and had given it more visibility on the development agenda. this was resulting in enhanced effectiveness in the delivery of technical assistance. All of this would be considered in an eventual evaluation of the value-added of the Integrated Framework approach.","WTCOMTDM25.pdf","Dagata, IMF, ITC, UNCTAD, World, Bank, WTO, Integrated, Framework, Integrated, Framework"
"1941",1941,"111","111.     Mr. Geoffroy of the Integrated Framework Administrative Unit briefly presented the Integrated Framework website. He said the website had been prepared with very simple graphics, so as to facilitate the downloading of information in LDCs. The site became operational in September 1998, and had received almost 9,000 hits at an average of 50 hits a day. The upper left part of the front page contained the main menu, while the core information on the process for every single LDC was contained under the heading ""Country-Specific Programmes"". Once a participating country had been selected, a full menu was accessible with rubrics such as the national focal point, needs assessment and so forth. The national focal point was normally a senior official within a relevant Ministry of the LDC. The needs assessment paper contained the country's economic analysis covering all trade development constraints and identified the technical assistance needs. The integrated response page was divided into three columns; the left column stating the technical assistance needs listed in the needs assessment page, the middle column gaving the name of the core agency meeting the need identified, and the right hand column briefly describing the response of the core agency. The Status of Implementation page reflected the status of implementation in the LDC. Updating of the report on implementation was made regularly by the agencies every 6-8 months and communicated to the Administrative Unit for its electronic dissemination.              The page on communication by other development partners listed the trade-related assistance the country was receiving from other multilateral partners and bilateral agencies. The page ""Status of Preparation of Round Tables"" provided information on the timing of the meeting, the venue and the lead agency assisting the country in preparing for the event. The Round Table document was disseminated in advance to all interested parties in real time through the website. Returning to the main menu, the page ""programme participants"" provided information on the main group of actors, that is the LDCs, the six core agencies, and other development partners. The page ""core group of organisations"" made available information on six core agencies. The section ""other development partners"" contained information on multilateral and bilateral partners. Under the multilaterals sub-heading, information on 12 agencies active in trade-related technical assistance to LDCs was presented. Under the heading Inter-Agency Group, the coordinates of the focal points of the six core agencies was provided. Under the heading official document, a selection of the most important Integrated Framework documents was provided, and under the headings ""process at a glance"", ""coming events"" and ""what's new?"", information on the most important steps for participating LDCs was provided in a summarised way.","WTCOMTDM25.pdf","Geoffroy, Integrated, Framework, Administrative, Unit, Administrative, Unit, Inter-Agency, Group, Integrated, Framework"

The Chairperson invited Mr. Jean-Maurice Léger, Director, Technical Cooperation Division to make an important statement on the present critical financial situation, which has potentially                                                                                      WT/COMTD/M/25                                                                                             Page 29 serious effects for WTO technical cooperation activities.

"1944",1944,"114","114.     The Director of the Technical Cooperation Division said the purpose of his presentation was to give a review of the technical cooperation activities that took place in 1998, and also the budget situation, as of 31 of May 1999, for the year 1999. There had been a fourfold increase in the number of technical cooperation activities between 1995 and 1998. In the first five months of 1999, 141 activities had been conducted. This rate of increase was not sustainable, owing to financial and human resource constraints. Furthermore, the preparations for the Seattle Ministerial Conference, and the ensuing negotiations, would require that WTO would have to be present in Geneva to service these negotiations. He also recalled that the workload of operational divisions consisted primarily in servicing working groups and committees; dealing with dispute settlement panels; providing day to day technical assistance to delegations in Geneva; and only when time and resources permitted the undertaking of technical assistance missions outside Geneva.","WTCOMTDM25.pdf","Director, Technical, Cooperation, Division, Seattle, Ministerial, Conference, WTO, Geneva, Geneva, Geneva"
"1945",1945,"115","115.     Mr. Léger presented information on the geographic distribution of technical assistance activities for 1998, and noted that Africa continued to account for the largest number of activities. The 58 per cent increase in 1998 over 1997 resulted from activities under the Integrated Framework and JITAP, and also from the decision to establish WTO reference centres in LDCs. The numbers for Europe for both 1997 and 1998 were inflated insofar as they included all activities that took place at WTO headquarters, which activities covered developing countries in all regions. He said that the footnote pertaining to North America referred to short term trade policy courses that were geared to developing and least developed countries, that took place in Washington D.C., and that were financed by the Organisation of American States. Insofar as the Middle East was concerned, the increase was closer to 50 per cent, reflecting greater involvement of countries in this area of the globe, and also because there were a number of countries in the process of accession in this area. The WTO worked closely in the Middle East with the Islamic Development Bank, which had financed a number of activities.","WTCOMTDM25.pdf","Léger, Africa, WTO, Europe, WTO, North, America, Washington, D.C., Organisation, of, American, States, Middle, East, WTO, Middle, East, Islamic, Development, Bank"
"1946",1946,"116","116.     The Director of the Technical Cooperation Division said that whenever modes of delivery were discussed, attention needed to be given to the evolving nature of the multilateral rules based system, and in this context the need for at least three levels of activities. The first level consisted of the general dissemination of an overview of the WTO and its agreements. The second level represented more in depth upgrading of developing countries human resource skills in order to further improve their capacity to participate in the WTO and the decision-making process. The third level consisted of specialised knowledge required for the implementation of WTO agreements. Examples in this respect included the training of customs officials in customs evaluation methods, establishing enquiry points and conformity assessment procedures as required by the TBT, and risk assessment techniques under the SPS. It was also important to bear in mind that there was a continuous renewal in developing country administrations, with new government officials, thereby requiring repeats of WTO training programmes. Looking specifically at the figures, there had been an increase in regional seminars from 42 to 71, and a decrease in national seminars from 44 to 41. These results were in line with Members' requests to emphasise regional seminars. Although regional seminars reach a larger number of countries and permit the establishment of contacts with the authorities of participating countries, the cost of regional seminars was very much higher than the cost of national seminars. The cost of an average regional seminar in 1998 was CHF150,000, while the cost of the average national seminar was CHF20,000. Furthermore, the synergy that resulted from regional seminars was usually limited owing to the small number of national participants. Given that developing countries were increasingly concerned with implementation issues, it was likely that the number of national seminars would increase. National seminars served to identify more readily concerns at the country level, and the larger number of participants ensured a greater synergy once the activity had been completed and facilitated the assessment of the implications of agreements. The huge increase in technical seminars from 55 to 90 reflected the establishment of WTO reference centres, and also resulted from specific WT/COMTD/M/25 Page 30 request from Members to conduct specialized activities rather than general ones. The increase in workshops and symposia from 78 to 106 denoted the fact that the WTO had been increasingly in demand to participate in these events.","WTCOMTDM25.pdf","Director, Technical, Cooperation, Division, WTO, WTO, WTO, TBT, WTO, Members, WTO, Members, WTO"
"1947",1947,"117","117.     Mr. Léger added that two-thirds of all planned missions assigned for 1998 under the three-year plan were executed, compared to 50 per cent in 1997. However, activities coming under the three-year plan constituted only a third of all activities conducted in 1998. Although the three-year plan was of help, more rigorous planning was required by members. The number of activities not coming under the three-year plan (196) was in part explained by the fact that this was the first full year of operation of the three-year plan. Finally, the activities of the three-year plan not executed (58) were due to cancellation by host countries, or postponement for a variety of reasons. It needed to be made clear that many actors were involved in the conduct of a technical cooperation mission: the Technical Cooperation Division as the chief executing unit, the host country, funding resources, and in the case of the regional seminar, the beneficiary countries. The interaction between these various actors was an important factor in the cancellation or postponement of activities.","WTCOMTDM25.pdf","Léger, Technical, Cooperation, Division"
"1948",1948,"118","118.    Mr. Léger said that of the 140 activities fully organised by the WTO (which represented less than 50 per cent of all activities in which the WTO was involved), over half were undertaken by divisions other than the Technical Cooperation Division, though the latter acted as coordinator. By ""other institutions"" was meant those that were part of the JITAP process, those that were part of the Integrated Framework, and others. Activities to which the WTO was invited numbered 110, representing more than one-third of all activities in 1998. In a number of cases, costs – transportation costs and local expenses - were frequently borne by the WTO, and more was being done to have host organisations absorb these costs in the future.","WTCOMTDM25.pdf","Léger, WTO, WTO, Technical, Cooperation, Division, Integrated, Framework, WTO, WTO"
"1949",1949,"119","119.     The Director of the Technical Cooperation Division noted that the activities of the Division covered a number of subjects, which could be classified into 11 categories, including general seminars; goods; services; dispute settlement; intellectual property; trade and environment; implementation issues; regionalism; electronic commerce; and so forth. General seminars were defined as those where general dissemination of the WTO and its agreements took place. The number of activities under general seminars in 1998 numbered 80, reflecting a heightened interest in the activities of the WTO and the multilateral trading system. Activities on specific subjects were covered usually in workshops, specific seminars and technical missions. The total number of activities was greater than the total number of missions, given that in any one mission, it was possible that more than one activity be covered. Missions on accession reflected the increased demand for technical cooperation by countries in the process of accession to the WTO. The number of activities under information technologies for development, 37, reflected the installation of WTO reference centres. Activities on market access were mainly on the explanation and identification of market access conditions at the product and tariff line levels, and incorporated two training courses on trade negotiations skills. The large number of missions on customs valuation reflected the implementation date of the agreement by the year 2000. A number of countries in 1998 required assistance on the transposition of tariff schedules into the HS 1996 system. For reasons of cost efficiency, the Integrated Data Base had been dealt with in seminars on market access issues. Agriculture, textiles and clothing were important subjects for developing countries, and SPS and TBT were treated together in one single activity. In the area of rules, it was noteworthy that more requests for assistance were being received by the Secretariat. This was an area where the division concerned devoted a sizeable amount of time to technical assistance at headquarters, responding to daily questions and concerns by delegations. As already indicated, servicing committees and working groups, along with dispute settlement panels, constituted the priority area of work for the Secretariat in this domain. The main subject that was beginning to be covered substantially in technical assistance was the Agreement on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures. Particular attention was given to the issue of disciplines in notification requirements. In the area of trade in services, the                                                                                   WT/COMTD/M/25                                                                                          Page 31 Agreement was explained in general, as well as at the sectoral level, particularly with respect to financial services and telecommunications.","WTCOMTDM25.pdf","Director, Technical, Cooperation, Division, WTO, WTO, WTO, WTO, Integrated, Data, Base, SPS, TBT, Secretariat, Secretariat"

"1951",1951,"120","120.     Technical aspects of the scheduling of commitments were also dealt with in the course of technical assistance activities. Activities on TRIPS reflected the implementation date of the agreement in January 2000, and also the joint programme conducted with the WIPO. Activities under Dispute Settlement Understanding numbered 17, of which four were regional or sub-regional courses, while the others were at the national level. Activities under trade and environment reflected the holding of regional and sub-regional seminars announced in 1997 by the WTO. Regarding implementation issues, a number of requests had been made for legal advisors to screen national legislation to verify compliance with WTO agreements. Regarding notification requirements, specific seminars had been held. Regional integration was also a subject of increasing interest to developing countries, particularly those involved in negotiations on a regional, sub-regional or bilateral basis. Attention was given to the issue of consistency between regional, sub-regional and bilateral arrangements with WTO commitments. One activity had been held under the rubric of electronic commerce, though more were expected in the near future. There was interest in the role of electronic commerce within the WTO framework, as well as progress to date made on the work programme on electronic commerce.","WTCOMTDM25.pdf","WIPO, WTO, WTO, WTO, WTO"
"1952",1952,"121","121.    The Director of the Technical Cooperation Division said that in keeping with the Singapore Ministerial Declaration, the services of the division had been made available to developing country Members in the areas of trade and competition policy, and trade and investment. These activities had been conducted in connection with the UNCTAD and the World Bank,. there had also been a symposium on trade facilitation in 1998, and a number of missions had been conducted on transparency in government procurement. Lastly consultation with other international organisations covered JITAP and the Integrated Framework. The WTO was also in contact with a number of other agencies with a view to develop joint programmes.","WTCOMTDM25.pdf","Director, Technical, Cooperation, Division, Singapore, Members, UNCTAD, World, Bank, Integrated, Framework, WTO"
"1953",1953,"122","122.     With regard to the Integrated Framework, Mr. Léger drew attention to the input of the WTO. In 1998, 52 activities were held, 32 of which consisted in the establishment of national reference centres, seven national seminars, three meetings of the inter-agency working group, three meeting in the Round Table process, three regional seminars (one in Zambia for English-speaking African LDCs, one in Djibouti for French-speaking African LDCs, and one in Bangladesh for Asian and Pacific LDCs), and two short term policy courses for LDCs. Regarding the WTO contribution to the JITAP programme, there had been 23 missions, mostly concerning sessions on notification, implementation issues and the establishment of WTO reference centres.","WTCOMTDM25.pdf","Integrated, Framework, Léger, WTO, Zambia, Djibouti, Bangladesh, WTO, WTO"
"1954",1954,"123","123.     The Director of the Technical Cooperation Division presented the budget situation as of May 1999. The figures presented excluded the regular training courses of three months each amounting to CHF1.5 million. They also excluded donations from the United Kingdom for the consolidated tariffs schedule database, and for the financing of one position for one year in the Technical Cooperation Division to cover technical evaluation. His presentation assumed the disbursement of 1999 instalments yet to be disbursed by donors. He drew attention to the fact that the line ""WTO regular budget"" could only be used to cover travel and per diem expenses of WTO staff members. The regular budget, along with programme support fund, and the trust fund donations of CHF5.2 million for gave a total funding of CHF6.775 million. It could be seen therefore that roughly 10 per cent of technical cooperation activities were projected to be financed through the regular WTO budget. Regarding projected expenditure, close to 60 per cent of projected expenditures had been firmly committed. A number of reasons for this development could be posited, including the upcoming deadlines for the implementation of several agreements, the carryover of a number of activities from 1998, the extension of WTO reference centre programmes to small island economies, increasing requests for TBT and SPS seminars, general concerns related to the Singapore work programme, and preparations for the forthcoming Seattle Ministerial. Some request for regional WT/COMTD/M/25 Page 32 seminars had already been refused: one was on trade and development for middle-eastern countries, in Malta; one was for-English speaking LDCs on rules, in Malawi; and so forth.","WTCOMTDM25.pdf","Director, Technical, Cooperation, Division, United, Kingdom, WTO, WTO, WTO, WTO, TBT, SPS, Singapore, Seattle, Ministerial, Malta, Malawi"
"1955",1955,"124","124.     The Director of the Technical Cooperation Division said that the current problem lay in the fact that because it was not known in advance what funds would be available for a particular year, the approach that was followed was one of first-come, first-served, though efforts were made, to the extent that was possible, to consolidate requests into regional seminars. Ad hoc requests received amounted to 57, at a cost of CHF947,000. TPR reviews accounted for CHF500,000. Additional funding was for TPR reviews of least-developed countries, notably Chad, Mozambique and Mauritania, as well as Malawi, Central African Republic and Madagascar. Regarding short term trade policy courses, the task force report on enhanced technical cooperation called for eight short-term trade policy courses. The estimate in the budget provided for four at CHF150,000 apiece. The final result of the technical assistance budget for 1999 was a projected deficit of CHF2.6 million. He indicated his intention to call an informal meeting with donors to evaluate the current situation, and to see whether a positive response could be elicited to this situation.","WTCOMTDM25.pdf","Director, Technical, Cooperation, Division, TPR, TPR, Chad, Mozambique, Mauritania, Malawi, Central, African, Republic, Madagascar"
"1956",1956,"125","125.     The Director of the Technical Cooperation Division said that the future orientation of technical cooperation could be dealt with under three sub-headings. First, the question of funding OF activities. As indicated previously, 90 per cent of current financial requirements were met through extra-budgetary resources, making it extremely difficult for the WTO to efficiently plan technical cooperation activities. The regular WTO budget for technical cooperation needed urgently to be revisited, if technical cooperation was to continue. Second, it was necessary to identify possibilities for outsourcing. In this context the task force on enhanced WTO technical cooperation circulated recently to Members identified possibilities. Areas where WTO expertise could be supplemented included intellectual property rights (WIPO), customs matters (WCO), TBT (ISO), SPS (Codex), preparations for post-Seattle negotiations (the World Bank); trade and investment and trade and competition (UNCTAD), training information technology (ITC). The paper also identified a number of organisations at the regional level, including UN regional commissions, the Joint Vienna Institute, with which memoranda of understanding could be negotiated. Finally, the elaboration of multi-year programmes of interest to developing countries would permit a more structured approach to technical assistance, but was dependent on a strengthened regular budget. What could be anticipated as priorities were overview of WTO agreements, followed by an upgrading of human capacity to enable better participation in the WTO, and finally specialised knowledge to enable the implementation of WTO agreements.","WTCOMTDM25.pdf","Director, Technical, Cooperation, Division, WTO, WTO, WTO, Members, WTO, WIPO, WCO, TBT, Codex, World, Bank, UNCTAD, ITC, UN, Joint, Vienna, Institute, WTO, WTO, WTO"

The representative of Morocco thanked the Director of the Technical Cooperation Division for his presentation, which filled in some of the gaps left in the written report. His delegation were pleased to note the increase, by about a third, in activities from 1997 to 1998, and wished to see this trend continue. His delegation reiterated the importance it accorded to the technical cooperation activities of the WTO, which should accompany in an effective way all the activities of the organisation, and which should keep pace with the evolution of the multilateral trading system. His delegation reiterated the importance it accorded to the Integrated Framework for trade-related technical assistance, and noted with regret delays in its implementation, particularly with respect to the convening of round table meetings. Without such meetings, decisions taken at the High-Level Meeting would remain ineffectual. He also reiterated the importance of the JITAP process, and said that it should be extended to other African countries.

The representative of Morocco said that there were certain analytical aspects missing from the written report. notably regarding the budget and the distribution of expenditure. The approach that had been adopted on the basis of the number of activities provided an approximate indication of the value of the activity, but a budgetary breakdown would provide a clear indication of the value of activities, as well as an indication of the distribution of resources, thus enabling an identification of priorities, on a thematic basis. The next report should have a section dealing with coordination and cooperation with other competent agencies. The approach adopted in the report reflected in a fragmented fashion the question of cooperation and coordination. A more integrated section would provide a clearer indication of the approach followed by the Secretariat in the sphere of coordination and cooperation with other agencies.","WTCOMTDM25.pdf","Morocco, Secretariat"

The representative of Morocco said he would not comment on the evaluation of technical cooperation given that his delegation had made known its views on a number of prior occasions. Addressing the issue of financing, he said that his delegation was very concerned about the financial crisis that affected technical cooperation activities. He noted that the fraction of costs covered by the regular WTO budget had been 20 per cent and 1998 and was projected at 10 per cent for 1999. His delegation supported the recommendations of the Task Force on Technical Cooperation that the funding of technical cooperation from the regular budget be increased. He said that there should be increased predictability of funding from extra-budgetary sources, as both a gesture of solidarity and a commitment on the part of the organisation as a whole.","WTCOMTDM25.pdf","Morocco, WTO"

The representative of the European Communities thanked the Director of the Technical Cooperation Division for his presentation, and said he agreed with most of what had been said by the representative of Morocco. He made the following suggestions concerning the report: first, it would be useful if the budget section of the report was clearer, for instance by indicating who paid for what. This would increase transparency and may be an incentive for others to pay for more. Second, the forward-looking section was important to encourage discussion of future activities, and this section should be expanded accordingly. He said that the Task Force had more importance for future activities than was reflected in the report. There was also a strong link to the ongoing debate about coherence. He urged that this subject be dealt with in a comprehensive manner, particularly in regard to cooperation with other organisations. He noted the possibility of cooperation with other organisations that would be able to fund activities undertaken. He also suggested that it would be useful if points raised in the presentation made to the CTD could be made to the Budget Committee in order to raise awareness.","WTCOMTDM25.pdf","European, Communities, Director, Technical, Cooperation, Division, Morocco, CTD, Budget, Committee"
"1963",1963,"131","131.    The representative of Egypt thanked the Director of the Technical Cooperation Division for his presentation, and said he shared the views expressed by the delegations of Morocco and the European Communities regarding several issues. He said that when technical assistance had been reviewed in 1997, his delegation had indicated that there had been five positive elements regarding technical assistance activities in 1997. These had been: the increase in the level of technical assistance activities; increase in the level of extra-budgetary resources; increase in Africa's share of technical assistance; increased coverage of WTO agreements; and increase in activities in relation to the High-Level Meeting. A number of these observations were still valid, and his delegation welcomed the continuation of those trends. With regard to the report submitted to the CTD, he said there were again five positive elements. These were: the slight increase in budgetary outlay for technical assistance; the increase in technical missions; the use of information technologies – particularly the increased availability of training packages through the Internet; the JITAP process; and the fast pace of implementation of technical assistance activities.","WTCOMTDM25.pdf","Egypt, Director, Technical, Cooperation, Division, Morocco, Africa, WTO, CTD"
"1964",1964,"132","132.     The representative of Egypt said that his delegation had two serious concerns. The first, as pointed out by the Director of the Technical Cooperation Division himself was the small and falling percentage of technical cooperation activities funded through the regular budget. The second concern related to the projected shortfall in financing, and he indicated that his delegation would participate in WT/COMTD/M/25 Page 34 the informal consultations held by the Director of the Technical Cooperation Division in this regard. Egypt was also concerned with the capacity of the Secretariat to deliver technical assistance. His delegation had several ideas on the matter, in relation to strengthening the Technical Cooperation Division, strengthening other Secretariat divisions responsible for the delivery of technical assistance, and addressing issues of finance and relations with other international organisations. He concluded with the following questions: first, his delegation would like a breakdown of the budget, as requested by the delegations of Morocco and the European Communities, adding that the breakdown should go back to the establishment of the WTO, in order to obtain a comparative view of developments since the establishment of the WTO to the present. This would facilitate a discussion of financial issues in the context of informal consultations. Second, page 24 of the report refered to the evaluation of technical assistance in the first quarter of the year 2000. His delegation hoped that an assessment of JITAP could take place at the same time. The third request related to the translation of basic WTO documents into Arabic. His delegation had been informed at a previous meeting by Mr. Hoda that consultations on this subject would be necessary, and the representative of Egypt requested that the Secretariat get back to his delegation regarding that point. In addition to these question, the representative of Egypt noted that, in relation to JITAP, page 32 refered to a table on budget outlays. However, this table did not appear in the document, and he requested that it be issued. With regard to page 14, which referred to conditions attached to funds provided by donors, he recalled that his delegation had previously requested information on donor conditionality, and awaited a response. Finally, the issue of outsourcing needed to be addressed, and particularly what was required on allowing the WTO to undertake outsourcing when capacity shortfalls did not allow the delivery of technical assistance.","WTCOMTDM25.pdf","Egypt, Director, Technical, Cooperation, Division, Director, Technical, Cooperation, Division, Egypt, Secretariat, Technical, Cooperation, Division, Secretariat, Morocco, WTO, WTO, JITAP, WTO, Hoda, Egypt, Secretariat, Egypt, WTO"
"1965",1965,"133","133.     The representative of Norway thanked the Director of the Technical Cooperation Division for his presentation, and began by observing that in 1998, the WTO spent CHF7 million in technical assistance, and that this figure would increase to 9.4 million in 1999. This was a small amount of money. He said the way technical assistance had been financed in the past years had been less than satisfactory. The growth in technical assistance in recent years had been made possible by extra-budgetary funding by a small group of countries. Technical assistance was a right enjoyed by developing Members, and therefore a core activity of the WTO, and should therefore be financed through the regular budget. All Members needed to take this collective responsibility. He noted that some delegations had said that the continuous increase in technical assistance activities posed a threat to the organisation, that the WTO should not be a technical assistance organisation, and that the Secretariat should not devote an excessive amount of time to technical assistance. He said his delegation understood these concerns, and added that these should be addressed by outsourcing to other international organisations most or all technical assistance activities which did not have to be conducted by WTO staff. He recognised that there were some activities that had to be conducted by WTO. He said that the CTD had approved such an outsourcing process in its meeting in November 1998, and the Secretariat had prepared a note on its plans for outsourcing through the Task Force on Enhanced Technical Cooperation. The crux of the problem, however, lay in the fact that one could not expect other international organisations to undertake technical cooperation activities for the WTO without receiving payment. Therefore, even if as much outsourcing was done as possible, some action was needed in regard to financing. As pointed out by the Director of the Technical Cooperation Division, the Secretariat would be unable to finance technical cooperation activities as of the autumn of 1999 owing to lack of funds. The representative of Norway said that furthermore, funding from extra-budgetary sources was not a long term solution. It was a paradox that the WTO, which was in the process of preparing a new round, had to struggle with such a trivial issue. All that needed to be done was to augment the regular budget so as to fund technical assistance activities in the same manner as other activities of the Secretariat. A solution should be found by the time of the Seattle Ministerial Conference, and once a solution was found, extra-budgetary funding could be phased out. In conclusion, the representative of Norway said that the concerns of those not wishing to make the WTO a technical cooperation organisation could be addressed. This left the issue of financing, which could be resolved by increasing the regular budget. Finally, he said that the informal                                                                                    WT/COMTD/M/25                                                                                           Page 35 consultations the Director of the Technical Cooperation Division was to hold should be open to all, and not just donors, as the financing of technical cooperation was a collective responsibility.","WTCOMTDM25.pdf","Norway, Director, Technical, Cooperation, Division, WTO, Members, WTO, Members, WTO, Secretariat, WTO, WTO, CTD, Secretariat, Task, Force, on, Enhanced, Technical, Cooperation, WTO, Director, Technical, Cooperation, Division, Secretariat, Norway, WTO, Secretariat, Seattle, Ministerial, Conference, Norway, WTO, Director, Technical, Cooperation, Division"

He said his delegation had been rather taken by surprise by the gloomy budgetary situation, and added that the report should have a forward-looking chapter. Second, his delegation believed that the section on evaluation of technical assessment needed to be more concrete and provide some indicators on qualitative aspects. His delegation looked forward to with great interest to the evaluation report which was due in early in 2000. Only then would one be in a position to draw conclusions about the future orientation of the Technical cooperation Division.","WTCOMTDM25.pdf","Switzerland, Secretariat, Technical, Cooperation, Division"
"1967",1967,"135","135.     The representative of Barbados thanked the Director of the Technical Cooperation Division for his presentation. She said she had understood from the presentation that owing to the demands for technical assistance in connections with negotiations launched at the Seattle Ministerial, the number of missions to capitals in the year 2000 was likely to be reduced. For countries such as hers with small economies, technical cooperation needs were liable to increase exponentially with the commencement of negotiations, especially if negotiations covered issues other than those of the ""built-in agenda"". It was therefore necessary to find some very creative solutions to in order to provide increased technical cooperation activities. The outsourcing of technical cooperation activities was one such possible solution.","WTCOMTDM25.pdf","Barbados, Director, Technical, Cooperation, Division, Seattle, Ministerial"
"1968",1968,"136","136.    The representative of Senegal thanked the Secretariat for its work in the area of technical assistance as well as donors for their contributions. He said that many organisations were involved in technical cooperation and that this could enable the WTO to rationalise and focus its technical assistance. He said noted that some agreements were more specialised than others, and suggested the exploration of training programmes for trainers.","WTCOMTDM25.pdf","Senegal, Secretariat, WTO"

The representative of Hong Kong, China thanked the Director of the Technical Cooperation Division, and echoed the concerns raised by others on the predominance of extra-budgetary sources of funding for technical cooperation activities. The present situation was most unsatisfactory, and action should be taken forthwith. Her delegation welcomed bringing the issue to the attention of the Budget and Finance Committee.","WTCOMTDM25.pdf","Hong, Kong, China, Director, Technical, Cooperation, Division, Budget, and, Finance, Committee"
"1970",1970,"138","138.    The Director of the Technical Cooperation Division responded to questions raised by delegations. In response to the question by the representative for Korea, he said that the rate for Europe reflected technical assistance activities held in at the WTO Headquarters. If these activities were excluded, it could be seen that a greater number of activities were held in the Asia/Pacific than in Europe. Regarding the question raised by the representative of Egypt regarding Memoranda of Understanding with donors, he said that he did have information on the basis of responses from the 10 donors contacted in writing. Seven of these donors indicated their willingness to share information, while three others indicated their willingness to issue a background paper regarding their Memoranda of Understanding. Regarding the issue of outsourcing, he said that some activities had already been outsourced. Memoranda of Understanding were being finalised with Institute for Latin American and Caribbean Integration, the training arm of the Inter-American Development Bank, and ESCAP. A large regional seminar was to be handled by the Joint Vienna Institute at the end of June, who were also prepared to handle accommodation, transport, visas, medical insurance and other administrative concerns. Similar arrangements were being negotiated with ESCAP. Efforts were being made to coordinate the holding of short term trade policy courses, and the outsourcing of these courses. was envisioned for the future. Some types of activities, such as those requiring specialist knowledge, could probably never be outsourced, short of implementing the proposal made by the representative of Senegal for training trainers. He agreed with the representative of Norway that informal consultations should be open to all. Regarding the comments by the representative of WT/COMTD/M/25 Page 36 Switzerland that his delegation would have liked some advance indication of the budgetary situation, Mr. Léger said that a document had been circulated to the Budget Committee on 25 March 1999, indicating the situation facing the financing of technical cooperation activities. At the time, a deficit of 2 million had been projected, as compared to the current projection of 2.6 million. He would speak to the Director of the Finance and General Services Division, to examine the possibility of presenting to the Budget Committee the budgetary preoccupations surrounding technical cooperation activities. In connection with the statement made by the representative of Barbados, he said that the launch of new negotiations would mean that most of the Secretariat would be involved with the servicing of committees and working groups, the writing of papers, and so forth, thus limiting the amount of time they could devote to conducting seminars and other such activities on the field. He said that the demand for technical cooperation activities was likely to increase, while supply was likely to decrease, which made the gap even larger than at present. He did not have a solution, as yet, to this problem. The Director of the Technical Cooperation Division thanked all delegations for their comments, adding that in its next report the Secretariat would endeavour to include more details on financing as well as some paragraphs on qualitative indicators.","WTCOMTDM25.pdf","Director, Technical, Cooperation, Division, Korea, Europe, WTO, Headquarters, Europe, Egypt, Institute, for, Latin, American, and, Caribbean, Integration, Inter-American, Development, Bank, ESCAP, Joint, Vienna, Institute, ESCAP, Senegal, Norway, Switzerland, Léger, Budget, Committee, Director, Finance, General, Services, Division, Budget, Committee, Barbados, Secretariat, Director, Technical, Cooperation, Division, Secretariat"

She said that technical cooperation was essential to the integration of developing countries into the multilateral trading system. She said that it was her impression that the views of the CTD regarding the financial crisis and the need for extra technical assistance activities should be presented to the Budget Committee. If Members agreed, she would send a letter to the chairman of the Budget Committee.","WTCOMTDM25.pdf","Chairperson, Members, Director, Technical, Cooperation, Division, CTD, Budget, Committee, Members, chairman, Budget, Committee"
"1972",1972,"14","14.      The Deputy Secretary-General of the Economic Cooperation Organisation (ECO), said it was the first time that his organisation was attending a meeting of the WTO. ECO comprised ten countries of West and Central Asia, of which six were economies in transition. It was mandated by its basic charter to pursue objectives leading to the removal of trade barriers between member states and the smooth integration of its members into the global economy. Presently, three of the ECO states – Pakistan, Turkey and the Kyrgyz Republic – were full members of the WTO. Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan and Iran had applied for WTO membership, while Tadjikistan and Turkmenistan were considering applications. Although moves towards trade liberalisation occurred at a slow pace and intra-regional trade remained modest at 7 per cent, the organisation was directing its members towards free trade and the acceptance of multilateral rules and disciplines. He said the status of Observer to the CTD, and hopefully later to the General Council, placed ECO in the mainstream of multilateral decision-making on trade, and would help ECO provide more input into intergovernmental deliberations and decisions of its members, which would in turn provide for more feedback and action by member states. It was on this understanding that the second WTO Seminar for the ECO region held in Antalya, in Turkey, envisaged a more concrete role for ECO in the provision of assistance to allow members to better accommodate trade rules whilst pursuing development objectives through trade expansion. A third joint WTO-ECO event is on the agenda of the ECO. He said that ECO believed that the Secretariats of the ECO and the WTO should cooperate closely to formulate proper ways to dismantle trade barriers and expand trade within the region. Finally, he thanked the chairperson and all Members of the CTD for inviting ECO to attend the 25th Session of the CTD.","WTCOMTDM25.pdf","Economic, Cooperation, Organisation, WTO, ECO, Central, Asia, ECO, Pakistan, Turkey, Kyrgyz, Republic, WTO, Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Iran, WTO, Tadjikistan, Turkmenistan, CTD, General, Council, ECO, ECO, Antalya, Turkey, ECO, ECO, ECO, WTO, Members, CTD, ECO, CTD"

"1975",1975,"142","142.     The Chairperson proposed that before discussed the two remaining items, she wished to recall the importance that Members attached to the issues raised by Mr. Jean-Maurice Léger, Director, Technical Cooperation Division, at the CTD Meeting of 4 June, in the presentation of the Report on Technical Cooperation and Training in 1998, which focussed, inter alia, on the financial crisis confronting the delivery of WTO technical assistance. Following the exchange of views by members, it was agreed that the Chairperson should address a letter to the Chairperson of the Committee on Budget, Finance and Administration.

Following that exchange, it had been agreed to revert to this item at the 25th Sessions, and that the Secretariat should prepare an informal note that summarised the informal consultations and that framed the discussions of the CTD on the item for the present meeting. The Secretariat had done so in its Informal Note contained in Job No. 2940, which was circulated to Members on 21 May 1999. The Chairperson hoped that Members had had the chance to consider the Informal Note by the Secretariat. She invited Members to comment on the Informal Note by the Secretariat, to exchange views on the item, and to offer suggestions on the procedure that the CTD should adopt in dealing with the item.","WTCOMTDM25.pdf","Chairperson, Members, Secretariat, CTD, Secretariat, Members, Chairperson, Members, Secretariat, Members, Secretariat, CTD"
"1979",1979,"146","146.     The representative of Egypt said that his delegation had been unable to attend the informal session, and thanked the Secretariat for the Informal Note summarising the positions taken by various delegations. His delegation felt that the direction taken by discussion was not the most appropriate. It appeared from the note that discussion had taken place on issues which were the sole responsibility of the General Council. Discussion on whether to have a Round or not, whether to adopt a single undertaking approach, discussion surrounding the modalities of negotiations, and so froth were the responsibility of the General Council. The CTD should focus on issues within its mandate to help developing countries in their preparation for the Ministerial Conference, and the mandated negotiations in various areas. His delegation proposed a number of areas in which the CTD could make a positive contribution to the Third Ministerial Conference. First, a preparation of a paper on the participation of developing countries in international trade. This paper had been prepared by the CTD on an annual basis, and the first year it had not been prepared was in 1998. The last paper produced had been WT/COMTD/W/31, in November 1997, and a constructive discussion had taken place in the CTD. A new version should consequently be produced, and should take into account the comments made by Members when the previous version had been discussed. Second, the CTD should address the issue of the distribution of benefits of the multilateral trading system on the basis of a Secretariat paper. He recalled that the Geneva Ministerial Declaration stated that Ministers agreed that more needed to be done to ensure that the worlds people shared more fully and equitably in the achievements of the multilateral trading system. Third, the Secretariat should begin analytical work on developing indicators to measure the integration of developing countries in the multilateral trading system. He noted that despite frequent references to the integration of developing countries into the multilateral trading system in meetings and in declaration, there was no clear idea of how this could be measured or evaluated. The fourth area concerned difficulties experienced by developing countries in the implementation of Uruguay Round Agreements. The Secretariat could contribute in this area by compiling difficulties experienced by developing countries, including in the area of market access for products of export interest to them. The issue of special and differential treatment had been discussed under a separate agenda item, and this was also an area where work could be undertaken. Another area of prime importance was that of technical assistance. The topic needed to be addressed to find ways and means of improving technical assistance in the WTO to address the difficulties, concerns and requirements of developing countries in regard to human and institutional capacity building. Another area was follow up to the High-Level Meeting on LDCs. The delegation of Egypt had proposed that the Secretariat prepare an analysis of market access offers made to LDCs in connections with the High Level Meeting, and examine the contribution of such offers to the trade of LDCs. Yet another area where analytical work may be required was that of credit for autonomous liberalisation. This was an important issue of which the development aspects could be usefully analysed by the CTD. Still another area of interest to developing countries was revenue implications of trade liberalisation. An analysis of this issue could be usefully addressed by the CTD. A final point, not covered in the Informal Note, was to have some relation between discussions taking place in the CTD and those taking place in the Committee on Trade and Environment. He concluded by WT/COMTD/M/25 Page 38 reiterating the view that Members should refrain from attempting to gain negotiating points in the CTD by addressing issues which were best left to the General Council.","WTCOMTDM25.pdf","Egypt, Secretariat, General, Council, General, Council, CTD, CTD, CTD, Members, CTD, Secretariat, Secretariat, Uruguay, Secretariat, WTO, Egypt, Secretariat, CTD, CTD, CTD, Committee, on, Trade, and, Environment, Members, CTD, General, Council"
"1980",1980,"147","147.     The representative of Morocco associated himself completely with the statement made by the representative of Egypt, and particularly regarding the fact that a number of questions discussed in the informal meeting and covered in the Informal Note were best left to the General Council. He said the CTD should focus instead on a substantive and technical contribution to the Third Ministerial Conference which would allow the latter to bring out concretely the concerns of developing countries. In this respect, the representative of Morocco supported entirely the list proposed by the delegation of Egypt. He said he wished to emphasis certain issues. First he said the CTD should adopt a proactive approach to implementation issues, and try to bring out the difficulties experienced by developing countries, and in addition evaluate globally implementation by developing countries and the impact of implementation on their economies. He noted that a number of evaluations were being conducted on a sectoral basis by other committees, and by country, in other international institutions. Regarding the issue of special and differential treatment, he recalled that his delegation had proposed the holding of a seminar. The CTD should contribute to the process of implementation of special and differential provision. There should be a should be a pragmatic and practical link between the seminar and the work of the CTD. The representative of Morocco said that the follow up to the High-Level Meeting on LDCs was crucial. He said that so far the implementation of decisions taken at the High-Level Meeting was proceeding at a very slow pace and that the CTD should send a strong signal to hasten the implementation of decisions taken in favour of LDCs. The last point he wished to take up was the subject of technical cooperation. It was not possible to conceive of the integration and participation of developing countries into the WTO and the multilateral trading system with only limited technical cooperation activities, which often did not meet up to the requirements of developing countries, especially with regard to enabling them to appropriate the benefits of the multilateral trading system. Technical cooperation was a fundamental element of the work conducted by the CTD, and the latter should make a significant contribution regarding technical cooperation at the Third Ministerial Conference.","WTCOMTDM25.pdf","Morocco, Egypt, General, Council, CTD, Morocco, Egypt, CTD, CTD, CTD, Morocco, CTD, WTO, CTD"
"1981",1981,"148","148.     The representative of the European Communities agreed that the CTD was not the place to discuss the scope and modalities of future negotiations, and questions of such a nature. He said it was legitimate for the CTD to flag issues where it could make a useful contribution. Referring to the Informal Note, which covered a variety of subjects such as a possible work programme for the CTD, he said that it was important to clarify that the discussion undertaken concerned the input to the Third Ministerial Conference. He said it was not immediately clear whether the lists of subjects presented by the representatives of Morocco and Egypt were related to possible inputs to the Third Ministerial Conference or the work programme of the CTD. If the former, the representative of the European Communities said that there was much to which his delegation could agree. Regarding implementation issues specifically, he cautioned that the CTD should not get involved in work done elsewhere in other committees, though he agreed with the representative of Morocco that there may be some cross cutting issues of a horizontal nature that needed to be addressed in the CTD. The representative of the European Communities recalled that the General Council, in keeping with paragraph 8 of the Ministerial Declaration, would discuss overall implementation issues, and the CTD could contribute to those discussions. He said that, in terms of making the whole process of developing CTD inputs into the Ministerial Conference operational, it would be useful as a first stage to collect ideas, and take these back to capitals for reflection. It would then be possible, at a later stage, to present to the General Council a menu of options. He said it was important that the CTD be given some sort of guidance from the General Council as to the direction of its work, especially regarding the more political issues. He concluded by saying he did not have, at that time, any specific reactions to individual proposals made, and reiterated that the purpose of the present meeting was not to comment on issues but to collect them.

"1982",1982,"149","149.     The representative of Mexico agreed with the delegations of Egypt and Morocco that it was necessary to clarify the issues to be handled in the future work of the CTD, and agreed that discussions regarding the scope, modalities, etc. of negotiations came under the mandate of the General Council. He said that it was necessary to clarify the issues which the CTD would address in preparing its input to the Third Ministerial Conference and also to establish a time-frame for the submission of its work to the General Council. He said it was important to avoid that the same work be carried out on two levels, within the CTD and the General Council. To this effect, he suggested that the CTD present its contribution regarding the Third Ministerial Conference to the General Council not later than 30 September, and leave it to the General Council to work thereafter on the issues proposed. Referring to the Informal Note, he said points 1 and 2 dealt with negotiation issues, while Point 3 and thereafter dealt with the work programme of the CTD. He said the CTD already had a work programme, and discussions had been held already on a number of points mentioned in the Informal Note. While the issue of coherence between institutions and policies had not been discussed in the CTD, the General Council had conducted an analysis of the question. The role of the CTD with regard to coherence would be to stress its development aspects. Finally, with regard to the list presented by the representative of Egypt, he said that in addition to the points raised therein his delegation would also like to see discussed development aspects as well as the subject of revenues. He also noted that work was being conducted on a number of points listed by the representative of Egypt. In conclusion, he said that it needed to be established whether the CTD was to follow its work programme with a view to making an input to the Seattle Ministerial Conference by means of a contribution to the General Council by 30 September, or whether the CTD would follow its work programme and present its results in December. He said the former was the better option if the CTD was to make an input to the preparatory process.","WTCOMTDM25.pdf","Mexico, Egypt, Morocco, CTD, General, Council, CTD, General, Council, CTD, General, Council, General, Council, General, Council, CTD, CTD, CTD, General, Council, CTD, Egypt, Egypt, CTD, Seattle, General, Council, CTD, CTD"
"1983",1983,"15","15.      The representative of Korea congratulated the organisations granted ad hoc observer status on a meeting by meeting basis. His delegation wished to make two comments. Considering the difficulties faced in granting observer status to applicants, he said that the case-by case procedure taken should be used in future. This approach was clearly referenced in General Council guidelines formulated several years before. Second, considering the difficulties faced, his delegation was of the view that the guidelines and criteria used for granting observer status should be revised. His delegation understood that the delegation of the United States had circulated proposals in the General Council for revision of these guidelines. He therefore hoped that on the basis of these and other proposals, the matter would be discussed in the General Council.","WTCOMTDM25.pdf","Korea, General, Council, United, States, General, Council, General, Council"
"1984",1984,"150","150.     The representative of Australia supported wholeheartedly the comments made by the representative of Egypt, and others, regarding the issues of process and modalities. She said there was considerable scope for constructive work within the CTD in preparation for the Seattle Ministerial, particularly in identifying in a concrete way some of the specific problems and concerns of developing countries. She supported the proposal made by the representative of Egypt that the study on the participation of developing countries in international trade be updated. Her delegation believed that areas in which the CTD could make a specific input into the preparatory process included the specific challenges faced by developing countries in improving participation in world trade; responses by WTO Members to these challenges; market access issues relating to products of export interest to developing countries; and the enhancement of technical assistance for capacity building. Her delegation was also of the view that the implementation of special and differential treatment could appropriately be dealt with by the CTD, though it was important to bear in mind work undertaken in the General Council. The survey on the implementation of special and differential provisions that was being carried out by the CTD was very useful in this context. Finally, her delegation wished to flag a few issues: first, follow up to the High-Level Meeting on LDCs was of utmost importance, and she noted that follow up involved an extensive work programme that went beyond the single question of market access; regarding implementation, caution was needed to avoid involvement in the work of other committees, though there could be issues of a horizontal nature that could be addressed; regarding credit for autonomous liberalisation, it remained unclear as to discussions held under the mandate of the General Council; with regard to customs revenue studies, she drew attention to the study prepared by Australia regarding the benefits of future liberalisation, which noted particularly the proportionate gains to developing countries from further liberalisation; and finally, the CTD could play a useful role in drawing attention to work conducted elsewhere such as in the World Bank or UNCTAD.","WTCOMTDM25.pdf","Australia, Egypt, CTD, Seattle, Ministerial, Egypt, CTD, WTO, Members, CTD, General, Council, CTD, General, Council, Australia, CTD, World, Bank, UNCTAD"
"1985",1985,"151","151.     The representative of Canada thanked the Secretariat for the Informal Note, and said the CTD had a constructive role to play in the preparatory process for the Third Ministerial Conference, while at the same time avoiding covering issues that fell within the mandate of the General Council. The work of the CTD should be pragmatic and advisory, to assist delegations in their search for WT/COMTD/M/25 Page 40 development friendly options. The work programme of the CTD should be based on its capacity to deliver specific advice to the General Council, and thence to the Ministerial Conference, in a manner reminiscent of its work on the Action Plan for LDCs and guidelines for WTO technical cooperation prior to the Singapore Ministerial Conference. Turning to the Informal Note, she said that the proposal to strengthen Part IV of the GATT regarding market access for manufactures and primary products of developing countries, as wells as stable and remunerative prices, needed to be examined as each agreement was negotiated in turn. She said the issue of coherence was being addressed in other fora, and notably the informal sessions of the General Council. She noted the reference in the Informal Note to a joint meeting between the WTO and the World Bank on the results of the World Bank project on supporting the participation of developing countries in the future trade negotiations. While the CTD should monitor discussions, it should not seek to take the lead on coherence issues. She said that the CTD had done much work on implementation, trade-related technical assistance and special and differential treatment. She invited the CTD to look again at these issues with a view to preparing proposals for submission to the Third Ministerial Conference. Some consideration needed to be given to the two revised papers on implementation issues, namely WT/COMTD/LDC/W10 and WT/COMTD/LDC/W/11/Rev.1. She said the CTD should adjust its work programme in order to have a CTD review, including representatives from UNCTAD, of special and differential treatment. Some of the recommendations arising from the review could then be tabled to the General Council, and thence to the Ministerial Conference. The review would cover concerns regarding market access issues and the implementation of Uruguay Round outcomes. She said a review should be undertaken of implementation issues with specific recommendations on trade-related technical assistance to be forwarded to the General Council, and thence to the Ministerial Conference. The discussion could cover the implementation of the Integrated Framework for Trade- related Technical Assistance. She said the CTD could undertake a more ambitious work programme, and could be mandated to provide advise to delegations on each agreement as it was negotiated. She said that the proposal for joint meetings between the Committee on Trade and Environment and the CTD was useful, but invited delegations to comment as the whether this was the best use of the CTD's time given the pressing need to clarify options for developing countries. The preference of her delegation was that the CTD retain a narrower focus on the emerging trade negotiations and options for developing countries.","WTCOMTDM25.pdf","Canada, Secretariat, CTD, General, Council, CTD, CTD, General, Council, LDCs, WTO, GATT, General, Council, WTO, World, Bank, World, Bank, CTD, CTD, CTD, CTD, CTD, UNCTAD, General, Council, Uruguay, General, Council, Integrated, Framework, for, Trade, CTD, Committee, on, Trade, and, Environment, CTD, CTD"
"1986",1986,"152","152.    The representative of Switzerland said that the most important role of the CTD was to raise awareness of development issues on a horizontal basis. The goal of his delegation would be to provide the General Council with a broad overview of problems developing countries were facing. An alternative goal would be to provide a concrete input into the Seattle Ministerial Declaration. He said the first option was certainly valuable, though its use as an input into the Seattle Ministerial Conference was less clear. He said the proposals made, respectively, by the delegations of Egypt and Morocco, tended in the direction of a broad overview through the preparation of background documents. This would be valuable at a later stage once negotiations had begun. The present focus of the CTD was, however, to prepare and input into the Seattle Ministerial Declaration. Lengthy texts were not required, but rather concise statements to the General Council which would then be responsible for the drafting of recommendations to Ministers.","WTCOMTDM25.pdf","Switzerland, CTD, General, Council, Seattle, Seattle, Ministerial, Conference, Egypt, Morocco, CTD, Seattle, General, Council"
"1987",1987,"153","153.     The representative of the Republic of Korea said that many delegations had enumerated areas where useful work could be done. His delegation, however, was of the view that given time constraints, the CTD had to be more focused on issues concerned directly with the launch of new negotiations. He noted that some of the issues raised by the Egyptian delegation were connected to work in the General Council, and that therefore discussions needed to be held with members of the General Council. His delegation asked whether there was a distinction between the work programme of the CTD and the input of the CTD to the Third Ministerial Conference, and referred to the Informal Note, which seemed to indicate that there was some overlap between the two processes. He suggested that if indeed there was no clear distinction between the two, that the Secretariat reorganise the                                                                                     WT/COMTD/M/25                                                                                            Page 41 Informal Note in order to enable the CTD to decide which issues were more relevant as inputs to the Seattle Ministerial Conference.","WTCOMTDM25.pdf","Republic, of, Korea, CTD, General, Council, General, Council, CTD, CTD, Secretariat, CTD, Seattle, Ministerial, Conference"
"1988",1988,"154","154.    The representative of Pakistan thanked the Secretariat for the Informal Note, and said his delegation associated itself extensively with the statement made by the representative of Egypt, and also that made by Morocco. Discussions regarding scope, modalities and so forth of future trade negotiations were the to be left to the General Council, and their discussion in the CTD would detract from work on developmental issues. His delegation were of the view that the list of issues identified by Egypt, and augmented by Morocco, should formulate the basis of any further work of the CTD, including in the preparation of inputs to the Third Ministerial Conference.","WTCOMTDM25.pdf","Pakistan, Secretariat, Egypt, Morocco, General, Council, CTD, Egypt, Morocco, CTD"
"1989",1989,"155","155.    The representative of India noted that there some points on which there was an emerging consensus, one of them being that issues regarding to scope, modalities and so forth of future trade negotiations should not be addressed in the CTD. Second, the point had been made that the CTD should make its contribution to the General Council. Third, the need to update the paper on the participation of developing countries in international trade had been stressed. His delegation fully associated itself with those who had made statements in support of these points. Regarding the way forward, he said that there appeared to be two distinct rubrics on which the CTD should focus. The first was some input to the General Council in view of the Seattle Ministerial Conference, and the second was the future work programme of the CTD. His delegation were of the view that it would be useful if the CTD were to focus on three issues prior to Seattle, namely difficulties faced by developing countries in the implementation of Uruguay Round Agreements, special and differential treatment, and technical assistance. These three issues should form the basis of the CTD's work programme prior to the Seattle Ministerial Conference. He said the proposal made by Japan to consider one issue at a time and how to move forward on them, was a useful one. A starting-point was to see whether there was work that had already been done by the CTD that could be built upon. The issue of revenue implications of trade liberalisation was one on which work had not been previously but which was nevertheless of importance. He said that questions relating to the form of the contribution made by the CTD to the General Council could be addressed later, and that the present priority was to focus on specific issues.","WTCOMTDM25.pdf","India, CTD, CTD, General, Council, CTD, General, Council, Seattle, Ministerial, Conference, CTD, CTD, Seattle, Uruguay, CTD, Seattle, Ministerial, Conference, Japan, CTD, CTD, General, Council"
"1990",1990,"156","156.     The representative of the United States said her delegation agreed that some of the issues listed in the Informal Note were better left to the General Council and that the focus of the CTDs work should be on positive, practical contributions to the General Council. Her delegation were of the view that the list proposed by the delegation of Egypt was a useful starting point in order to develop an input of a practical and advisory nature to the General Council. Turning to specific issues, she said that her delegation did not necessarily share the views expressed by the Indian delegation regarding the deletion of certain words in particular special and differential provisions. With regard to small and vulnerable economies, her delegation did not believe that any measure should be taken that would appear to create a different category of Members, but rather that the concerns of small and vulnerable economies be addressed through existing provisions for special and differential treatment. Her delegation agreed completely with the intervention by Mexico on how to proceed, and notably that points 1 and 2 of the Informal Note were not directly relevant to the preparation of possible inputs to the General Council. She added that her delegation did not necessarily agree with all the statements presented in the Informal Note, or the assumptions that underpinned the. Her delegation was not of the view, for instance, that there was any inherent conflict between the TRIPS Agreement and the Convention on Biodiversity. In conclusion, her delegation welcomed the further investigation of proposals made by Egypt, Morocco, Canada, Mexico, the European Communities, and others, in order to develop recommendations to the General Council regarding the Third Ministerial Conference.","WTCOMTDM25.pdf","United, States, General, Council, General, Council, Egypt, General, Council, Members, Mexico, General, Council, Egypt, Morocco, Canada, Mexico, European, Communities, General, Council"
"1991",1991,"157","157.      The representative of Argentina said his delegation wished to associate itself with the consensus that questions relating to the scope, modalities and so forth of future trade negotiations be left to the General Council. His delegation did not as yet have specific instructions on how to proceed WT/COMTD/M/25 Page 42 regarding the preparatory process for the Seattle Ministerial Conference. It was not yet clear that the CTD needed to make a specific contribution at all to the General Council. He said that the preparatory process for the Seattle Ministerial Conference was driven by proposals made by Members, rather than on the basis of proposals by specific committees or councils. If indeed the CTD were to discuss a possible contribution to the General Council, he said it was very good to bear in mind the proposal made by Switzerland that one distinguish between the preparation of background documents, and the discussion of implementation problems faced developing countries, as this would facilitate the making of decisions with regard to a possible input into the preparatory process. His delegation wished to support the issues brought forward by the delegation of Egypt and Morocco, and particularly the proposal to update the document on the participation of developing countries in international trade. His delegation was also of the view that some work could be conducted on the distribution of benefits of the multilateral trading system, along with the question of the integration of developing countries into the multilateral trading system. The CTD could also discuss difficulties in the implementation of the Uruguay Round Agreements, along with the subjects of trade-related technical assistance and the follow up to the High-Level Meeting on LDCs. The CTD should take into account the work of the World Bank and UNCTAD on the subject of implementation to avoid the duplication of work. He said that his delegation was a small one, and would not like issues that were discussed in one particular forum to be discussed in a number of other fora. He cited as an example the issue of credit for autonomous liberalisation which was being discussed elsewhere than the CTD. Regarding the work programme of the CTD, he was favourable to the idea of proceeding point by point.","WTCOMTDM25.pdf","Argentina, General, Council, Seattle, Ministerial, Conference, CTD, General, Council, Seattle, Ministerial, Conference, Members, CTD, General, Council, Switzerland, Egypt, Morocco, CTD, Uruguay, CTD, World, Bank, UNCTAD, CTD, CTD"
"1992",1992,"158","158.     The representative of Japan said that his capital was still scrutinising the detail of the Informal Note. He said that the Secretariat Note was a good basis for discussion, and covered a wide range of issues discussed at the informal session. Further work needed to be conducted on the document, possibly involving a reduction in the number of topics covered in order to keep within the mandate of the CTD. Regarding questions of procedure, he said that a substantive issue was taking place on paragraph 9, which dealt with. inter alia, implementation issues and follow up to the High-Level Meeting on LDCs. Similarly, there had been an informal General Council session on the question of credit for autonomous liberalisation. The question consisted therefore of how to integrate the CTD's input into discussions in the General Council, and how to avoid conflict with the work of the General Council. He noted that as of autumn, the General Council would enter the phase of drafting the Seattle Ministerial Declaration, and recalled the suggestion made by Mexico that a two-track approach be avoided and that the CTDs contribution be made by 30 September 1999. Care was needed, therefore, in dealing with questions relating to procedures followed by the CTD as it sought to prepare a contribution to the General Council.","WTCOMTDM25.pdf","Japan, Secretariat, CTD, CTD, General, Council, General, Council, General, Council, Seattle, Mexico, CTD, General, Council"
"1993",1993,"159","159.     The representative of Senegal thanked the Secretariat for the Informal Note. His delegation associated itself with the remarks made by the representative of Egypt to the effect that the CTD should focus on issues within its mandate. The representative of Senegal addressed the issue of technical cooperation, and said that it was incumbent on Members to ensure that technical cooperation activities were relevant, visible, and had a concrete impact on beneficiary Members. Ways needed to be explored to ensure that the Seattle Ministerial conference reaffirmed the importance of technical cooperation as a fundamental means of achieving the goals of the WTO, and the integration of developing countries into the global economy through international trade. Such a reaffirmation at the highest level of the value of technical cooperation would serve as a political support for the future directions taken by technical cooperation activities. Another issue of importance was the integration of LDCs into the multilateral trading system. The excessive dependence of LDCs on the export of a few primary commodities to a few markets, combined with asymmetries between their export revenue and expenditures on imports, was widely recognised as contributing to the fragility of their economies. The deterioration of terms of trade, and the burden of debt, were two factors which impeded the growth of LDCs, and developing countries in general. It was therefore necessary that commitments Members had undertaken in relation to LDCs be honoured, and that new and ambitious                                                                                      WT/COMTD/M/25                                                                                             Page 43 initiatives be adopted in favour of LDCs. He referred in this respect to a proposal made by the delegation of Bangladesh to the General Council, and indicated that his delegation would consult with the delegation of Bangladesh as how best to take up the proposal in the CTD. Referring to the question of regional and sub-regional arrangements, he said that the interpenetration of economic areas was indispensable for counties like his which suffered from the fragmentation of markets and lack of scale. He said this was a priority issue for his delegation, and said that the Seattle Ministerial Conference should be the occasion to reaffirm the importance of such arrangements, and not an occasion to throw into question what had already been established regarding this topic.","WTCOMTDM25.pdf","Senegal, Secretariat, Egypt, CTD, Senegal, Members, Members, Seattle, Ministerial, WTO, Members, Bangladesh, General, Council, Bangladesh, CTD, Seattle, Ministerial, Conference"
"1994",1994,"16","16.      The representative of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) thanked the Director-General of the WTO for the recognition given to ECOWAS through the granting of ad hoc observer status to meetings of the CTD. He said ECOWAS was often viewed as an organisation the function of which was peace-keeping and conflict resolution, as evidenced in Liberia and Sierra Leone. It was the view of ECOWAS that there could be no free movement of persons and goods, no commercial trading, no economic growth or development, without peace. However, far from being an organisation exclusively devoted to the conflict resolution and peacekeeping, ECOWAS was first and foremost an economic community of 16 West African states, whose objectives were to promote economic cooperation and integration within the context of an economic union for West Africa, with the purpose of raising the standards of living of its people, of maintaining and increasing economic stability, strengthening relations between members states, and contributing to development on the African continent. To achieve these objectives, the Community sought to create a common market through trade liberalisation amongst Members. It sought to establish a common external tariff and a common trade policy amongst members. The removal of obstacles to the free circulation of good, persons, services and capital, along with rights to residence and establishment were integral to the concerns of ECOWAS. He said ECOWAS was intent on achieving economic union through the adoption of common economic and financial policies, notably in the context of monetary union, and also adopting common policies in cultural and social affairs. He said the WTO and ECOWAS were heading in the same direction, and that closer cooperation was necessary to ensure the integration of West Africa into international trade flows. ECOWAS was the only African community in which individuals could freely circulate from one member state to another WT/COMTD/M/25 Page 4 without a visa. Customs papers and systems for the designation and codification of goods from 16 member states had been harmonised. As of 1 January 2000, products accepted for the ECOWAS free trade system would have a zero tariff across all member states. He recalled that ECOWAS was the cradle for automated system for customs data, a system for the processing of trade data, which was currently utilised by customs administrations in more than 50 countries across the world. ECOWAS had implemented a vast programme for the promotion of trade and raising awareness of economic operators about the trade potential in the region. Programmes were underway for land and telecommunication links, for road construction and rehabilitation, and a programme for monetary cooperation whose purpose was the creation of a single monetary zone. The legal framework was being updated so as to create a sound investment environment. He reiterated that the WTO and ECOWAS had to collaborate as partners who were mutual in their support of growth in trade and investment with a view to furthering development in West Africa.","WTCOMTDM25.pdf","Economic, Community, of, West, African, States, ECOWAS, Director-General, WTO, ECOWAS, CTD, ECOWAS, Liberia, Sierra, Leone, ECOWAS, ECOWAS, West, Africa, Members, ECOWAS, ECOWAS, WTO, ECOWAS, West, Africa, ECOWAS, Customs, ECOWAS, ECOWAS, ECOWAS, WTO, ECOWAS, West, Africa"
"1995",1995,"160","160.     The representative of Mauritius thanked the Secretariat for producing the Informal Note. He said the title made clear that the contents of the note were tentative suggestions and not hard and fast proposals. He said that the role of the CTD was, inter alia, to monitor all aspects of the participation of developing countries, including the implementation of special and differential provisions and the delivery of technical assistance. It was important not to lose sight of the past work of the CTD. For instance the CTD was recognised as having produced the work plan on LDCs for the Singapore Ministerial Conference. He said that the integration of developing countries into the multilateral trading system raised a number of issues, including, inter alia, special and differential treatment, technical cooperation, notification issues, and consideration of the effects of agricultural reform on net-food importing developing countries. Bearing this in mind, it remained for the CTD to decide what was rational, feasible and acceptable for it to do. He concluded by stating, in response to an observation made by the representative of the United States, that his neither his delegation nor others sought to create new categories in the WTO. All that was sought was an examination of the concerns of small and vulnerable economies.","WTCOMTDM25.pdf","Mauritius, Secretariat, CTD, CTD, CTD, Singapore, CTD, United, States, WTO"
"1996",1996,"161","161.    The representative of Brazil said that there was agreement that the preparatory process for the Seattle Ministerial Conference be handled by the General Council, and that there was little doubt as to the process by which this was to be done. It was agreed that the CTD had a role to play in the WTO and that its work was of a horizontal nature. It was also agreed that the CTD and other subsidiary bodies should discuss issues that had some bearing on the Ministerial Conference. It was the perception of her delegation that discussions held in the CTD would flow naturally to the General Council through proposals brought by individual delegations. As long as the CTD did not seek to innovate or inaugurate a process, and as long as the discussion centred around focussing the work programme of the CTD on preparations for the Ministerial Conference, her delegation did not perceive there to be a problem. She suggested that a pragmatic approach be taken, with a focus on issues such as special and differential treatment, technical cooperation, anti-dumping, and so forth. Her delegation shared the view expressed by the European Communities that the priority at that moment was to collect issues for discussion, with a view to deciding subsequently as to the specific areas on which work was to be conducted.","WTCOMTDM25.pdf","Brazil, Seattle, Ministerial, Conference, General, Council, CTD, WTO, CTD, CTD, General, Council, CTD, CTD"
"1997",1997,"162","162.     The representative of Colombia said his delegation agreed that the preparation of the Seattle Ministerial Conference came under the mandate of the General Council. Nevertheless, his delegation viewed with sympathy the suggestion that the CTD make a contribution to the General Council. In this perspective, his delegation looked favourably on the list of topics presented by the representative of Egypt, and the complementary proposals made by Morocco. However, given that only six months remained until the Ministerial Conference, a pragmatic approach which would focus on a few specific issues was required. In keeping with the suggestions made by the delegation of India, these issues were the difficulties faced by developing countries in the implementation of Uruguay Round Agreements; special and differential treatment; and technical cooperation.","WTCOMTDM25.pdf","Colombia, Seattle, Ministerial, Conference, General, Council, CTD, General, Council, Egypt, Morocco, India, Uruguay"
"1998",1998,"163","163.    The representative of Guatemala said his delegation was in full agreement with the statement made by the representative of Mauritius to the effect that small and vulnerable economies were in no way seeking to establish a separate category within the Membership of the WTO. It was, rather, necessary that the limitations faced by small and vulnerable countries in the appropriation of the WT/COMTD/M/25 Page 44 benefits of the trade liberalisation promoted by the WTO be properly understood, especially in the context of the forthcoming negotiations, during which these limitations should be taken into account. The representative of Guatemala said his delegation were in agreement with the themes mentioned by the delegation of India, namely, implementation issues, technical assistance and special and differential treatment. However, small and vulnerable economies had further concerns in addition to these, such as the restricted size of domestic markets and production; the concentration of their production in certain agricultural commodities; and their insignificant level of industrial development. It was important that these limitations be recognised, and that joint mechanisms be sought that enabled small economies to share in the common benefits of the multilateral trading system, and not simply to incur obligation with which it was difficult to comply. His delegation was perfectly aware that the major responsibility lay internally, and Guatemala intended to fulfil its responsibility.","WTCOMTDM25.pdf","Guatemala, Mauritius, WTO, WTO, Guatemala, India, Guatemala"
"1999",1999,"164","164.     The representative of Panama supported the statements made by the delegations of Egypt and Morocco. Her delegation shared the view expressed by the delegation of Switzerland that the CTD should provide a contribution to the Ministerial Conference, and in this regard should seek to prioritise themes for the Ministerial Conference. One such priority was a contribution to the declaration. Her delegation supported the holding of a seminar on special and differential treatment, and concrete recommendations arising out of this could be brought to the Ministerial Conference.","WTCOMTDM25.pdf","Panama, Egypt, Morocco, Switzerland"

ASEAN agreed that the responsibility for the scope, modalities and so forth of future negotiations lay with the General Council. It was nevertheless to recognise that the CTD had a vital role in providing inputs on developmental aspects to the Seattle Ministerial Conference. He said that it was difficult to avoid some degree of duplication of the work of other committees given the horizontal nature of the CTD's work. ASEAN were of the view that the inputs of the CTD should be ready in good time in order that they be considered and incorporated before the Seattle Ministerial Conference.","WTCOMTDM25.pdf","Malaysia, ASEAN, ASEAN, Egypt, ASEAN, General, Council, CTD, Seattle, Ministerial, Conference, CTD, ASEAN, CTD, Seattle, Ministerial, Conference"
"2001",2001,"166","166.     The representative of Bolivia thanked the Secretariat for the Informal Note. He said that his delegation had repeatedly expressed in the General Council that the General Council was the only appropriate forum to discuss preparatory work for the Ministerial Conference. He said the contribution of the CTD should therefore concentrate on the subject of implementation, taking into account both the difficulties developing countries have experienced in implementing WTO agreements owing to shortfalls in human and institutional capacity, and also difficulties experienced in market access. He said implementation covered the issues of special and differential treatment and technical assistance. He said that implementation also entailed working in accordance with the Geneva Ministerial Declaration, in which concern was expressed at the marginalisation of LDCs. He said he fully agreed with the representatives of Guatemala and Mauritius that there was no intention to create of separate categories of Members, but rather to ensure that the diversity of developing countries be recognised. An analysis of implementation would show that there were general difficulties common to all developing countries, and some that were specific to certain countries as a function of their level of development and particularities in their trade and economic structure.","WTCOMTDM25.pdf","Bolivia, Secretariat, General, Council, General, Council, CTD, WTO, Guatemala, Mauritius, Members"

She was unable to support the proposals made by Egypt and Morocco owing to her absence from the CTD at the time, but looked forward to learning more about the proposals. She said the whole issue of small economies was one of different levels of development, rather than of categorisation, and she sought to reassure the delegation of the United States in this respect. She said that the issues of implementation, special and differential treatment, and technical assistance were of importance and should be the focus of the work of the CTD.","WTCOMTDM25.pdf","Barbados, Secretariat, Egypt, Morocco, CTD, United, States, CTD"

She said her delegation would go along with the consensus that seemed to have emerged regarding procedure. She said her delegation wished to flag the following substantive issues: first, trade facilitation, which was a subject that her delegation believed fell within the purview of the CTD, and regarding which the CTD could make specific recommendations, particularly in the light of complications faced by developing countries in the implementation of Uruguay Round Agreements. Second, her delegation believed that Part IV of the GATT provided the mandate for the CTD to look into trade problems faced by developing countries. A situation had arisen where actions taken by countries had failed to address the concerns embodied in Part IV. Her delegation were of the view that a report on Part IV of GATT 1994 be considered, given that it had been drafted at a time when rules covered only trade in goods, whereas presently rules covered trade in agriculture and services as well. Third, she said that preference margins under the GSP had been eroded, adding that her delegation, along with others, had submitted to the General Council proposals regarding this issue. While some argued that preferences had led to an inefficient allocation of resources, Sri Lanka was of the view that preferences had generated benefits. Finally, her delegation associated itself fully with the statements made by the delegations of Mauritius, Guatemala, Barbados and Bolivia regarding the problem of small economies. The subject of small economies should be included in the list of issues regarding a possible input to the Seattle Ministerial Conference. She drew attention to the specific issue of customs revenue, highlighting the importance of such sources of revenue to small economies for the purposes of implementing development programmes. She said the Sri Lankan government had undertaken research which demonstrated the revenue implications of trade liberalisation. She said that Sri Lanka, like other small economies, did not seek the creation of a special category within the WTO but rather the recognition of the concerns faced by small economies.","WTCOMTDM25.pdf","Sri, Lanka, Secretariat, CTD, Egypt, Morocco, CTD, CTD, Uruguay, GATT, CTD, GATT, GSP, General, Council, Sri, Lanka, Mauritius, Guatemala, Barbados, Bolivia, Seattle, Ministerial, Conference, Sri, Lanka, WTO"

"2006",2006,"170","170.    The Chairperson said that 24 delegations had intervened on this agenda item, demonstrating its importance. She said the Informal Note had provided a useful basis for discussions. On the basis of the deliberations that had been held, it was necessary to identify the points that could be submitted to the General Council in order that useful contribution to the Seattle Ministerial Conference be prepared. It was also necessary to consider the longer term work programme. She requested the Secretariat to produce a new Informal Note as soon as possible on the basis of a number of suggestions made by delegations, following from the statements made by the delegations of Egypt and Morocco, to facilitate discussions during the 26th Session of the CTD scheduled for 7 July 1999. She expressed the hope that the contribution made by the CTD to the General Council would be as important as that made by the CTD prior to the Singapore Ministerial Conference.","WTCOMTDM25.pdf","Chairperson, General, Council, Secretariat, Egypt, Morocco, CTD, CTD, General, Council, CTD"

The representative of the European Communities reiterated that recommendations would be prepared by the General Council. One possibility for the CTD was to gather the points made by various delegations regarding possible inputs, and structure them according to paragraphs 8, 9 and 10 of the Geneva Ministerial Declaration. He noted that there appeared to be a large degree of consensus regarding the issues of implementation, special and differential treatment, and technical assistance, and said that the CTD should begin work on this forthwith.","WTCOMTDM25.pdf","European, Communities, CTD, European, Communities, General, Council, CTD, CTD"

"2014",2014,"178","178.     The representative of Brazil said she wished to further explain the position taken by her delegation. Her delegation had already taken a similar position on the Council on Trade in Services, where it had , made known its view that no specific tasks were to be undertaken in subsidiary bodies and presented to the General Council in the context of preparations for the Ministerial Conference. Nothing precluded delegations from bringing to the General Council specific proposals that were the result of work carried out in subsidiary bodies such as the CTD. However, unless the General Council specifically mandated the CTD to undertake a specific task regarding the preparation of the Ministerial, her delegation were of the view that the CTD should not attempt to make such a contribution, as this would create a precedent which could lead other subsidiary bodies to do likewise. This would be problematic for developing countries who typically had small delegations and who consequently would not be able to control work across a number of different subsidiary bodies. She said that the Geneva Ministerial Declaration clearly mandated the General Council with the task of preparing the Third Ministerial Conference, and hence the work should be conducted in the General Council, at which all delegations could be present all the time. She said that the CTD had an important role, and should discuss issues pertaining to the Third Ministerial Conference, and should help developing countries to prepare their positions for the Ministerial Conference. Delegations could then bring to the General Council their proposals that stemmed from the discussion of the CTD, but her delegation could not agree to a formal, structured proposal on the part of the CTD.

"2016",2016,"18","18.      The representative of the West African Economic and Monetary Union thanked Members of the CTD for granting it ad hoc observer status on a meeting-by-meeting basis. WAEMU comprised eight countries of West Africa which had as a common currency the CFA franc. The countries were Benin, Burkina Faso, Côte d'Ivoire, Guinea-Bissau, Mali, Niger, Senegal and Togo. These countries in 1994 decided to transform their monetary union into economic union with five main objectives: the establishment of a common market based on the free movement of goods, services, persons, and capital; the establishment of a common trade policy vis-à-vis third countries; to ensure the convergence of political policy through a multilateral surveillance procedure; harmonisation of taxation policy and coordination of sectoral policy. Significant progress had been made since 1994 especially with regard to the common market; as of 1 January 2000, products from the Union would circulate at free of duty. For products from third countries, a common external tariff would also be implemented as of 1 January 2000. The tariff set the highest level of customs duty at 21 per cent; prior to 1997, member States had rates of between 38 and 65 per cent, and the rate of 21 per cent therefore represented an important effort in participating in globalisation. In the area of taxation, a harmonisation process had been developed, and was to be progressively applied in consideration of constraints faced by member States. Regarding economic policy coordination, criteria of budgetary surveillance had been put into place, and were considered half-yearly to examine how policies can be harmonised.","WTCOMTDM25.pdf","West, African, Economic, and, Monetary, Union, Members, CTD, WAEMU, West, Africa, Benin, Burkina, Faso, Guinea-Bissau, Mali, Niger, Senegal, Togo"

Trade liberalisation was based on the removal of tariff and non tariff barriers, and the establishment of a free-trade area between member countries. Two members, Morocco and Tunisia, had signed an agreement which would enter into effect in July 1999. The Union envisaged that the free trade area between members would be done in coordination with the association agreements of the European Union, creating bilateral free trade agreements with each of the countries in the Union. Maximum encouragement and promotion of the investment was given through the provision of national treatment and MFN, as well as various financial and juridical incentives. The AMU hoped to collaborate closely with the WTO and the CTD particularly, in order to harmonise its efforts in the interest of the disciplines of the WTO.","WTCOMTDM25.pdf","Arab, Maghreb, Union, CTD, CTD, Morocco, Tunisia, Union, European, Union, MFN, WTO, CTD, WTO"

The completion and circulation of the Note had been delayed because of the exceptionally low rate of returns to the Questionnaire first circulated by the Secretariat on 12 November 1998 with an initial deadline of the completed questionnaire fixed for 25 January 1999. To date, only five Members had completed and returned the questionnaires. These were: Hong Kong, China; Japan; Madagascar, Norway and Singapore. This is unchanged from the situation at the informal consultations held on 5 May.

"2039",2039,"26","26.     The Director of the Development Division said that, unfortunately, there had been no new replies since the meeting of 5 May, despite the expressions of willingness that had been made. Replies that had been given by five countries – Hong Kong, China; Japan, Norway, Madagascar and Singapore – gave a picture of what had been done and what remained to be done regarding the implementation of provisions on Special and Differential Treatment. He drew the attention of the CTD to the reply by Madagascar – an LDC – which made links between several special and differential provisions and the need for technical assistance. In terms of information in the Secretariat, requests had been made to each division to provide information relating to the special and differential provisions or development related provisions of each of the WTO agreements of understandings for which they were responsible. A substantial amount of information had been provided based on discussion in the relevant Committees, and this information was being analysed and reviewed for completeness. Discussions held in the context of the General Council Intersessional process were not dealt with, these discussions being covered by checklists that had been circulated periodically by the Ministerial Sessions Division. The main areas where difficulties in the application of Special and Differential provisions had been reported by developing countries included Dispute Settlement, SPS, TRIMS, Textiles and the Net-Food Importing provisions of the Agreement on agriculture. He added that there were some areas in which difficulties reported in other fora, such as the Intersessional process, had not been raised strongly, if at all, in Committee meetings. Such areas included the Committee on Balance-of-Payments Restrictions, the Committee on Import Licensing and the Committee on Market Access. In addition to these sources of information, the Trade Policy Review Mechanism had, in its reviews, shown a number of areas where the treatment of developing countries had been seen by themselves as having been inadequate. Areas cited included the operation of GSP schemes; the treatment of countries under anti-dumping procedures, difficulties in the operation of balance-of-payments provisions, problems related to standards and SPS, backloading of liberalisation under the Agreement on Textiles and Clothing, the ability of small members to participate effectively in the DSU, and the clearly identified need for technical assistance in the fields of customs valuation, standards and tariff negotiations.","WTCOMTDM25.pdf","Director, Development, Division, Hong, Kong, China, Japan, Norway, Madagascar, Singapore, CTD, Madagascar, Secretariat, WTO, General, Council, Intersessional, SPS, Committee, Committee, on, Balance-of-Payments, Restrictions, Committee, on, Import, Licensing, Committee, on, Market, Access, Trade, Policy, Review, Mechanism, GSP, SPS"

The Director of the Development Division said it would be very difficult, if not impossible, to give a meaningful answer to the question of difficulties in implementation of special and differential provisions on the basis of the few replies that had been submitted by members. One possibility would be to present, as an informal paper initially, the essence of the replies received by the five delegations – and any others, were they to submit replies – and also the essence of the material collected from within the Secretariat. The possibility existed, once delegations had provided further input on the basis of the informal paper, to present a formal working paper of the CTD. He concluded by reiterating that information by members was one of the essential elements for the completion of the paper, and he appealed to all members to present answers to the questionnaire circulated by the Secretariat.","WTCOMTDM25.pdf","Director, Development, Division, Secretariat, CTD, Secretariat"

He said that it would be useful to recall the framework within which the decision had been taken by the CTD to prepare the questionnaire. His delegation had, at the CTD meeting of June 1998, agreed to work on three aspects in order to make                                                                                      WT/COMTD/M/25                                                                                              Page 7 operational the discussion of Special and Differential Treatment within the CTD. The first aspect was the assessment of problems encountered by developed, developing and least developed countries in the implementation of Special and Differential provisions. The second aspect was the evaluation of economic and commercial effects of the implementation, or non-implementation, of special and differential provisions since the conclusion of the Uruguay Round. The third aspect consisted of the evaluation of the concept of special and differential treatment itself, in order to revitalise and operationalize it for the benefit of WTO Members. The questionnaire on special and differential treatment circulated by the Secretariat thus fell within the first of the three aspects. He noted that the questionnaire method had proved to be problematic in a number of international organisations, mainly due to the fact that some countries lacked the capacity to respond in detail to the questions asked. He said his delegation believed that while the CTD should persevere with the questionnaire, it should also reflect on alternative methods of evaluating difficulties in the implementation of Special and Differential provisions. His delegation found the suggestions made by the Director of the Development Division were acceptable, and could go along with them.","WTCOMTDM25.pdf","Morocco, Secretariat, CTD, CTD, Uruguay, Round, WTO, Members, Secretariat, CTD, Director"

He hoped that the three proposals his delegation had made in June 1998 would not effectively be buried; it was the conviction of his and other delegations that these proposals represented the way forward if the concept of special and differential treatment was to be meaningful.","WTCOMTDM25.pdf","Morocco, CTD, WTO"

His delegation was extremely disappointed that the contribution of the Secretariat in relation to the issue of special and differential treatment had not been forthcoming. His delegation had indicated on numerous occasions that responses to questions should not be a precondition to the preparation of the paper. One year had passed since the proposals made by the delegation of Morocco, and an analytical paper on aspects of special and differential treatment was still awaited. His delegation had pointed to a number of sources of information on special and differential treatment, but that nevertheless the paper had not been forthcoming. His delegation had on a number of occasions said that technical assistance activities, Trade Policy Reviews, minutes of meeting and other sources could be used. In addition, his delegation had indicated that the paper on special and differential treatment it had submitted to the General Council and to the CTD, as WT/COMTD/W/49, was to be considered the Egyptian contribution to the discussion of special and differential treatment, and to the paper to be prepared by the Secretariat. Much discussion had taken place in the General Council, and a number of papers had been submitted, including one by the delegation of India. There had also been an extensive discussion of special and differential treatment in various committees in connection with various agreements. His delegation took note of the statement made by the Director of the Development Division, thanked him for it, and expressed the hope that the note would be circulated as soon as possible. The issue of special and differential treatment was very important for a number of developing countries, and his delegation hoped that it could be addressed with the urgency it deserved.

He said that implementation issues recurred as a leitmotif in the CTD and other committees. The lack of an encouraging response was in part due to the fact that members were wary of what precisely could be done. He said that the compendium of statements made at the Ministerial Conference provided information on implementation difficulties. There was an abundance of sources of information which should be put to good use, and hence the lack of response to the questionnaire did not have to be taken to be a problem. It was important that statements made and papers submitted be utilised, lest they remain as mere papers without further use.","WTCOMTDM25.pdf","Mauritius, Morocco, Secretariat, CTD"

The representative of the European Communities thanked the Director of the Development Division for his ideas on ensuring progress on the paper, and indicated that his delegation were agreeable to those ideas. Second, his delegation were of the view that the various papers submitted regarding implementation issues should not be confused with the exercise that was being carried out by the CTD. What was required was concrete evidence regarding difficulties in the implementation of provisions for special and differential treatment, whereas most of the submissions made in the General Council debate were of a more generic nature that did not identify, by agreement or by country, specific difficulties in the implementation of special and differential provisions. Third, regarding alternative means of reflecting on special and differential treatment suggested by Morocco, he indicated that one members State of the Communities was discussing with the Secretariat the possibility of holding a seminar on the implementation of special and differential treatment before the summer break. More information would be provided to the CTD once dates had been finalised.","WTCOMTDM25.pdf","European, Communities, Director, General, Council, Morocco, Secretariat, CTD"

The representative of Pakistan expressed the support of his delegation for the statement made by the delegation of Morocco, and extended that support to the proposal of holding a seminar on special and differential treatment.

The representative of Cuba thanked the Director of the Development Division for his ideas regarding the completion of the paper on special and differential provisions, and expressed the support of her delegation for the idea of circulating an informal paper for Members to comment on. She said her delegation supported the proposal made by Egypt that the Secretariat examine alternative sources of information in order to complete the paper on the implementation of special and differential treatment provisions, as well as the proposal made by Morocco to hold a seminar on the evaluation of special and differential treatment.","WTCOMTDM25.pdf","Cuba, Director, Members, Egypt, Secretariat, Morocco"
"2050",2050,"36","36.     The representative of the Republic of Korea said his delegation were of the view that the low level of responses to the questionnaire stemmed in part from the vagueness of several special and differential provisions. There were several different types of provisions: some specified transition times for the implementation of agreements, while others stated that implementing countries should make best efforts to take into account the interests of developing and least developed Members. His delegation shared the view expressed by the European Communities that the implementation of special and differential treatment had not been discussed elsewhere on a point by point basis. He added that the discussion of the implementation of provisions for special and differential treatment on a point by point basis could be taken up under Agenda Item 2:H dealing with possible inputs into the Seattle Ministerial Conference.","WTCOMTDM25.pdf","Republic, of, Korea, Members, Seattle, Ministerial, Conference"

"2052",2052,"38","38.     The representative of Japan supported the remarks made by the European Communities. From the outset, there had been a recognition of the lack of specific resources, which is why the Secretariat had requested member states to provide input as to the difficulties they faced under specific agreements. He recalled that former Deputy Director-General, Mr. Hoda, had stated that it was difficult to provide a correct analysis without member-specific input. It was therefore not appropriate to blame the Secretariat for not having completed the task, but that responsibility lay more with delegations. He supported the proposal made by the Director of the Development Division that an informal paper be circulated, as this would elicit comments and contributions from delegations.","WTCOMTDM25.pdf","Japan, Secretariat, Director-General, Hoda, Secretariat, Director, Development, Division"
"2053",2053,"39","39.      The representative of Uruguay said the question of special and differential treatment had been discussed extensively in the General Council, along with other issues affecting developing countries. While some of the statements made in the General Council had been of a general nature, the statements made by his delegation, and others, had been very specific, identifying concrete problems under specific agreements. He noted that a number of checklists had been prepared in connection with the General Council process. These documents were informal documents, and could constitute the basis of work to be done by the Secretariat, as they contained a wealth of information on a number of topics discussed by delegations. This information could be extracted and utilised; it was important that there be no duplication of work by the Secretariat. He recalled that his delegation had submitted a proposal which set out, in relation to the checklists, a methodology which enabled the identification of different themes discussed, and the establishing of a certain order to questions raised and answers thereto.","WTCOMTDM25.pdf","Uruguay, General, Council, General, Council, General, Council, Secretariat, Secretariat"

The Chairperson thanked the outgoing chairman of the Sub-Committee, the Permanent Representative of Denmark, Ambassador Hans Henrik Bruun, for his able leadership of the Sub- Committee on Least-Developed Countries. Ambassador Bruun had successfully led the Sub- Committee's work last year. During his tenure as chairman, two issues were brought forward by the Sub-Committee through the Committee on Trade and Development to the attention of the General Council; market access for least-developed country exports, and difficulties faced by least-developed countries in implementing WTO Agreements. It was also on his initiative that the Secretariat was asked to begin to compile information on the market access barriers facing least-developed countries' exports. She was confident that Ambassador Bruun would continue to participate actively in the work of the Sub-Committee.","WTCOMTDM25.pdf","Chairperson, chairman, Denmark, Ambassador, Hans, Henrik, Bruun, Sub, -, Committee, on, Least-Developed, Countries, Ambassador, Bruun, Sub, -, Committee, chairman, Sub-Committee, Committee, on, Trade, and, Development, General, Council, WTO, Secretariat, Ambassador, Bruun"
"2055",2055,"40","40.      The representative of Bangladesh said the issue of special and differential treatment was of great importance to his delegation. He shared the views of the delegation of the Republic of Korea to the effect that the unclear nature of provisions for special and differential treatment made their implementation difficult. Special and differential treatment amounted to no more than a sugar coating of the WTO agreements, and had proved to be of little substance. He felt, however, that there was still time for Members to remedy existing lacunae in these provisions, which were of an autonomous nature, whose implementation depended on the good intent of developed country partners, and which were not enforceable. There was a lack of urgency surrounding the implementation of provisions for special and differential treatment. Members should address this problem of special and differential treatment rather than delve into the particularities of individual agreements. Given that the WTO was entering a new phase in which the Marrakesh agreements were being reviewed, and given the recognition by the international community of the development needs of developing countries, the issue of special and differential treatment could be examined in its entirety in the forthcoming negotiations, with a view to developing provisions that were less autonomous, more enforceable, and could translate into binding commitments. His delegation supported the proposal by the European Communities that there be a seminar on special and differential treatment as early as possible. A seminar would bring out issues for discussion and would provide guidance as to areas of work that would enable the development of more substantive and implementable provisions for special and differential treatment.","WTCOMTDM25.pdf","Bangladesh, Republic, of, Korea, WTO, Members, Members, WTO, Marrakesh"

While he did not contest the view expressed by the representative of Egypt that its was possible make progress on the completion of the paper without further contributions, his delegation felt that the document would be more representative and comprehensive if more responses were given, particularly from developing countries. His delegation agreed with the delegation of Japan, and echoed by the European Communities, that responses to the questionnaire would provide detailed information not readily accessible in other WTO fora. The seminar would be useful as a supplement to the questionnaire, but that this should not detract from the importance of the questionnaire.

"2057",2057,"42","42.      The representative of Switzerland said his delegation supported the proposal made by the Director of the Development Division as a way out of the current deadlock. He said his delegation did not wish to blame the Secretariat and recalled that the WTO was a ""Member-driven"" organisation in the first place. He said that one reason why there were only a few replies was the fact that the subject of special and differential treatment was very broad, covering a range of agreements, and thus the completion of the questionnaire demanded considerable resources. The seminar could be a useful way forward for the time being, but that this did not make the completion of a questionnaire unnecessary, especially as the information required in response to the questionnaire would have to be provided in order to prepare for the seminar.","WTCOMTDM25.pdf","Switzerland, Director, Development, Division, Secretariat, WTO"
"2058",2058,"43","43.     The representative of the European Communities said that the representative of Uruguay had made a useful point regarding the use of checklists. However, the process of identification of issues was an evolving process. The purpose of answering the questionnaire was different, as it sought to provide an opportunity to delegations which felt that there were shortcomings in the implementation to point to specific agreements where a provision existed, but had not been implemented. She emphasised that the concept of implementation was not a generic concept but one that had legal implications, and hence it was necessary to point to specific examples of non implementation. It was important to differentiate clearly between lack of implementation of specific provisions under specific agreements, which could be addressed in a concrete manner with a view to finding solutions, and a general assessment which may lead to further negotiations and thence to changes in agreements once agreed.","WTCOMTDM25.pdf","European, Communities, Uruguay"
"2059",2059,"44","44.      The representative of Egypt said it was not the intention of his delegation to blame the Secretariat, but rather to indicate that his delegation had been awaiting the paper on the implementation of provisions for special and differential treatment for a very long time, and that it was not necessary to await further information in order to make progress on the paper. He agreed that the work of the Secretariat would be facilitated if more responses from developing and developed Members were forthcoming. Regarding the point made by the European Communities on the identification of specific examples of non implementation, he said that the paper WT/COMTD/W/49 contained a number of examples. One such example was in relation to Article 10.6 of the TBT agreement, which indicated that the Secretariat of the WTO should draw the attention of developing countries to notifications relating to products of particular interest to them. This was also to be found in paragraph 9 of annex B of the SPS agreement. He said that this provision was not implemented in a systematic manner, and that this issue had been raised in the Committee on SPS. A second example concerned Article 9 of the SPS agreement which stated that ""Where substantial investments are required in order for an exporting developing country Member to fulfil the sanitary or phytosanitary requirements of an importing Member, the latter shall consider providing such technical assistance as will permit the developing country Member to maintain and expand its market access opportunities for the product involved"". There was no information as to the implementation of this provision. If responses were not coming through the questionnaire, it should be indicated that there was no information. If there was no information, one possible conclusion would be to change the provision of information into a notification obligation.","WTCOMTDM25.pdf","Egypt, Secretariat, Secretariat, Members, TBT, Secretariat, WTO, SPS, Committee, SPS, SPS, Member, Member, Member"
"2060",2060,"45","45.      The representative of Egypt said that an example of provisions that were implemented in all their terms were provisions for transitional time-periods. There were no difficulties in implementing transitional periods, whether in relation to Customs Valuation, TRIPS, SPS or others. Another example of areas where there were no difficulties in implementation was in relation to Annex VII(b) of the Agreement on Subsidies and Countervailing Duties, which stated that countries with a per capita income of less than US$1,000 had certain rights. These rights were being used. In contrast, if one considered Article 15 of the Agreement on Anti-Dumping Measures, which stipulated that special regard was to be given by developed countries to the special situation of developing country members, no response was given to questions as to how such a provision was being implemented. Article 15 also stipulated that the possibility of constructive remedies was to be explored prior to the                                                                                     WT/COMTD/M/25                                                                                            Page 11 imposition of anti-dumping measures, yet when information was requested of developed countries in relation to the implementation of this provision, the response given was that there was no obligation to respond.","WTCOMTDM25.pdf","Egypt, Customs, Valuation, SPS"
"2061",2061,"46","46.      The representative of Egypt said that there was thus a range of issues and a range of problems, and the whole subject was complex. There were various categories of special and differential treatment with various problems: while some provisions were vague and required clarification, others were very clear, but were still not implemented as there was no legal obligation to inform Members regarding implementation. This was precisely why a paper by the Secretariat was needed, in order to ascertain the difficulties associated with the subject of special and differential treatment, to address the problems identified, and facilitate discussion on the issue. His delegation were concerned at the delay in the preparation of the document, especially as it had been expected that the paper would be ready by the 25th Session of the CTD, as indicated by former Deputy Director-General, Mr. Hoda.","WTCOMTDM25.pdf","Egypt, Members, Secretariat, CTD, Director-General, Hoda"
"2062",2062,"47","47.      The representative of India supported the Moroccan proposal for a seminar on special and differential treatment and the statement made by the delegation of Egypt. Regarding the Secretariat note, it was true that responses to the questionnaire had not been forthcoming. It was equally true that some Members had made statements in the General Council. He said his delegation would copy their proposal relating to special and differential treatment made in the General Council to the Director of the Development Division. While the proposal did not follow entirely the format of the questionnaire, it would provide information that could be used in the preparation of the note.","WTCOMTDM25.pdf","India, Egypt, Secretariat, Members, General, Council, General, Council, Director"
"2063",2063,"48","48.      The representative of India said that the problem with special and differential treatment was threefold. First some provisions were unclear; second, where they were clear there was no binding obligation; and third, there was no political will to implement obligations where they existed. The proposals made by the Indian delegation called for wholesale amendments in some areas. He refered to the example of Article 15 of the Agreement on Anti-Dumping Measures, cited by the representative of Egypt, and said the problem lay in the fact that Article 15 began with the words ""It is recognised…"". These words effectively reduced the obligation on developed countries to nil, and developed countries were thus able in all legitimacy to tell developing countries that they recognised that special regard was to be given to developing countries, but that developed countries would take no action and that, furthermore, there was nothing developing countries could do either. Were these words ""It is recognised"" to be deleted, Article 15 would become a legally binding obligation which had to be enforced, and developing countries would challenge developed countries under the Dispute Settlement Mechanism in the event of non-implementation. With weak language, and without political will, special and differential treatment would remain on paper, and for the next 40 years developed countries would continue to affirm that special and differential treatment provisions existed, but that nothing would be done to implement them. The problem was thus a little more complicated than intimated by the Japanese delegation: it was not simply a question of replying to the questionnaire. The issues involved were more complex, as pointed out by the representative of Norway.","WTCOMTDM25.pdf","India, Egypt, Norway"
"2064",2064,"49","49.      The representative of India said that a critical phase had been reached, at which developing countries were trying to change the face of the organisation. There was active participation, as there had been in the Uruguay Round, and there would be much more active participation at the Seattle Ministerial Conference. With this was likely to come pressure for change. He said that regarding special and differential treatment, the thought was there, as was the provision, but there was no legally binding obligation. There had been in the past a gross imbalance in negotiating strength between developed and developing countries. Offers regarding special and differential treatment were made on a ""take it or leave it"" basis, and developing countries often preferred that there be provisions couched in expressions such as ""It is recognised that…"" rather than not to have anything at all. That situation had changed, and developing countries legitimately sought more. He admitted that his WT/COMTD/M/25 Page 12 delegation had been remiss in not providing a response to the questionnaire, and that they were willing to make available their proposals to the CTD. He said that there was no dearth of proposals regarding special and differential treatment, and mentioned proposals submitted by the Egyptian and Pakistan delegations as examples. His delegation looked forward to a meaningful discussion in the CTD.","WTCOMTDM25.pdf","India, Uruguay, Round, Seattle, Ministerial, Conference, CTD, Pakistan, CTD"

The Chairperson said Ambassador Bruun had asked her to convey to the CTD that he deeply regretted that his absence from Geneva on the day did not allow him to participate in this meeting of transfer of chairmanship.

If the Secretariat could help developing countries, well and good; if not, developing countries would be left where they were. Brazil, as a developing country, had limited resources. His delegation were not expecting from the Secretariat specific comments on specific provisions for special and differential treatment, with specific indications as to how to proceed. He did not believe that the problems faced by the Secretariat were due to lack of information and added that he sympathised with the Secretariat's position. He understood the comments made by the European Communities that the CTD should engage in a more specific debate than that which took place in the General Council. However, he did not believe that this was what delegations wanted. If all the Secretariat could provide was a paper with general comments on the implementation of special and differential provisions, that had to be accepted as what was feasible. If the paper could go further, it may then go further. What was unacceptable was that there be no document at all. He said the first phase was of the preparatory process was over, and the second phase was mid-way to completion, following which delegations would be involved in a negotiating and drafting phase, at which point if the paper was not ready it may as well be forgotten. He therefore agreed that the Director of the Development Division should circulate what was available, adding that it was necessary to be realistic about the matter.","WTCOMTDM25.pdf","Brazil, CTD, Secretariat, Brazil, Secretariat, Secretariat, Secretariat, CTD, General, Council, Secretariat, Director"

The representative of Senegal said that his delegation was undertaking an internal consultation at the level of the different committees responsible for different subjects within the WTO, and that his delegation would communicate its responses to the questionnaire as soon as possible. His delegation supported the proposal made by the delegation of Morocco concerning the holding of a seminar on special and differential treatment. This would respond to a concern frequently expressed by the G.15, and this context he wished to refer to work that had been carried out in New Delhi which had brought together India, Senegal, Egypt and Jamaica. Results from this work could feed into work undertaken in preparation for the seminar. His delegation welcomed with great interest the proposal put forward by the Secretariat to circulate an informal note. He recalled that the Secretariat had, following the completion of the Uruguay Round, prepared a document covering subjects of interest to developing countries. Given that special and differential treatment was one such subject, it was normal that after five years that one should examine the contents of the concept, as well as its scope and coverage; whether the concept had been operational; and improvements to be made in terms of rights available to developing countries and obligations for developed countries. Hence his delegation hoped that the proposed seminar could be held as soon as possible.","WTCOMTDM25.pdf","Senegal, WTO, Morocco, New, Delhi, India, Senegal, Egypt, Jamaica, Secretariat, Secretariat, Uruguay, Round"

The representative of Senegal concluded his statement by congratulating the eleven IGOs for their presence as observers on an ad hoc, meeting by meeting basis, and made specific mention of the two West African Organisations, namely ECOWAS and WAEMU. He said this demonstrated a constant desire of CTD members that developing countries participate actively in the work of the WTO. This was a signal that pointed to the role of developing countries at the Seattle Ministerial, and it was thus wholly legitimate that they concerned themselves with special and differential treatment. There was no doubt that when subjects like the GATS or the Agreement on Agriculture were broached, the subject of special and differential treatment would acquire much greater interest.","WTCOMTDM25.pdf","Senegal, ECOWAS, WAEMU, CTD, WTO, Seattle, Ministerial"
"2069",2069,"53","53.      The Director of the Development Division thanked delegations for their views and concerns, saying that it was indeed the intention of the Secretariat to produce a paper on basis of information in its possession.

"2071",2071,"55","55.      The representative of Morocco said he wished to draw a distinction of importance for the work of the CTD. He said that delegations needed to avoid confusing proposals made in the context of the preparatory process for the Ministerial Conference on one hand, with proposals relating to the substantive work of the CTD on the other. Thus when it was proposed that a seminar be held on the subject of special and differential treatment, one had to be clear in one's mind whether this was specifically in the context of the preparatory process for the Ministerial Conference or whether this concerned the substantive work of the CTD. This distinction needed to be kept in mind with respect to all items on the CTD's agenda. He emphasised that the CTD had a special responsibility in the context of the preparatory process for the Ministerial Conference, as had been the case in 1996, because questions related to development needed to be discussed within the CTD. As far as possible, information regarding the implementation of different agreements needed to be provided to the CTD that it may evaluate this information, and thus contribute to the application of paragraph 8 of the Geneva declaration. Whereas it was typically the role of the General Council to provide an overview of the organisation and its agreements, the CTD now had the possibility to provide such an overview and transmit it to the General Council. In order that this happen, the CTD should mandate the Chairperson to request from the Chairs of different committees information on the implementation of different agreements. Every effort should be made to ensure that developing and least developed countries have proposals for the Seattle Ministerial Conference. At the same time, a collective assessment was required from the CTD as an input into the Seattle Ministerial Conference.","WTCOMTDM25.pdf","Morocco, CTD, CTD, CTD, CTD, CTD, CTD, CTD, General, Council, CTD, General, Council, CTD, Chairperson, Seattle, Ministerial, Conference, CTD, Seattle, Ministerial, Conference"

"2074",2074,"58","58.       Dr. Cosgrove-Sacks began by stating that the purpose of her presentation was to address some development implications of electronic commerce and examine how electronic business could be used by developing and transition countries to build capacity. She wished to address three key issues: first, the fact that electronic business consisted of international supply chains; second, the importance of trade facilitation to ensure smooth movement of goods across borders, so that the efficiency gains from electronic commerce were effectively realised; and third, the importance of capacity building to allow developing countries to participate in electronic commerce.","WTCOMTDM25.pdf","Cosgrove-Sacks"
"2075",2075,"59","59.     She said that UN/ECE spanned North America and the whole European continent, an area that accounted for two-thirds of world trade. For over 30 years UN/ECE experts had been developing instruments such as standards and norms to facilitate international business. In order to be effective, WT/COMTD/M/25 Page 14 such standards and procedures needed to be global, which in turn required cooperation on a global scale. This realisation led to the establishment of the United Nations Centre for Facilitation of Procedures and Practices for Administration, Commerce and Transport (UN/CEFACT). While UN/CEFACT was based in the UN/ ECE, it had close and intensive links with the other United Nations regional economic commissions, and worked closely with the WTO.","WTCOMTDM25.pdf","UN/ECE, North, America, United, Nations, Centre, for, Facilitation, of, Procedures, and, Practices, for, Administration, Commerce, and, Transport, UN, /, ECE, United, Nations, WTO"

"2077",2077,"60","60.      Dr. Cosgrove–Sacks said that trade was part of an international supply chain, which ran from the initial trade enquiry to the delivery of the product. At various stages of the international supply chain, there took place activities which did not add any value, but which did cause costs to increase. Such activities were related to storing, handling, inspection, certification, and so forth. In all of these instances, there was tremendous potential for electronic commerce, and scope for improving the efficiency of the international supply chain. In the case of a food export supply chain, it was estimated that there were as many as 27 processes among 40 different parties, so that even a fairly rapid transaction took 12 weeks for completion. The question therefore was how to use the technologies and techniques of electronic commerce to reduce the length of the process, to generate more income and to enhance the participation of developing countries in international trade. It was necessary to examine the paradigm shift caused by electronic commerce in ways of doing business.","WTCOMTDM25.pdf","Cosgrove, Sacks"
"2078",2078,"61","61.      Dr. Cosgrove–Sacks refered to the CTD note ""Development Implications of Electronic Commerce"" (WT/COMTD/W/51) and said that UN/CEFACT were convinced of the analysis contained therein, namely that the benefits of electronic commerce were only possible if it was possible to reduce the physical, economic, juridical and policy constraints in doing business internationally. It was necessary to look, in the first instance, at the benefits of electronic commerce and assess how to reduce the costs of international trade procedures, and thus to focus on the role of trade facilitation. In this context she said that UN/CEFACT were pleased that some Members had proposed that trade facilitation be included in a possible millennium round of talks. Second, it was necessary to reduce transaction costs by building an effective global supply chain, and to integrate developing and transition countries into this global supply chain. Third, the investment in human and physical infrastructure that enabled participation in this new way of doing business needed to be addressed.","WTCOMTDM25.pdf","Cosgrove, CTD, Members"
"2079",2079,"62","62.      Dr. Cosgrove-Sacks said that electronic commerce had had its principal impact in the software and services sectors since it was possible to deliver the product through the same channels as by which the product had been ordered. However, when trade in goods was considered, one had to be concerned with how one delivered the goods and how one ordered and traded goods. Electronic commerce was thus about the synergy formed by the use of digital information, computerised business practices and the Internet. Electronic commerce was defined by UN/CEFACT as doing business electronically, through, inter alia, the sharing of standardised unstructured or structured business information by electronic means, and the use of such tools as electronic mail or messaging, the World Wide Web, smart cards, electronic funds transfers, automated data capture and bar codes, and electronic data interchange. The importance of electronic commerce was due to the fact that it resided in the overlap between business processes, institutions, and networks. The deliberations of international organisations should accordingly focus on the overlap between these three areas.","WTCOMTDM25.pdf","Cosgrove-Sacks"
"2080",2080,"63","63.     Dr. Cosgrove-Sacks said the concept of electronic commerce could be structured either by type of business relations or by type of commercial activity, and presented a matrix that structured the type of relations between three categories of partners (individuals, business, and government) which sent or received data and information electronically.           The center of the matrix covered business-to-business and business-to-government communications, where the exchange of data by electronic means was of supreme importance. Business-to-business relationships had become, financially, the most important part of electronic commerce. All of these relationships depended on the provision of good communication links, and one of the challenges for developing countries lay in the inadequacy of their telecommunications infrastructure.

"2081",2081,"64","64.      As stated before, a central challenge was the integration of developing countries into the international supply chain. One possible positive step was to reduce the barriers that were put up by regulatory bodies. This was a prerequisite not only for the development of international trade, but also for the development of electronic commerce. This brought up, again, the importance of a commitment to trade facilitation, to ensure that such barriers to trade were reduced. Second, it was necessary to deal with delays and uncertainties in business processes, such as legal issues, in the context of an international framework for electronic business. All commercial enterprises needed to be concerned with the effectiveness of business process, by simplifying and streamlining their business processes. A greater focus on electronic commerce as a means to increase revenue and value added was also needed.","WTCOMTDM25.pdf",""
"2082",2082,"65","65.     Dr. Cosgrove-Sacks said the United Nations strove to create an efficient environment for developing countries. UN/CEFACT was the major source of standards and recommendations for best practice relating to business process, and was at the core of producing ground rules for the digital market-place. UN/CEFACT worked to enhance the information infrastructure, had a memorandum of understanding with the International Standards Office and the International Electro-technical Commission (IEC), and were concerned to build capacity through the use of standards. It was through basic standards that UN/CEFACT provided the basic tools that enabled electronic commerce to work. UN/CEFACT also sought to build capacity by ensuring a real participation in international supply chains, and encouraged developing countries to ""learn by doing"". Finally UN/CEFACT advocated capacity building through technical assistance, and drew attention in this respect to the work of other regional UN agencies and UNCTAD.","WTCOMTDM25.pdf","Cosgrove-Sacks, United, Nations, International, Standards, Office, International, Electro-technical, Commission, IEC, UN, UNCTAD"

"2084",2084,"67","67.       The representative of Mexico thanked Dr. Cosgrove-Sacks for her presentation. His first comment had to do with access, and specifically the fact that connection charges were high in developing countries. Small and medium enterprises (SMEs) preferred to acquire what was essential before embarking on electronic commerce. A fundamental need was to lower access costs in order to ensure that SMEs had access and therefore participate in international trade. A second point was that protection of content was unequal, in that developing countries were recipients of contents and not producers. For instance, countries like his which sought to produce catalogues reflecting their own culture and language were not able to do so. Third, there were questions of confidentiality and security in electronic business. Fourth, there was a lack of an ""electronic business culture"" or ethos, and the development of such a culture needed to be supported by international institutions. Fifth, he recalled Dr. Cosgrove-Sacks' statement that the future of electronic commerce would be dominated by business-to-business transactions, and said that a greater knowledge was needed of the view of firms on as to how such transactions took place. Finally, he noted that the presentation touched on the facilitation of trade, and pointed out that there was a clear distinction between electronic commerce and trade facilitation, and that it was quite mistaken to say that the two were one and the same thing.","WTCOMTDM25.pdf","Mexico, Cosgrove-Sacks, Cosgrove-Sacks"
"2085",2085,"68","68.     The representative of Panama recalled that Dr. Cosgrove-Sacks had mentioned in the course of the presentation that one of the problems experienced in electronic business was that of reengineering business processes, and raised the question of whether there was any example of countries where businesses had reengineered their processes in order to implement the SAP industrial process. He wished also to know what UN/ECE were doing to facilitate the reengineering process in developing countries, especially in the light of difficulties experienced in developed countries in the execution of reengineering.","WTCOMTDM25.pdf","Panama, Cosgrove-Sacks, SAP"
"2086",2086,"69","69.     Dr. Cosgrove-Sacks said she agreed entirely that the core problem lay in fostering an electronic business culture in developing and transition economies, adding that this was an issue on which institutions concerned with capacity building should focus. The UN/ECE had a limited role in WT/COMTD/M/25 Page 16 capacity building, insofar as its essential focus lay in the promotion of standards and norms, and the promotion of best practices in electronic business and trade facilitation. The UN/ECE did work with other regional UN commissions, but left to UNCTAD, the ITC and other capacity-building organisations the bulk of the work in promoting an electronic business culture. Referring to the distinction drawn by the representative of Mexico between trade facilitation and electronic commerce, Dr. Cosgrove-Sacks said that there was clearly a difference between the two, and that the point she had made was that there was only a limited value in speeding up the process by which goods were ordered (by means of electronic commerce) if the delivery of products still took an inordinately long time to reach their destination on account of various barriers, notably non-tariff barriers. This was the reason why electronic commerce highlighted the urgency of facilitating trade flows, and explained why there was a fundamental link between the two concepts. Referring to the question raised by the representative of Panama about the work done by UN/ECE in facilitating the reengineering of business processes, Dr. Cosgrove-Sacks said that UN/CEFACT was working closely with the delivery mechanisms of technical assistance and capacity building to help developing countries and major enterprises to understand what needed to be done. At the same time, it was necessary for governments around the world to had to consider the implications of electronic commerce. She cited the example of Switzerland, where had government initiated a process in order to raise awareness of electronic commerce at all levels of business, to enable Switzerland to take a strategic advantage in electronic commerce. She also cited the government procurement services of the United States, which used United Nations rules for Electronic Data Interchange for Administration, Commerce and Transport procedures in their activities. She urged delegations to make contact with UN/CEFACT if they wished further information regarding assistance activities in trade facilitation.","WTCOMTDM25.pdf","Cosgrove-Sacks, UN/ECE, UN/ECE, UN, UNCTAD, ITC, Mexico, Cosgrove-Sacks, Panama, UN/ECE, Cosgrove-Sacks, Switzerland, Switzerland, United, States, United, Nations, Electronic, Data, Interchange, for, Administration, Commerce, and, Transport"

She said that since the informal consultations of 5 May 1999, no additional comments had been received from any Member. The compilation of points therefore, remained unchanged from when Members last discussed the paper on 5 May 1999. She remained convinced that the compilation of points provides a good basis for finalising the contribution of the CTD to the General Council in fulfilment of the Terms of Reference for the CTD on the WTO Work Programme on Electronic Commerce.

The representative of the United States said her delegation were curious to know why the first item of the issues paper regarding points raised in the CTD contained a reference to Article XX. She also noted that paragraph 19 contained a reference to the handling of domain names by the ITU, whereas it was her understanding that domain names were being handled by WIPO.","WTCOMTDM25.pdf","United, States, CTD, ITU, WIPO"
"2091",2091,"73","73.      The representative of Panama said the compilation was useful and could be used as a proper guide to future discussions on the matter of electronic commerce. He drew attention to paragraph 9 of the compilation which stated that ""the essential nature of electronic commerce and cyberspace would make moot the issue of Movement of Natural Persons"", and said that while this was true to some aspects of business transactions, notably processes which could be handled through electronic means, that these were only a limited part of the activities of the firm. It was possible that even though a firm                                                                                        WT/COMTD/M/25                                                                                               Page 17 conducted its work by electronic means, it could also have offices in a number of countries, which would require staff travel, thus ensuring that Movement of Natural Persons remained relevant. He said that the question of Movement of Natural Persons was also relevant to the point made in paragraph 13 of the compilation regarding the training of human resources, as this could require that an office transfer staff from one office to another for training purposes. Regarding paragraphs 15 and 16, he said that the policies and regulations adopted by developed countries affected the development of electronic commerce at the world level. He cited as examples certain export controls on technology, and certain prohibitions on information exports if certain confidentiality requirements are not met. Such policies could have a tremendous impact on the transfer of information and the conduct of business by electronic means across frontiers. Regarding paragraph 18, and the principle of avoiding duplication in the work conducted by international institutions, he said that that in the exercise of avoiding duplication of effort, care must be taken to devote sufficient resources to covering the existing needs of developing countries. Regarding paragraph 49, he noted that it was not simply access prices to the Internet that were an important obstacle, but also the initial costs of securing a presence that would provide access to the Internet highways. It would be useful to have an exchange of ideas regarding the various methods being developed to increase access to electronic networks. Finally, he noted that there were some further barriers to the development of electronic commerce, such as legal systems which established monopolies or closed markets, such as telecommunications or the ticketing systems of airline seats.","WTCOMTDM25.pdf","Panama, Movement, of, Natural, Persons, Movement, of, Natural, Persons"
"2092",2092,"74","74.     The representative of Uruguay drew the attention of the CTD to paragraph 19, and said that at the last informal meeting, his delegation had suggested inserting the phrase ""legal issues in UNCITRAL"", given that UNCITRAL was the organisation that had first dealt with these issues. Also in connection with paragraph 19, he said that Domain Names were the concern of WIPO and not ITU. Third, he questioned the inclusion of the section on points made in the seminar. Finally, he said that delegations were still awaiting the document mentioned in paragraph 43 of the Secretariat Paper WT/COMTD/W/51, regarding the economic implications of electronic commerce. He recalled that at the end of 1998, his delegation had requested the circulation and discussion of the document in the CTD, and that request had been reiterated in the meeting of 2 March 1999, with the support of the EC, India, Hong Kong, China; Cuba, and others. He said that since the document was mentioned in the Secretariat paper, delegations had the right to read it. He therefore reiterated the request he had made Finally, regarding the format of the report to the General Council, he wished to know whether the report would consist of a list of points or whether a more substantive report would be prepared.","WTCOMTDM25.pdf","Uruguay, CTD, UNCITRAL, UNCITRAL, WIPO, ITU, Secretariat, CTD, EC, India, Hong, Kong, China, Cuba, Secretariat, General, Council"
"2093",2093,"75","75.       The representative of Brazil recalled that his delegation had expressed the view that the compilation of points was difficult to work with, and that it suffered from inadequacies in terms both of format and content. His delegation had been expecting major changes to the document, but these had not materialised. He recalled that his delegation, and several others, had requested that the points raised in the seminar be struck out. His delegation had agreed to the holding of the seminar on the understanding that this was a separate initiative with no linkage to the work of the CTD, and saw no utility in attaching the list of points raised in the seminar in this or any other document reporting to the General Council on the work programme on electronic commerce. Regarding the points raised in the CTD, he understood that while there was a disclaimer at the start of the document that the points compiled do not necessarily reflect agreed positions, his reading of the document led him to believe the compilation did not reflect views expressed. For instance, regarding paragraph 2, he said that while some delegations had indeed argued that stronger organic links and a more coordinated approach should be established among the areas of WTO competence, others had argued that this was premature. This view, however, was not reflected in the paper, and it was possible that an uninformed reader could gather the impression that there existed an emerging consensus on the points made in paragraph 2. In paragraph 3, it was stated that aspects of electronic commerce were relevant under a number of Agreements in the WTO, including the Agreement on Government Procurement and ITA-I and II. While some delegations had argued in that such agreements were of relevance, others had argued to the contrary. These views, however, were not reflected. Regarding paragraph 6, while some WT/COMTD/M/25 Page 18 delegations had indeed argued that the growth of electronic commerce raised important trade policy and trade facilitation issues, others had argued that trade facilitation had no bearing on the discussions of electronic commerce. Regarding paragraph 9, some delegations had argued that electronic commerce would make moot the question of the movement of natural persons, while others had argued to the contrary, but this was not reflected in the compilation. Regarding paragraph 23, which stated that investment in infrastructure will be encouraged through regimes that guarantee non-discriminatory treatment among investment, he said that there were no relevant WTO disciplines in this domain. Regarding paragraph 24, while some delegations had argued in favour of low or zero-duty access for computer and telecommunications equipment, others had argued that this was a question of national policy and that members had the right to determine access, but that this was not reflected in the compilation. The representative of Brazil said that he could make similar points in regard to all the paragraphs of the report. While he did not disagree with the content of the compilation of points, he said that different views had been expressed in the course of the CTD discussions, and that this balance was not reflected in the compilation of points. It was therefore difficult to use the compilation of points, as it stood, as a basis for a report to the General Council. Given that there was a time constraint, he suggested that a factual report be prepared which would report that discussions had been held in the CTD, and simply state the main headings listed in the compilation of points. He added that he was also open to the Chairperson submitting a report, on her own responsibility, to the General Council.","WTCOMTDM25.pdf","Brazil, CTD, General, Council, CTD, WTO, WTO, WTO, Brazil, CTD, General, Council, CTD, Chairperson, General, Council"
"2094",2094,"76","76.      The representative of Egypt said his delegation associated itself with the statement made by Brazil, adding that his delegation shared the views expressed by Brazil, Uruguay and Panama. He said that the paper was useful as a compilation, but that its utility was limited to that. The paper should be an evolving document which included the statements, remarks and concerns of different delegations. In addition to the points the representative of Brazil had cited as examples where the balance of views needed to be more adequately reflected, the representative of Egypt drew the attention of the CTD to the following points. Regarding paragraph 4, he considered the use of the word ""phenomenon"" in connection with electronic commerce to be strange, though he agreed that electronic commerce was here to stay. The main issue was to ensure that developing countries could participate effectively in electronic commerce. It was important to identify different concerns and conditions to allow this. Regarding paragraph 5, he shared the view that electronic commerce had positive effects on growth and development, but was concerned that if developing countries were not able to participate in electronic commerce in an effective manner, this could affect their participation in international trade. Regarding the question of movement of natural persons addressed in paragraphs 8 and 9, his delegation were of the view that electronic commerce should not be used as an excuse to avoid further liberalisation in the area of movement of natural persons, or as a substitute for such liberalisation. Regarding paragraph 12, his delegation believed that there were various aspects to infrastructure investment, and that this was not limited to the private sector. The use of public funds, development assistance requirements, and other elements, should not be ignored. Regarding the section on constraints faced by developing countries, it was important to refer to some of the innovative ways in which developing countries have addressed these constraints. Regarding paragraph 17, he said that the role of government need not be minimal, pointing to the issue of taxation as one where the government had an important role. He added that one often spoke of the right macroeconomic framework, but not necessarily about hospitable policy environments, and that there was a need to refine some of the aspects refered to in this regard, and a need for more precise language. Regarding paragraph 19, he said reference needed to be made to the role of the ITC and UNCTAD. Regarding paragraph 23, he said his delegation participated in the working group on trade and investment, and that the determinants of foreign investment and where foreign investment goes are more complex than reflected by the paragraph. His delegation believed this paragraph was one where more balance could be introduced, along with details regarding various aspects of the determinants of foreign investment. Regarding paragraph 24, his delegation shared the views expressed by Brazil that low or zero duty access, was not the only solution to the questions addressed in paragraph 24. The questions raised in the illustrative list were important and pertinent, and that the                                                                                     WT/COMTD/M/25                                                                                            Page 19 Secretariat should complement the paper prepared earlier on electronic commerce with an analytical paper that would attempt to respond to some of the questions. He noted that, in particular, questions 34 to 39 and 41 to 43, were important questions that could form the basis of a future paper by the Secretariat. Regarding paragraph 31, he said that the issues of infrastructure and technical assistance should be separated. Regarding paragraph 33, he said that reference to ""unrestricted, unregulated electronic commerce"" was too sweeping, since some elements of electronic commerce had implications which affected health, safety and other matters where regulations and restrictions were important. Finally, regarding the seminar, he acknowledged the view expressed by Brazil that the points raised in the seminar should be contained in a separate document, and that his delegation was willing to go along with this proposal. His delegation were nevertheless of the view that the paper on points raised in the seminar should be much more substantial and much more detailed, since there were a number of points raised in the seminar which could be used as inputs for discussions in capitals and for further deliberations by the CTD. He cited the example of the Symposium on Trade Facilitation, following which a document containing papers submitted and statements made by participants was produced, as a possible model. In conclusion, his delegation wished to add another aspect to discussions regarding electronic commerce, in the belief that the issue of electronic commerce required a much more integrated approach was required by international organisations, especially those based in Geneva, along the lines used in connection with issues relating to LDCs. His delegation believed that important work was being conducted by UNCTAD on the development aspects of electronic commerce, and at the ITC regarding the role of the private sector and electronic commerce. The WTO was working on rules and the their implications for electronic commerce, WIPO was addressing various aspects of intellectual property rights in relation to electronic commerce, and ITU is addressing various issues in relation to telecommunications and infrastructure. The presence of all these organisations allowed them to play an important role in an integrated manner in order to ensure that activities are not duplicated, and that some coherence exists in addressing issues connected to electronic commerce. The participation of relevant non-Geneva based organisations, such as UNCITRAL, UNDP and the World Bank, could be investigated.","WTCOMTDM25.pdf","Egypt, Brazil, Brazil, Uruguay, Panama, Brazil, Egypt, CTD, ITC, UNCTAD, Brazil, Secretariat, Secretariat, Brazil, CTD, Trade, Facilitation, Geneva, UNCTAD, ITC, WTO, WIPO, ITU, UNCITRAL, UNDP, World, Bank"
"2095",2095,"77","77.       The representative of Mexico agreed with Brazil that the Agreement on Government Procurement was not a multilateral agreement, and that this would have to be specified in the text, or reference to it removed altogether. He said that the point made by Egypt regarding investment in infrastructure was most important. Mention needed to be made of public investment, in order to bring greater balance to the text. Regarding the illustrative list of questions, he said that mention should be made of the main aspects of development to be addressed in terms of electronic commerce. Regarding paragraph 18, he agreed that greater cooperation between the institutions listed was necessary, adding that greater coordination amongst the institutions was necessary as well, especially in connection with technical assistance. He cited as an example the possibility of cooperation between the WTO and the UNCTAD, given the work undertaken by the latter, especially in connection with human resources. Regarding paragraph 27, he asked what it meant in practice to enhance the role of small and medium enterprises in electronic commerce, and suggested that this would involve technical assistance programmes in connection with UNCTAD. The WTO should examine the experiences of UNCTAD in this field to stimulate greater participation of SMEs in electronic commerce. He noted that there was no specific reference to technical assistance in the illustrative list of questions, and said that technical assistance was important if developing country access to infrastructure was to be improved, and their empowerment in the domain of electronic commerce realised. Finally, he said that the document submitted by the CTD to the General Council should list only comments made in the CTD. He said that it was not relevant to refer to the Seminar, and indeed that any relevant points made in the Seminar had been made before the CTD. Such points included the high price of access to the Internet, the predominance of English, the chain of confidence, the issue of human resources. He agreed with the statements made by Brazil, and said that the format in which the statements were presented should indicate that the statements did not reflect agreed positions.

He said it was important to send a summary that fully reflected points made in the CTD. Given that the CTD had to send a report to the General Council by 30 July, his delegation proposed that a final deadline for written submissions. He said that it was important to include in the submission the points made in the Seminar, since the holding of the seminar was decided by the CTD, and because participants at the seminar were similar to the participants in the CTD. Given the technical nature of electronic commerce, his delegation did not consider the points made in the seminar to be less relevant than points made in the CTD.","WTCOMTDM25.pdf","Korea, CTD, CTD, General, Council, CTD, CTD, CTD"

Regarding paragraph 16, he recalled that his country was not a party to the ITA, and said that his delegation was not of the view that the ITA, and specific commitments under the GATS, could facilitate the access to IT goods and services. His delegation supported the view expressed by Brazil saying that a factual report was needed reflecting the various comments made in the CTD, and supported keeping separate from the document the main points made in the seminar.","WTCOMTDM25.pdf","Argentina, Panama, Brazil, Egypt, Mexico, Uruguay, ITA, ITA, Brazil, CTD"

"2099",2099,"80","80.      The representative of India said that in his view the remarks made by Brazil, Egypt and others regarding the compilation of points were devastating. He identified two types of problems. First, errors of omission, inasmuch as when one view was expressed, the opposing view was not. He said there might be some reason for this, insofar as the inclusion of diametrically opposite views would leave the reader in doubt as to what the view held by the CTD was. He said the truth of the matter may be that the CTD had no view on the matter since it was an evolving and new area. Second, his delegation were also concerned about errors of commission. He refered to paragraph 8 and 9 which dealt with the movement of natural persons, and said that the statement that electronic commerce would make moot the issue of the movement of natural persons had no basis in reality. He cited as an example the high demand for Indian software specialists in the United States and Europe, in connection with the Y2K problem, and the fact that this demand could not be met owing to travel restrictions. It seemed, therefore, that contrary to the statement made in paragraph 9, electronic commerce accentuated the question of the movement of natural persons. It was therefore obvious that the report in its present form was problematic. Possible solutions included a summary by the Chairperson on her own responsibility, or a factual summary.","WTCOMTDM25.pdf","India, Brazil, Egypt, CTD, CTD, United, States, Europe, Chairperson"

The representative of Japan, commenting on the views expressed by Egypt and India, said that the holding of the seminar was useful in educating the CTD, and added that the proposal made to hold a seminar on special and differential treatment was a good one, to which his delegation had a positive attitude. However, the holding of a seminar without any concrete outcome was not very productive; some outcome was necessary, whether the seminar be on electronic commerce or special and differential treatment. He said that one possibility, regarding the seminar on electronic commerce, would be to separate the list of points made in the seminar and present it as an annex to the compilation, adding that it was useful to present a record of points made in the seminar to the General Council. He said his delegation could go along with the comments contained in the compilation, but that if some delegations did feel unsure about comments made, his delegation was willing to be flexible. Echoing the suggestion made by India, he said the compilation could be presented as a Chairperson's summary on her own responsibility, if there was no consensus within the CTD concerning the document.","WTCOMTDM25.pdf","Japan, Egypt, India, CTD, General, Council, India, Chairperson, CTD"

Returning to the section on points made in the Seminar, the representative of Japan said it was a pity that no reference had been made to the work carried out by the WTO's Economic Research and Analysis Division on the impact of electronic commerce on customs tariff revenue, which had been refered to in paragraphs 130 and 131 of Secretariat document WT/COMTD/W/18. He said that the compilation should reproduce the contents of paragraph 131, which stated that ""the study estimated                                                                                      WT/COMTD/M/25                                                                                             Page 21 the customs tariff revenue loss in case all these goods were traded on-line to be US$200 million for developing countries and US$600 million.

The representative of Canada said her delegation was of the view that there had been, within the CTD, very constructive discussions on electronic commerce and development, and that it was important to find a way of reflecting these in the report. Her delegation believed the compilation of points was useful and that provided the list could be revised to incorporate comments from the present Session and the informal consultations of 5 May, it would form an important part of the report. She said that if other delegations thought that these discussions could be reflected in a factual summary, her delegation were willing to show flexibility. Regarding points raised in the seminar, she said the reviews of the seminar had been good and that discussion in the seminar had been interesting, and that it was important that these points remained in the report. Her delegation were flexible as to whether points raised in the seminar should remain part of the list, prefaced by a ""chapeau"" explaining the context of that part of the report, or alternatively, that the points made in the seminar be turned into a separate document altogether. Finally, she said she believed Egypt had made a good point concerning the work of other organisations and the need for coordination, and that mention should be made of this in the report.","WTCOMTDM25.pdf","Canada, CTD, Egypt"

He said that informal discussions had been held, that his delegation had enquired from the Secretariat as to whether any written submissions had been made, and had been of the impression that the paper had been settled and could go forward. Unfortunately, this did not seem to be the case, and he said the question was how to ensure that there would be an input from CTD into the General Council process, adding that it was very important that there be such an input. He did not want to pronounce on how this should be done, the but necessary steps should be taken to have another discussion and another document, with sufficient time to discuss the document. His delegation were willing to discuss substantive points and did not want to prejudge any question which had been raised. It was important that there be a faithful reflection of what had been done in the committee. He expressed concern about the time frame for the completion of work and said his delegation were open to suggestions from the chair and the Secretariat on how to proceed.","WTCOMTDM25.pdf","European, Commission, Korea, Secretariat, CTD, General, Council, Secretariat"

"2105",2105,"86","86.      The representative of the United States thanked the Chairperson for her swift response. She said that her delegation agreed with comments made by Japan and Korea, that the list of points made in the seminar be retained in some shape or form, not necessarily as a submission to the General Council but perhaps as an annex. She agreed with Egypt that there were several items discussed in the seminar that would be useful for discussion in the CTD, recalling that the seminar had been initiated by the CTD, that there had been substantial input into the seminar from delegations, and that the representation at the seminar had been quite formidable. A broad spectrum of views had been expressed, and therefore she did not understand why the list of points made in the seminar should be treated as if it contained something repugnant. She recognised that there should be a distinction between statements made by Members and those made by individuals in the Seminar.","WTCOMTDM25.pdf","United, States, Chairperson, Japan, Korea, General, Council, Egypt, CTD, CTD, Members"
"2106",2106,"87","87.     Concerning objections made to the list of points made in the CTD, the representative of the United States said many delegations had raised the need for the list to reflect views not in agreement with the views already contained in the list. She said that objections to specific statements should be WT/COMTD/M/25 Page 22 included, though the statements should not be deleted, in recognition of the fact that the statements reflected views held by delegations. Regarding the points made by Mexico concerning technical assistance, she drew the attention of the CTD to the paper her delegation had circulated earlier, which contained a section on development, and which stated that, in addition to initiatives such as the ITA and basic telecommunication, the United States suggested that Members consider development assistance initiatives that fostered the growth of infrastructure, access to information technology and technical know-how. She therefore requested that the United States notation be included in the revision of the list. Regarding the comments made by India, she said that it was an Indian representative who had said during the Seminar that the question of the movement of natural persons may be minimal.","WTCOMTDM25.pdf","CTD, United, States, Mexico, CTD, ITA, United, States, Members, United, States, India"

The representative of Venezuela supported the delegations of Brazil and Egypt in search of a more balanced text, adding that her delegation found it difficult to take on board paragraphs 3, 7, 23, and 24. In particular, she recalled that her delegation had stated a very definite position concerning public policy in investment matters. Her delegation wished to support the Uruguayan proposal to extract from the compilation all points made in the seminar. This did not negate the value of the seminar, and her delegation were willing to show flexibility in searching for a means to reflect the seminar. She believed that the opinions stated by some delegations, notably Egypt and Brazil, were of sufficient importance for there to flexibility regarding time-frames for the presentation of written comments. She suggested an informal approach be taken that would allow substantive modifications to the documents. she also asked whether the representative of Japan could repeat his proposal, which she had not fully understood.","WTCOMTDM25.pdf","Venezuela, Brazil, Egypt, Egypt, Brazil, Japan"

The preliminary report had not yet been considered by the General Council, but would be on 15 June 1999. Therefore the compilation of points under discussion would form the basis for the definitive submission to the general Council for consideration by 31 July 1999. He said that there was therefore two months for the definitive report to be finalised by the CTD. If this was so, his delegation did not see why there should be a hurry to consider something as definitive when there were two months left at the disposal of the CTD.","WTCOMTDM25.pdf","Uruguay, General, Council, General, Council, CTD, CTD"

She recalled that the points contained in the compilation were neither negotiated nor reflected consensus. Taking into account all that had been said, she said she would endeavour to find a date that would be convenient for all in order to have further informal consultations, prior to the next CTD meeting scheduled for 7 July 1999. In the meantime, the Secretariat would take into account statements made during the meeting and revise the document accordingly. It was hoped that the this would be done in time for the informal consultations, which would be the last meeting during which there would be further discussion on the question, which would be the submitted to the CTD at its meeting of 7 July, during which a definite decision would have to be taken, if it was intended that the contribution of the CTD to the General Council be made by the end of July, as had been planned. She hoped that Members would be agreeable to this proposal, and said that in the meantime she would address a letter, in her capacity as chairperson of the CTD, to the chairman of the General Council, informing him that the question of                                                                                   WT/COMTD/M/25                                                                                          Page 23 electronic commerce continued to be discussed in the CTD.

"2114",2114,"94","94.      The Chairperson said that a number of WTO technical assistance activities were undertaken as part of a programme or of a framework jointly with other organizations. Examples of this were the Joint Integrated Technical Assistance Programme for Selected Least-Developed and Other African Countries (JITAP); and activities undertaken by the WTO in the least-developed countries under the umbrella of the Integrated Framework for Trade-Related Technical Assistance to Least-Developed Countries, outcome of the High Level Meeting for Least-Developed Countries which was held in October 1997. She said that JITAP was a joint programme between ITC, UNCTAD and the WTO, while the Integrated Framework was a coordination mechanism which coordinates trade-related assistance activities in least-developed countries of six agencies: ITC, IMF, UNCTAD, UNDP, the World Bank and WTO. She was sure that while all delegations had heard about these two initiatives, it had seemed to her that there was a general interest among delegations to receive more information about them. Moreover, the initiatives also involved bilateral development partners, which added an additional reason to taking up these two initiatives in the Committee.","WTCOMTDM25.pdf","Chairperson, WTO, Joint, Integrated, Technical, Assistance, Programme, WTO, Integrated, Framework, for, Trade-Related, Technical, Assistance, ITC, UNCTAD, WTO, ITC, IMF, UNCTAD, UNDP, World, Bank, WTO, Committee"

This would be followed by a presentation on the Integrated Framework for Trade-Related Technical Assistance to Least-Developed Countries by Mr. Francesco Geoffroy, of the Administrative Unit of the Integrated Framework. The Administrative Unit represented the six agencies involved: and was located in the ITC. The presentations would help to explain the linkage between the Integrated Framework and JITAP.","WTCOMTDM25.pdf","Dagata, Director, Division, of, Technical, Cooperation, Coordination, Africa, Ben, Fadhl, Africa, International, Trade, Centre, Integrated, Framework, for, Trade-Related, Technical, Assistance, Francesco, Geoffroy, Administrative, Unit, Integrated, Framework, Administrative, Unit, ITC"
"2116",2116,"96","96.     Mr. Dagata said that JITAP was the joint WTO/UNCTAD/ITC Integrated Technical Assistance Programme in Selected Least Developed and Other African countries. He said his presentation would try to shed light on JITAP's origins; its programme concepts and elements; its management and implementation modalities; and its relationship to the Integrated Framework for Trade-related assistance to LDCs. JITAP was concerned with technical cooperation for trade development, aimed at enhancing the participation of African countries in the multilateral trading system. JITAP was broad in scope, covering upstream policy and downstream practical solutions to country needs. Yet it was limited to meeting the most critical needs for trade-related technical WT/COMTD/M/25 Page 24 assistance. It was country-based, with inter-country linkages. It depended on partnerships, among the three Geneva-based institutions, with and among eight African countries, and with 13 donor countries. The participating countries were Tunisia, Uganda, Kenya, Tanzania, Benin, Ghana, Côte d'Ivoire and Burkina Faso. Four of these countries were least-developed countries. Its rationale was to help African countries benefit from the Uruguay Round Agreements. On the occasion of UNCTAD IX, in 1996, the three agencies announced their intention to jointly respond to African needs with integrated activities in selected countries. By end-1997, teams of Geneva-based technical staff, working closely with African national officials, had carried out needs assessments and designed individual projects with the eight participant countries. It became clear that critical country-level needs were predominantly common and that the programme response in each of the countries was becoming a common set of activities. When the prospect of pooling donor resources became evident and the benefits of simultaneous implementation were considered, individual country projects were transformed into the JITAP programme. Implementation had begun in 1998.","WTCOMTDM25.pdf","Dagata, WTO/UNCTAD/ITC, Integrated, Technical, Assistance, Programme, JITAP, Tunisia, Uganda, Kenya, Tanzania, Benin, Ghana, Burkina, Faso, Uruguay, UNCTAD"
"2117",2117,"97","97.       Mr. Dagata said that needs identified during country assessments fell under four headings: first, the need to understand the implications of the new multilateral trading system for Africa's trade; second, the need for help in implementing WTO membership obligations and other undertakings; third, help in identifying new trade opportunities and potential problems for enterprises. And finally, a need to help exporters and importers respond to those opportunities and concerns. JITAP was first and foremost a capacity-building programme. Its distinctive features were joint participation of the three Geneva organisations; a single, or generic, programme with selected activities to address critical common needs, based on individual country needs and responses; organisation of scores of implementation actions in clusters of programme elements, with each cluster covering all partner countries, allowing for the simultaneous implementation across all eight countries, cluster-by-cluster; and finally a communication and discussion facility to facilitate networking among partner countries and between them and the Geneva organisations. This system, once in place, would greatly facilitate implementation and should easily be extended to other organisations. The distinctive features of JITAP contributed to enhancing synergies among partner countries and the Geneva organisations, as well as among programme activities; the use of resources through economies of scale in management and programme implementation; sustainability through networking and other capacity-building features; and replicability of the JITAP programme in other countries if and when it were decided to expand the programme.","WTCOMTDM25.pdf","Dagata, Africa, WTO, Geneva, JITAP"
"2118",2118,"98","98.     Mr. Dagata said that coordination at the national level was through a steering group of involved institutions, donors and the three Geneva organisations. A senior official in the trade ministry was the focal point. Financial contributions for JITAP were brought together in a Common Trust Fund (CTF) administered by the ITC. Window One received unearmarked contributions, and Window Two for country-earmarked contributions. The total cost of the programme in the eight countries was estimated at US$10 million. Contributions to date were well over US$8 million; the funding gap was mainly in Kenya, and to a lesser extent in Côte d'Ivoire. There was a broad donor base, with 13 donors, including Côte d'Ivoire itself which had pledged to make a substantial contribution to the CTF for its own activities.","WTCOMTDM25.pdf","Dagata, Geneva, ITC, Kenya, CTF"
"2119",2119,"99","99.      Mr. Vijay said he would describe the programme content of JITAP and explain how the clusters that reflected that content had been set up to realise the three objectives of the programmes, namely building knowledge of the multilateral trading system; conforming to the multilateral trading system; and enhancing the readiness of the country's exporters to take advantage of opportunities offered by a liberalised economy. As explained earlier the technical work undertaken by the three organisations during the programming phase led to the identification of a number of activities that needed to be undertaken to realise the three objectives of the programme. During the programming phase, it was found that to optimise the use of resources and to derive synergy and economies of scale benefits, the activities were best undertaken in groups. This led to the adoption of a cluster approach. Groups of generic activities were called clusters. These generic activities or clusters were undertaken                                                                                    WT/COMTD/M/25                                                                                           Page 25 to satisfy the identified needs of each country. In each cluster, there were sufficient commonalities across the countries to allow for simultaneous delivery of a number of outputs in a group of countries. By using this approach, it was possible to undertake scores of activities involving over 1,000 implementation actions in eight countries through 15 clusters. The 15 clusters were best understood in terms of four families and could be classified as follows: knowledge of the MTS and its implications; reforms to meet MTS obligations; enterprise readiness; and support.","WTCOMTDM25.pdf","Vijay, MTS, MTS"

"2125",2125,"10","10.       Mr. Burki said that the World Bank focussed, in the paper, on the changing role of official aid flows, and what the World Bank could do to help small states in this context. He identified ten issues that were of interest to the World Bank, which were discussed in the paper, and which informed the World Bank's approach to the problems faced by small states. First, experience had indicated that good policies, when combined aid, led to a higher rate of economic growth, by as much as two percentage points according to empirical evidence. Second, improved aid flows enhanced the credit-worthiness of small states. This was an exceptionally important point, as the increasing importance of private capital flows increased the importance of credit worthiness. Third, international institutions, and particularly development banks, should take into account not only GDP but also the volatility and vulnerability of income in determining graduation thresholds and other policies. The World Bank urged international institutions to make use of the Vulnerability Index devised by the Commonwealth Secretariat, in order to formulate judgements about appropriate thresholds. Fourth, it was appropriate for the World Bank and other multilateral development banks to focus on the quality of the entire public expenditure programme, and not only on specific projects in order to derive the maximum benefit from aid flows. Fifth, it was the view of the World Bank that, given the low absorptive capacity of small states, better coordination would minimise demands placed by the donor community on the administrations of small states; this coordination could take place within a framework that identified the needs of small states and took account of the comparative advantages of the various institutions working to help small states improve their development prospects. Sixth, the World Bank had had good experiences with private executing agencies in the execution of projects financed by foreign assistance, particularly in countries where official institutions could not meet the demands placed on them by foreign aid agencies. Seventh, the World Bank had emphasised the need to promote regional institutions within which small states could work in order to realise economies of scale. There was good empirical evidence to indicate that where regional institutions had been effectively set up, these had improved performances in terms of aid utilisation. Eighth, it was the intention of the World Bank to use a proportion of the assistance it provided in order to reduce risk and vulnerability. This would involve a number of new innovations which had been undertaken as a result of the setting up of the Joint Task Force. Ninth, in at least one operation, the World Bank had provided contingent lines of financial assistance which could be tapped by small states in the event of natural disasters. Tenth, it was necessary for small states to restructure their economies. In order to do so, significant investment was needed in the development of human resources. It was necessary for the donor community to refocus its aid and technical assistance programmes towards the improvement of human resources.","WTCOMTDM26.pdf","Burki, World, Bank, World, Bank, World, Bank, World, Bank, World, Bank, Commonwealth, Secretariat, World, Bank, World, Bank, World, Bank, World, Bank, World, Bank, Joint, Task, Force, World, Bank"
"2126",2126,"100","100.    The representative of Brazil said the surplus alluded to by Japan was illusory and transient in nature. He said that the increased financing of assistance through the regular budget would entail increased contribution by all Members. He recalled that a number of developing countries already were in arrears in regard to the payment of their contribution to the WTO, and that the Budget Committee had been engaged in work relating to the threshold for minimum contributions to the WTO in order to lessen the burden on developing countries. He agreed with Japan that forthcoming trade negotiations would place additional burdens on the human resources of the Secretariat, as well as on developing country delegations. He said that as a number of new trade issues were not asked for by developing, but rather developed, members, developing Members should not be asked to share equally in the cost of providing technical assistance. He said that there was a differentiated responsibility between groups of Members regarding the provision of technical assistance. Regarding solutions to the funding crisis, he said that it followed from what he had just said that his delegation would have reservations regarding the proposal to fund technical assistance entirely through the budget. Alternatives which attracted the sympathy of his delegation were the possibility of voluntary contributions from donors, or increased cooperation with other organisations.

The representative of Senegal said that Brazil had made a number of relevant points, but that these concerned modalities and procedure, whereas it was important in the immediate to secure agreement the principle of funding technical assistance through the regular budget. He noted that many Members shared the point of view of his delegation that technical assistance was not getting the financial support that it was rightfully due. This was contrary to the commitments made by Members and to the principle of solidarity between Members. He recalled that technical assistance was beneficial to developing countries, but also developed country members, since the latter would benefit from the development of their trading partners. He clarified that his delegation did not seek to organise a one-off seminar on technical assistance, but rather to hold on an annual basis a day of reflection on all aspects of technical assistance. He thanked Canada for its support in this respect.","WTCOMTDM26.pdf","Senegal, Brazil, Members, Members, Members, Canada"

She said that New Zealand, as a developed Member and a donor, had gained much from the contributions it had made towards technical assistance projects, especially from those that had targeted to countries in the Asia-Pacific region. She echoed the point made by Switzerland that there was consensus as to the nature of the problem faced, and that it was necessary to seek solutions. She said that the proposal by Senegal to hold a day of reflection on technical assistance was a useful first step, and she encouraged the Secretariat to examine whether this could be taken up in the near future. Her delegation also welcomed the establishment of the GTF.","WTCOMTDM26.pdf","New, Zealand, Egypt, Senegal, Haiti, Namibia, Senegal, Members, New, Zealand, Member, Asia-Pacific, Switzerland, Senegal, Secretariat"

Regarding the question of outsourcing, he said that the point his delegation had wished to make was that in the experience of Namibia, the outsourcing of technical assistance activities had usually not been productive in terms of the delivery of effective technical assistance. He added that the difficulties faced in delivering technical assistance needed to be addressed in a systemic way.","WTCOMTDM26.pdf","Namibia, Namibia"

She said that following the discussion held in the 25th Session of the CTD, she had addressed a letter to the Chairperson of the Budget Committee, and that both committees were liasing with each other in order to set a convenient date on which to hold an extraordinary session devoted to the financial crisis affecting technical assistance.

"2131",2131,"105","105.     The Chairperson recalled that by decision of the CTD at its 22nd Session on 2 November 1998, the Secretariat was requested to prepare a Background Note compiling information on the difficulties, if any, that members may have experienced either in the implementation of these                                                                                     WT/COMTD/M/26                                                                                            Page 23 provisions and/or in making use of these provisions. The Secretariat had circulated a questionnaire on 12 November to members in order to collect the information required for the preparation of the document. As of the 25th Session of the CTD on 4 June, a mere five delegations had provided responses to the questionnaire, a number which subsequently rose to six when the delegation of Australia submitted its response. The Secretariat had also been making use of information available within the Secretariat. She informed the CTD that, as indicated at a previous informal meeting, the Secretariat had put together a first draft document based on the information supplied by delegations and collected form Secretariat sources. It had been circulated as a draft document (initially in English only). The Chairperson invited Mr. Tulloch, Director, Development Division, to present the draft report.","WTCOMTDM26.pdf","Chairperson, CTD, Secretariat, Secretariat, CTD, Australia, Secretariat, Secretariat, CTD, Secretariat, Secretariat, Chairperson, Tulloch, Director, Development, Division"
"2132",2132,"106","106.     Mr. Tulloch apologised for the late circulation of the draft document, and said he hoped that Members had some initial comments to make. He recalled that it had been agreed in the CTD that the Secretariat would do two things. First, it was to compile and analyse answers to questionnaires circulated to Members concerning difficulties, if any, in the implementation of provisions for special and differential treatment. Second, it was to analyse information already available in the Secretariat. He said that the draft document was the first result of the Secretariat's efforts, and said that the note had two parts. The first presented the information provided by the six Members that had responded to the questionnaire circulated in November 1998. It had not been possible to conduct any meaningful analysis, given the low level of replies. The second part compiled information available in the various WTO bodies that were responsible for the administration of the different WTO Agreements. The section included statements made by members in the Trade Policies Review Body, the review process of the Dispute Settlement Understanding, and in the different councils and committees of the WTO. As requested by members the Note focused on the statements made concerning the implementation of special and differential provisions, rather than broader implementation concerns. Where statements on special and differential provisions were tied in with broader concerns regarding implementation, these concerns were presented under the heading ""General Comments"" at the start of each section. He said that the document as a whole provided a picture of the genuine concerns that Members had regarding the implementation of special and differential provisions. He reiterated that the document was being circulated in draft form, with a view to completing it in the light of comments made in the committee.","WTCOMTDM26.pdf","Tulloch, Members, CTD, Secretariat, Members, Secretariat, Secretariat, Members, WTO, WTO, WTO, Members"
"2133",2133,"107","107.     The representative of Brazil said he would make some preliminary and limited comments. He said that the broader the approach taken by the paper, the better, and that even if broad concerns were not related to specific special and differential provisions, the should still be included, perhaps in a different category. Regarding the section on responses to questionnaires, he said his delegation had never been optimistic about the level of responses to the questionnaires, since many developing country delegations were over-burdened with work owing to the preparatory process for the Ministerial Conference. The representative of Brazil said that the stage had been reached where the CTD could profit from discussions held in the General Council Special Sessions. During these a number of proposals had been tabled that covered agreements regarding which information was presented in the draft document, though no reference had been made to the proposals. This was not surprising as the material contained in the proposals presented tot he General Council was not available in specific committees. He said that committees such as the respective committees on anti- dumping, safeguards and subsidies had limited their work to operational and house-keeping exercises, without there being much debate or work of any analytical nature. His delegation did not believe that the Secretariat need limit the circulation of the document in order to take into account the proposals made to the General Council; such work could be done subsequently and separately.","WTCOMTDM26.pdf","Brazil, Brazil, CTD, General, Council, Special, Sessions, General, Council, Secretariat, General, Council"

The representative of Uruguay said his delegation regretted that his delegation had not had time to study the document in detail, and added that the document would be forwarded to his capital, and that his delegation would provide further comments at a later date. Referring to page 13 of the document and the section on agriculture, he said that while there may not have been any statement WT/COMTD/M/26 Page 24 made in the Committee on Agriculture regarding special and differential treatment, one submission at least had been made - by Australia - to the General Council as part of the preparatory process. The delegation of Uruguay supported this proposal, along with other Members belonging to the Cairns Group of countries. He wished to know whether only information available in subsidiary bodies was going to be taken into account, or whether the number of proposals submitted to the General Council would also be considered.","WTCOMTDM26.pdf","Uruguay, Committee, on, Agriculture, Australia, General, Council, Uruguay, Members, Cairns, Group, General, Council"
"2135",2135,"109","109.    The representative of the European Communities said that the mandate given to the secretariat was to examine the work conducted by subsidiary bodies, and expressed the unease of his delegation regarding the suggestion that proposals submitted to the General Council be examined. He said that such an examination would be carried out in any case elsewhere, and that the exercise conducted by the CTD was of a factual nature, and should therefore avoid entering into the more political debate that occurred in the General Council.","WTCOMTDM26.pdf","European, Communities, General, Council, CTD, General, Council"

"2139",2139,"112","112.    Mr. Tulloch thanked Members for their preliminary comments, and said he would appreciate receiving further comments. Referring to the point made by Brazil regarding the General Council process, and also the view expressed by the European Communities in this regard, Mr. Tulloch said that such considerations had been carefully weighed in the preparation of the document, and that the decision had been made not to consider the proposals made in the General Council Special Sessions, given that this was an on-going process. He said that information on special and differential provisions contained in subsidiary bodies had highlighted issued similar to those raised in the General Council, with the exception of the Agreement on Agriculture, regarding which he shared the surprise expressed by the delegation of Uruguay that no statement had been made.. Mr. Tulloch requested that Members provide their views on whether the CTD should conduct some work regarding the proposals submitted to the General Council as a supplement to the work it had already initiated on the implementation difficulties of provisions for special and differential treatment.

It was agreed that the Secretariat would prepare an Informal Note on the Committee's possible input into the Seattle Ministerial Conference, reflecting the discussions held. This note was duly prepared and circulated to Members on 22 June 1999 as Job No.3578. The Chairperson invited delegates to comment on this paper, and to provide further thoughts regarding possible inputs for the Seattle Ministerial Conference.","WTCOMTDM26.pdf","Chairperson, CTD, Secretariat, Committee, Seattle, Ministerial, Conference, Members, Chairperson, Seattle, Ministerial, Conference"
"2141",2141,"114","114.    The representative of Brazil recalled that in the last meeting his delegation had expressed concern about the way in which the CTD could contribute to the discussion held in the General Council regarding the preparatory process for the third Ministerial Conference. He said that several Members envisaged that the third Ministerial Council would create new rights and obligations for Members and added that Brazil did not necessarily wish to dissociate itself with this view. He said that on the basis of the experience of implementation of Uruguay Round Agreements and of the special and differential provisions contained therein, the expectation of Brazil had been frustrated in                                                                                      WT/COMTD/M/26                                                                                             Page 25 several areas. He said that in the first instance, those special and differential provisions which were of a temporary nature, and which were due to expire, had proved to be insufficient to address the structural problems of developing countries. Furthermore, a number of special and differential provisions were limited to best endeavour clauses, which were often not observed. There was also the question of the interpretation of special and differential provisions in the context of dispute settlement procedures. Very often, such provisions were considered to be exceptions to the rules, and the burden of proof often fell on developing countries to justify recourse to such provisions. All these deficiencies needed to be addressed.","WTCOMTDM26.pdf","Brazil, CTD, General, Council, Members, Ministerial, Council, Members, Brazil, Uruguay, Brazil"
"2142",2142,"115","115.     Brazil had two objectives: first to ensure that the imbalances of the Uruguay Round were corrected, and second, to avoid a situation in which any new rights and obligations failed to take into account the development concerns of Members. He said that the CTD had an important role to play and that the contribution of the CTD needed to be effective and directed towards the negotiating process. He said developing countries had difficulty in identifying and protecting their interests. It was necessary to be realistic about the ability of developing countries to engage fully and properly in negotiations, and that care was needed to ensure that developing countries were not left behind in the preparatory process owing to their shortfalls in capacity, and a fragmentation of the preparatory process. He quoted from the Geneva Ministerial Declaration which stated that ""a process (…) be established under the direction of the General Council to ensure full and faithful implementation of existing agreements and to prepare for the Third Session of the Ministerial Conference"". He noted that in a number of subsidiary bodies, there were efforts to speed up the preparatory process, which, though they could be understood, carried the danger that developing country interests would not be reflected at the third Ministerial Conference.","WTCOMTDM26.pdf","Brazil, Uruguay, Round, Members, CTD, CTD, General, Council"
"2143",2143,"116","116.     The representative of Brazil said that it was recognised that the CTD was a special and peculiar body within the structure of the WTO, since its work was, by necessity, of a cross-cutting and horizontal nature, and because it addressed one of the pillars of the organisation, namely the question of development. There were several ways in which work could be conducted within the CTD so as to have an impact on the preparations of the Ministerial, in addition to preparing Members. One way was for Members to use the work of the CTD to develop and present proposals to the General Council, either as individual Members or as clusters of Members. A second way was for a Member to propose that the General Council mandate the CTD to conduct work which would serve as an input to the preparatory process. He recalled that one of the terms of reference of the CTD was to ""review periodically (…) the application of special provisions in the Multilateral Trade Agreements and related Ministerial Decisions in favour of developing country Members, and in particular least- developed country Members, and report to the General Council for appropriate action."". The CTD was thus mandated to consider any question that arose in the application of special and differential provisions. He said that there had been a number of proposals made in the General Council regarding special and differential treatment, but none of these had been discussed, for several reasons. The CTD, however, had the time and the mandate to consider such proposals, and developmental concerns in general, and suggested in this respect that an emphasis could be placed on implementation issues and the built-in agenda. Above all, the focus of the work conducted by the CTD should have as its focus the mainstreaming of development into the WTO. He suggested that on possibility was for the Secretariat to developing a work programme leading to the Ministerial Conference that focussed on analysing and debating the proposals submitted to the General Council which had a bearing on special and differential treatment. Second, it was necessary to examine how best to reflect the work of the CTD in the General Council, and he reiterated his delegation's concerns that the preparatory process would be fragmented if a number of subsidiary bodies made contributions on their own initiative. One possibility would be for the secretariat to prepare a paper based on a compilation of proposals made and discussion held. He acknowledged the concern expressed by the European Communities that the CTD avoid engagement in political debate, and sad that any paper prepared by the Secretariat need be purely factual and not analytical.

The representative of the European Communities said that it was necessary to focus on what was feasible, and recalled in this context that one delegation had suggested that the CTD's contribution needed to be ready by 30 September 1999. He said that there was agreement that the CTD did not have the mandate to present, on its own initiative, recommendations to the special session of the General Council. The CTD could however focus on work under its mandate, and report to the ordinary General Council. In doing so it could signal that the work undertaken was useful background material to the Ministerial Conference, and the General Council could then come to a decision as to whether the work done by the CTD was relevant to the preparatory process. Referring to the Secretariat Note (Job No.3578) and paragraph 4, he said that a point regarding coherence issues in relation to technical assistance should be included.","WTCOMTDM26.pdf","European, Communities, CTD, CTD, General, Council, CTD, General, Council, General, Council, CTD, Secretariat"

He said that the Secretariat Note, Job No.3578 regarding possible inputs to the Ministerial Conference constituted a basis from which proposals could be derived. He said that if the CTD were to follow the work programme and proposals suggested by Brazil, it would be able to contribute in a most effective manner to the preparation of the Ministerial Conference.","WTCOMTDM26.pdf","Pakistan, Brazil, CTD, Pakistan, Secretariat, Secretariat, CTD, Brazil"

The representative of Uruguay said that the Geneva Ministerial Declaration was clear that the preparatory process was under the mandate of the General Council, and that it was important that the process not be fragmented as this would create difficulties for developing countries. He cautioned against advancing at a speed that was greater that that at which the General Council handled the preparatory process. He said that development was a horizontal theme, and supported one of the suggestions made by Brazil that the CTD could solicit from the General Council the mandate to undertake work of a horizontal nature concerning development with a view to making a contribution to the preparatory process for the third Ministerial Conference. He said that above all, the CTD needed ensure that developing countries were well prepared to face forthcoming trade negotiations, and said that his delegation wishes to support what had been said by Brazil in this regard.","WTCOMTDM26.pdf","Uruguay, General, Council, General, Council, Brazil, CTD, General, Council, CTD, Brazil"
"2147",2147,"12","12.      Sir Humphrey Maud said that his remarks were intended to complement those made by Mr. Burki. The initiative to establish the Task Force emerged from the discussions of Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting (CHOGM) in Edinburgh in 1997. At the request of Commonwealth leaders, the Secretary-General of the Commonwealth arranged a five-member, high-level mission to visit key international organisations to discuss the concerns of small states. The mission, held in July 1998, was led by the Prime Minister of Barbados, and included the Deputy Prime Ministers of Lesotho and Mauritius and the Foreign and Trade Ministers of Fiji and New Zealand. During these discussions, the idea of establishing the Task Force was formalised with the World Bank. The WTO, IMF, UNCTAD and the European Commission all agreed to participate in this endeavour. Sir Humphrey emphasised that the focus of the Task Force was on all small states and not merely Commonwealth ones.","WTCOMTDM26.pdf","Humphrey, Maud, Burki, Commonwealth, CHOGM, Edinburgh, Commonwealth, Commonwealth, Barbados, Lesotho, Mauritius, Fiji, New, Zealand, World, Bank, WTO, IMF, UNCTAD, European, Commission, Humphrey"

She said that the CTD had a mandate to fulfil, and added that there was a realisation in the General Council that there was a need to for coordination of work undertaken within the organisation, given that it was difficult for the General Council to comprehensively address all issues across the full range of WTO agreements. Referring to Job No.3578, she said that ideas, recorded in paragraph 4, had been put forward by Members, and that these issues needed to be further discussed. Under paragraph 5, which dealt with the future work programme of the CTD, she said that were the document WT/COMTD/W/31 on the Participation of Developing Countries in International Trade issued in 1997 to be updated, comments made by Members in the CTD when the previous version was discussed needed to be taken into account.","WTCOMTDM26.pdf","Hong, Kong, China, Brazil, CTD, General, Council, General, Council, WTO, Members, CTD, Participation, of, Developing, Countries, in, International, Trade, Members, CTD"
"2149",2149,"121","121.     The representative of the United States said that one detected from the statements made by Brazil, Pakistan and Uruguay, a logical train of thought regarding the role of the CTD in terms of preparations for the Ministerial Conference. There was a certain inevitability in tasking the CTD to undertake certain types of work, on the basis of items that had been tabled in the General Council, aside from the CTD's own mandate. He noted that it had also been pointed out that such work should be undertaken on the basis of an initiative of a Member in the General Council, to ensure the fulfilment of the General Council's role at all times as established by the Geneva Ministerial Declaration. This was the right way of proceeding, especially in light of the resource constraints that affected developing countries. He said that the Secretariat Note, Job No.3578, was somewhat ambiguous as to the role of the General Council, adding that it was somewhat presumptuous in paragraph 4 in referring to the input of the CTD to the Seattle Ministerial Conference, and that it                                                                                    WT/COMTD/M/26                                                                                           Page 27 would perhaps be necessary to reword this statement while a decision was awaited from the General Council.","WTCOMTDM26.pdf","United, States, Brazil, Pakistan, Uruguay, CTD, CTD, General, Council, CTD, Member, General, Council, General, Council, Secretariat, General, Council, CTD, Seattle, Ministerial, Conference, General, Council"

The representative of Egypt said that his delegation wished to support many of the elements contained in the statement made by Brazil, and that these could be incorporated into a work programme that extended to the third Ministerial Conference. He echoed the point made by the European Communities that many of the inputs listed in paragraph 4 of the Secretariat Note, Job No.3578, could be incorporated into the work programme of the CTD. However, it was necessary to bear in mind that the third Ministerial Conference would be held by the end of 1999, and that there was a need for developing country Members to be equipped and have a contribution to make to the Ministerial Conference. He agreed that the chapeau of paragraph 4 was perhaps misleading, as the contribution of the CTD would be to the preparatory process, or for the direct use of delegations, but not directly to the Ministerial Conference.","WTCOMTDM26.pdf","Egypt, Brazil, Secretariat, CTD, Members, CTD"

On one hand, it was being held that the preparatory process should not be fragmented, while on the other hand a mandate was being sought from the General Council for the CTD to undertake work for the preparatory process. He said that while his delegation would not stand in the way of seeking a mandate from the General Council, his delegation would caution against excessive ambition, and notably a situation in which the CTD would take on matters that went beyond its mandate, in particular work that went beyond factual reporting. He noted that the General Council was not due to meet prior to the end of July, and that if a mandate was to be sought from the General Council, no work could be undertaken prior to the end of July. If in the event the mandate given by the General Council to the CTD did not go beyond the CTD's existing mandate, time would have been wasted.","WTCOMTDM26.pdf","European, Communities, General, Council, for, the, CTD, General, Council, CTD, General, Council, General, Council, General, Council, CTD, CTD"

He said that it was appropriate to present an updated version, on account of the third Ministerial Conference, but also because it would be possible to assess the impact of the financial crisis on developing countries. He recalled that WT/COMTD/W/31 covered the period 1991-96. It would be useful if the updated document examined three period of time: first, the very long run from the foundation of the WTO to the present; second the medium term, that is the 1990s as whole; and finally the period surrounding the financial crisis, that is 1996 to 1998/1999. The outline for the paper envisaged five sections. First, a section on long run trends which would largely be structured along the lines of the corresponding section of the Background Paper prepared for the High Level Symposium. Second, a section on data for the 1990's, which could include data on trade by region and product structure, as well as data on south-south trade. A third section would provide a factual account of developments in trade policies and practices in developing and transition economies since the start of the Uruguay Round trade negotiations, using data from Trade Policy reviews and other sources. The fourth section would address the recent financial crisis and its impact on trade, by assessing changes in trade patterns in the period 1997-98 as compared with the period preceding the crisis. This section could examine the trade of developing countries with countries affected by the crisis, and changes in the regional and product structure of trade. The last section would address the participation of least-developed countries in international trade, and provide updated information on the share of least-developed countries in world trade. Measure and initiatives taken at or since the High Level Meeting on Least-Developed Countries could also be examined.","WTCOMTDM26.pdf","Tulloch, Egypt, WTO, Uruguay, Round"

Its policy recommendations were preceded by an in-depth analysis of the needs of small states such as: the graduation policies of international financial institutions; strategies for coping with natural disasters; globalisation and the risk of marginalisation of small states; the problems of transition of small economies from a preferential trading system to a more liberal international trading environment; and vulnerability and the development of a vulnerability index to be used as an additional criterion in determining development assistance to small states.","WTCOMTDM26.pdf","WTO, EC"

The World Bank hosted a conference in St Lucia in February 1999 that was attended by about 125 people, including Prime Ministers and senior ministers as well as a wide cross-section from 25 countries. The main conclusions of the Conference were first, that there was a broad consensus emerged on the need for multilateral lending policies to be adjusted to meet the special needs of small states. Second, on trade issues, small states needed to take advantage of opportunities created by globalisation. But to do so, small states faced high transitional costs in integrating their economies into the global trading system which would require adequate resources. It was necessary for multilateral organisations responsible for the international trade regime to recognise and accommodate the acute vulnerability of many small states which did not fall into the least-developed category. Third, the volatility of lending by international financial institutions to small states was acute and more stable programmes of lending designed to overcome this were needed. Fourth, for small states knowledge and access to it were essential for promoting development. Taking advantage of new technologies in the field of communications, as well as other infrastructure could best be promoted by a regional approach. Fifth, financing mechanisms based on international capital markets were identified for disaster insurance, for elaboration and implementation on a sub-regional basis. Finally, the Commonwealth’s Vulnerability Index provided an operational tool for advancing the case for the special treatment of small and vulnerable states.","WTCOMTDM26.pdf","World, Bank, St, Lucia"
"2163",2163,"15","15.       The Vulnerability Index took into account both the impact of vulnerability as well as the resilience of countries to adverse events. Thus there was a strong case for the WTO to take this into account in discussing trade issues. The first component of the index was based on three indicators: first, the lack of diversification; secondly, the extent of export dependence; and, thirdly, the impact of natural disasters. These were combined to form a composite index of the impact of vulnerability on developing countries. The resulting index was then weighted by GDP, as a proxy for resilience, the second component of the index. The index covered a sample of 111 developing countries, 37 small and 74 large, for which data were available. According to the index, small states were found to be systematically more vulnerable than large countries, regardless of income. The results indicated that of the 25 most vulnerable countries, 24 were small states and of the 50 most vulnerable countries                                                                                    WT/COMTD/M/26                                                                                            Page 5 33 were small states. It was interesting to note that many highly vulnerable countries were also least-developed; for example, half of the 50 most vulnerable countries fell into the least-developed country category.","WTCOMTDM26.pdf","WTO"
"2164",2164,"16","16.      Sir Humphrey said it was the intention of the Commonwealth Secretariat to follow up the implementation of the Task Force recommendations by encouraging all the leading international institutions to develop their action programmes to support small states. This of course included the WTO. The Commonwealth Secretariat and the World Bank believed the WTO could make a key contribution to smoothing the transitional problems of small states. To this end, he advanced four thoughts for the consideration of the WTO for action, which would complement the actions of the Commonwealth Secretariat and the World Bank. First, the WTO needed to recognise that small vulnerable states faced difficult challenges in making the necessary adjustment to multilateral trade liberalisation and achieving a sustainable threshold of development sufficient to free them from dependence on aid and trade preferences. Secondly, procedures for accession to the WTO needed to be streamlined and accelerated. Small states would find it easier to achieve membership if they were afforded financial and expert assistance in the process of accession, which was costly in terms of legal fees and also involved complex negotiations. Thirdly, the single most important development of the Uruguay Round was the creation of the strengthened dispute settlement mechanism. However, the legal costs of using this mechanism were substantial, clearly making it inaccessible for many small states. An arrangement should be established which would assist small states to make use of the mechanism. Finally, using the present formula of 0.03 per cent of world trade as a lower threshold for the membership subscriptions to WTO, meant that the per capita cost of membership was significantly higher for many small states than larger members of the Organisation. Given that small states, in aggregate, accounted for less than one-quarter of one per cent of world trade, there was a strong case for lowering their subscription fees.","WTCOMTDM26.pdf","Humphrey, Commonwealth, Secretariat, WTO, Commonwealth, Secretariat, World, Bank, WTO, WTO, Commonwealth, Secretariat, World, Bank, WTO, WTO, Uruguay, Round, WTO, Organisation"

"2166",2166,"18","18.      The representative of Bolivia thanked Mr. Burki and Sir Humphrey for their presentations. She said that small economies had difficulties in coming to grips with the tentacular nature of the multilateral trading system, with all its implications for small economies. She recalled that Bolivia had worked, in the context of the Geneva Ministerial Conference, towards the introduction of the concept of small economies. While Bolivia did not identify itself with the criteria applied by the Commonwealth Secretariat and the World Bank to define another concept, that of small states, Bolivia did identify itself with a number of the issues raised in the paper, which was itself a useful document that would enable a further examination of issues of interest to small economies. Regarding the ten points discussed by Mr. Burki, she asked whether the point about credit worthiness was not in contradiction with the point on the use of the vulnerability index in determining graduation thresholds. In connection with the point regarding the restructuring of small economies and the need for human development and greater stability, she asked whether the international community had a commitment to work towards greater stability, and whether other countries had demonstrated a will for restructuring, and cited as an example the difficulties encountered in restructuring the market for agricultural products. She said that Bolivia had undertaken extensive efforts in restructuring, and had incurred high social costs in the process, and that Bolivia wished to see an example of restructuring in areas of export interest to it. She said there were, to the contrary, attempts to introduce measures which would slow down the restructuring of such markets, and which caused countries like Bolivia to depend more on preferences. She noted that there had been a reference to the need to facilitate the process of transition which small economies needed to undergo. Transition would be facilitated if there was a systemic response as whole to problems of transition. The simple recourse to ad hoc measures was liable to jeopardise, in the medium term, the establishment of such a comprehensive approach to problems of transition.

The representative of Barbados joined the delegation of Bolivia in welcoming the Task Force, and thanked Mr. Burki and Sir Humphrey for their presentations, notably the presentation of the Vulnerability Index and its relevance to the work of the WTO. She said her delegation was of the view that the draft report presented to the CTD provided very useful material on the vulnerability and other characteristics of small states, on the development challenges faced by small states, and on the strategies and innovative approaches which small states and institutions, including the WTO, could adopt when attempting to address the inherent difficulties faced by small states in regard to participation in the multilateral trading system. She said her delegation had spoken repeatedly on the vulnerability of small economies, on their development problems, and on the difficulties faced by small economies in achieving full integration into the multilateral trading system. It was therefore heartening to hear from the Task Force that the WTO needed to take recognise that small economies faced specific challenges in adjusting to multilateral trade liberalisation. Her delegation wished to endorse the call made by Sir Humphrey that Ministers discuss the issue of small economies in the Third Ministerial Conference, with a view to including the issue of small economies in the WTO work programme. She said that this suggestion should be formally included in the input of the CTD into the preparatory process for the Third Ministerial Conference.","WTCOMTDM26.pdf","Barbados, Bolivia, Burki, Humphrey, WTO, CTD, WTO, WTO, Humphrey, WTO, CTD"

The representative of Haiti thanked Mr. Burki and Sir Humphrey for their presentation, and said that his delegation appreciated the fact that the Commonwealth Secretariat, in its study, did not differentiate between small states and small economies belonging to the Commonwealth, and those that did not. He said that the concept of vulnerability furthered the recognition of the issues faced by small economies. His delegation were nevertheless preoccupied by the manner in which the question of small economies was handled. While the Commonwealth Secretariat and the World Bank spoke of small states, the Ministerial Conference of the WTO had referred to small economies. His delegation hoped that the Secretariat would find the means to develop a definition that would be of satisfaction to the WTO and to the UN system, which would take into account the problems of small economies and notably the concept of vulnerability. This last concept was important given the number of highly developed small states that were Members of the WTO. The representative of Haiti also drew attention to the fact that certain small states, including Haiti, were particularly prone to suffer from natural disasters. Regarding the question of ODA, he recalled that the United Nations had recommended that flows of ODA be not less than 0.7 per cent of GNP, and said that it was therefore the low levels of aid flows from OECD countries was cause for concern. He appealed to the Commonwealth Secretariat to urge those countries that had committed themselves to providing the equivalent of 0.7 per cent of GNP in ODA to adhere to these commitments, to ensure that developing countries, and small economies in particular, received that to which they were entitled. This would in turn make available the necessary funds to address the marginalisation of small economies. Finally, he said that whereas least-developed countries were given recognition, such recognition had not yet been given to small economies. Such recognition was important if small economies were to exercise their rights.","WTCOMTDM26.pdf","Haiti, Burki, Humphrey, Commonwealth, Secretariat, Commonwealth, Commonwealth, Secretariat, World, Bank, WTO, Secretariat, WTO, UN, Members, WTO, Haiti, Haiti, ODA, United, Nations, ODA, OECD, Commonwealth, Secretariat"
"2170",2170,"21","21.      The representative of Guatemala thanked Sir Humphrey and Mr. Burki for their presentation, and said his delegation agreed with many of the matters raised. He noted, however, that Guatemala had a population of over 1.5 million and said that the concept of small states should be broadened. He said that this was not a question of establishing new categories, but rather an exercise in understanding the limitation and constraints affecting small economies, and seeking appropriate mechanisms to ensure that they benefitted fully from participation in international trade. Aspects which were of particular interest to small economies included market access for products of export interest, the transfer of technologies, technical assistance and special and differential treatment. He said that in the process of creation of the Free-Trade Area of the Americas, a consultative group on small economies had been established, in order that the concerns of small economies that were participating in trade negotiations in the region be taken into account. He said this was a similar process to that which would be undertaken shortly in the WTO example, and therefore provided useful lessons of experience on which the WTO could draw. He concluded by saying that his                                                                                     WT/COMTD/M/26                                                                                             Page 7 delegation were aware the greater part of responsibility fell on small economies to develop their own policies and strategies which would enable their full participation in international trade.","WTCOMTDM26.pdf","Guatemala, Humphrey, Burki, Guatemala, Americas, WTO, WTO"
"2171",2171,"22","22.      The representative of Egypt expressed the strong support of his delegation for efforts to understand the problems and limitations of small economies. He said that issues of concern to small states were related to a number of issues which were being addressed by the CTD, such as technical assistance, special and differential treatment and so forth. He said that given the WTO was a rules based system, if small economies or any other Members were to have any rights, these had to be inscribed in the rules. The most important issue however was gaining an understanding of the limitations of small economies, and in this context the draft report was of great value. He recalled that Egypt's approach to the question of special and differential treatment stressed that provisions for special and differential treatment needed to be more targeted to address the needs of different groups of countries. He recalled the statement made in a previous meeting by the representative of Dominica that it was difficult for a country like Dominica to implement the TRIPS Agreement in its entirety with all its costs in the same manner as a developed country. A key question therefore related to the manner in which multilateral organisations dealing with trade issues could accommodate the interests of small economies. To this end, the Vulnerability Index and it components could be put to use within the context of the WTO. The Vulnerability Index was also of use in addressing problems faced by developing countries in general. He noted that one component of the index was lack of export diversification. An approach needed to be found within the WTO, in terms of rights and obligation, that met the concerns of Members that suffered from a lack of export diversification. The representative of Egypt noted that the report pointed to the presence of important transition costs, and also to the fact that vulnerability was independent of income. He also noted that some small states would remain small regardless of any other developments, and that consequently an approach was needed which dealt specifically with the problems of small states. He said his delegation supported the preparation of a paper by the Secretariat which examined the trade structure of small economies and their vulnerability in order to facilitate the understanding of the issues faced by small economies. Finally, he said that his delegation shared the concerns expressed in the Draft Report regarding difficulties which affected small economies in connection with accession, and in connection with participation in the Dispute Settlement Mechanism. He hoped that the creation of an Advisory Centre on WTO, Law which his delegation supported, would be of assistance in this regard.","WTCOMTDM26.pdf","Egypt, CTD, WTO, Members, Egypt, Dominica, Dominica, WTO, WTO, Members, Egypt, Secretariat, WTO"

The representative of Cuba thanked Mr. Burki and Sir Humphrey for their presentation, and said that rather than referring to small states, the concepts of small economies and vulnerability should be made use of, as they reflected the situation of many Members of the WTO. The concept of small states excluded a number of small economies whose present difficulties required special and differential treatment. His delegation believed that vulnerability was the defining factor, and cited the example of Caribbean countries which were prone to natural disasters on a yearly basis. He said that the issue of real access to world markets needed to be taken into account. He noted that Cuba did not appear in either Table 1 or Table 2 of the draft report, whereas Cuba did appear on a list of vulnerable countries prepared by the World Bank.","WTCOMTDM26.pdf","Cuba, Burki, Humphrey, Members, WTO, Caribbean, Cuba, Cuba, World, Bank"

She said that the draft report was a clear and concise document which was particularly useful as an exercise in awareness building. She said that if the issue of vulnerability was new to the WTO, it was not in itself a new issue, as discussions regarding vulnerability had been held for over 15 years. She said that it would be more appropriate to speak of small economies rather than small states in the context of the WTO. She said that small states were compelled to look outwards, and that integration into international trade was not an option but an imperative. The key issue lay in enhancing the capacity of small economies to become full and active participants in the international economy. To this end, her delegation encouraged the WTO to examine ways and means of taking into account the specificities of small economies. She drew attention to the problems of preference erosion faced by the small economies, and the negative impact WTO agreements sometimes had on WT/COMTD/M/26 Page 8 the interests of small economies, as evidenced by the recent banana crisis. Her delegation also echoed the point made by the representative of Egypt that vulnerability existed regardless of income.","WTCOMTDM26.pdf","Trinidad, and, Tobago, Burki, Humphrey, WTO, WTO, WTO, WTO, Egypt"

The representative of Mauritius thanked Mr. Burki and Sir Humphrey for their presentations, and added that further time for reflection regarding the contents of the draft report was necessary. He said the linkage between issues related to smallness and vulnerability, on one hand, and trade, on the other, needed to be clearly spelled out. He noted that Mauritius had been used as a case-study, and said that the attempt to draw a parallel with Cyprus did not highlight the distinctive differences between the two countries. Cyprus was close to its main markets by virtue of its geographical location, whereas Mauritius was outside the main air and sea transport routes. He said that the period of unprecedented growth experienced by Mauritius was a result of, amongst other things, the strategic alliances it had forged with it main trading partners. A key element of these partnerships was the Lomé Convention. He said the comparative advantage of Mauritius was propelled by such preferential frameworks. He said that while Mauritius recognised that it could not depend in perpetuity on preferences, and that preferential systems had to be compatible with WTO rules, it still remained a vulnerable economy.","WTCOMTDM26.pdf","Mauritius, Burki, Humphrey, Mauritius, Cyprus, Cyprus, Mauritius, Mauritius, Mauritius, Mauritius, WTO"

"2178",2178,"29","29.      Mr Burki said, in response to a question raised by the representative of Bolivia, that there was no contradiction between the promotion of creditworthiness on the one hand, and the point made about graduation thresholds on the other, and added that the one point supported the other. He said, for instance, that if a country was about to graduate from concessional lending through IDA and it was determined that that country had some of the characteristics that justified flexibility, then that country would continue to benefit from IDA lending, which would in turn bolster its credit worthiness. Regarding the question raised by the representative of Bolivia regarding successful restructuring, Mr. Burki referred to the Bolivian experience under President Banzer which was based, in part, on exploiting the comparative advantage of the country. The World Bank had associated itself with the strategy, and had also introduced its comprehensive development framework. Regarding definitional issues, he emphasised that the Joint Task Force had deliberately chosen not to be precise when making lists of countries, and had focused instead on presenting a certain number of stylised facts. It had deliberately chose to use the term small states since it focused on the absorptive capacity of these states to, amongst other things, deal with foreign assistance, access markets, or to bring about                                                                                      WT/COMTD/M/26                                                                                              Page 9 change. It was left to international organisations to decide for themselves what criteria they would use to tackle problems posed by smallness and vulnerability.

It also addressed the need to enhance the capacity of least-developed countries to participate in global trade and rule making, and also the need to identify issues of interest to least-developed countries to promote and safeguard potential benefits, and to protect such countries from possible risks and losses. The meeting formulated a Comprehensive New Plan of Action (CNPA) aimed at integrating least-developed countries into the multilateral trading system. The proposals contained in the CNPA covered a broad range of issues of key interest to least-developed countries.

Furthermore, it demonstrated that the reform of the ITC was complete. This was welcomed by the representatives to the JAG. The capacity of the ITC to meet the needs of its core clients was emphasised. An effort had been made to distinguish between two fundamental programmes of the ITC, namely the Joint ITC/UNCTAD/WTO/Integrated Technical Assistance Programme in Selected Least-Developed and Other African Countries ( JITAP), and the Integrated Framework for Trade-Related Technical Assistance to Least-Developed Countries. Regarding the latter, the pivotal role of the ITC in coordinating and managing activities which involved the six agencies was highlighted by representatives. The interaction between the ITC and the other agencies was an example of coherence in policy-making between institutions. Members had stressed the importance of striking a balance between inter-regional, regional and national programmes. Concerns had been expressed about the decline in extra-budgetary resources, and also regarding the marginalisation of least-developed countries in the process of globalisation. The importance project coordination at the conceptual phase, as well as the execution stage, was stressed. The ITC was encouraged to strengthen its cooperation with other United Nations organisations such as UNIDO and the ILO, as well as with the Bretton Woods institutions, and to develop partnerships with civil society.","WTCOMTDM26.pdf","Ambassador, Noirfalisse, Joint, Advisory, Board, UNCTAD, WTO, ITC, ITC, ITC, ITC, Joint, ITC/UNCTAD/WTO, /, Integrated, Technical, Assistance, Programme, Integrated, Framework, for, Trade-Related, Technical, Assistance, ITC, ITC, Members, ITC, United, Nations, UNIDO, ILO, Bretton, Woods"

The representative of Haiti thanked Ambassador Noirfalisse for his statement and Mr. Bélisle for the report of the Joint Advisory Group, and said his delegation thanked donors who supported the work of the ITC. He said that the ITC needed further resources to comprehensively address the needs of developing countries, and particularly the least-developed countries. His delegation commended the ITC, the UNCTAD, and the WTO for their close collaboration, and expressed the hope that the three other organisations participating in the Integrated Framework for Trade-Related Technical Assistance, would follow this example. He said that a certain reluctance was detected on the part of certain agencies to take part fully in the Integrated Framework, and, taking Haiti as an example, cited the World bank as one agency that was particularly hesitant. He said that the CTD could make these concerns known to the relevant organisations.","WTCOMTDM26.pdf","Haiti, Ambassador, Noirfalisse, Bélisle, Joint, Advisory, Group, ITC, ITC, ITC, UNCTAD, WTO, Integrated, Framework, for, Trade-Related, Technical, Assistance, Haiti, CTD"

He underlined the fact that financing for the ITC was forthcoming both from developed countries and developing countries. His delegation viewed such financing as investments which would generate significant returns. His delegation expressed the hope that other developing countries would make contributions.","WTCOMTDM26.pdf","Switzerland, Ambassador, Noirfalisse, Bélisle, Joint, Advisory, Group, ITC"
"2193",2193,"42","42.      Mr. Bélisle, referring to the statement made by the representative of Mexico, said that regional activities were funded through the regular budget, and were for the benefit of all regions equally and without distinction. Specific projects undertaken at the national level were funded through extra-budgetary sources. Regarding partnerships with civil society, he said that the ITC worked principally with civil society, that is, the private sector, academia and, more recently, with NGOs. The ITC had developed networks with the academic community with a view to improving the implementation of programmes, including training programmes. The ITC had a programme known as Export Led Poverty Alleviation, and the ITC had sought to draw in NGOs in the implementation of this programme. Regarding the Executive Forum on National Export Strategies to be held in September 1999, he said that the intention was to bring together about 13 countries to participate in four days of brainstorming on trade promotion. A number of countries had asked the ITC to present examples of countries that had been successfully in trade promotion. The selection of countries made was on the basis, amongst other things, of region, and in order to ensure that LDCs, developing countries and countries in transition were represented. Countries were invited only if the ITC was satisfied that both the representative from the business community and that from government were able to make a substantive contribution. It was the intention of the ITC to publish the proceedings of the meetings, and he hoped that the meeting would be repeated on an annual basis. Regarding support received from the donors, the fact that developing countries were counted amongst donors, showed the importance of the ITC to developing countries. He acknowledged the support the representative of Norway had announced, and added that Norway had recently organised consultations relating to the implementation of private sector development strategies in developing countries and the role of the ITC.","WTCOMTDM26.pdf","Bélisle, Mexico, ITC, ITC, ITC, ITC, ITC, ITC, ITC, ITC, Norway, Norway, ITC"

"2195",2195,"44","44.      The Chairperson recalled the discussions on this subject held at the 25th Session of the CTD. A number of delegations had expressed their concerns regarding the format and content of the document Electronic Commerce and Development (Job No. 2987), which summarised points regarding Electronic Commerce made in meetings of the CTD and during the Seminar on Electronic Commerce. It had been agreed that the Secretariat would undertake further work on the document, taking into account points made by Members at the 25th Session. The Secretariat also undertook further consultations with delegations that intervened during the CTD meeting on 16 June, and set the 25 June as a deadline for written submissions to be incorporated in the document. Members should therefore have had ample opportunity to provide an input into the preparation of the revised document. The Secretariat had produced a new document (Job No. 3943), which took account of the comments and contributions made by Members. The document had been circulated to Members at the beginning of this week, and the Chairperson asked if members had any comments to make regarding the document.","WTCOMTDM26.pdf","Chairperson, CTD, Electronic, Commerce, and, Development, Electronic, Commerce, CTD, Secretariat, Members, Secretariat, CTD, Members, Secretariat, Members, Members, Chairperson"
"2196",2196,"45","45.     The representative of Mexico thanked the Secretariat for the new document. He noted that reference had been made to the issue of domain names in paragraph 16, and said that monopoly over domain names had an adverse impact on small and medium enterprises and developing countries in general. He therefore suggested that the question of domain names be included under point 35 in the section ""Illustrative list of questions for further study"".","WTCOMTDM26.pdf","Mexico, Secretariat"
"2197",2197,"46","46.     The representative of Korea recalled a question asked by the representative of the United States during the 25th Session of the CTD regarding the reference made to Article XX in paragraph 1 of the document. The representative of Korea said that Article XX exceptions (under GATT 1947) provided for the fact that the content of GATT should not damage the public order. His delegation had raised the question in view of the fact that the contents of e-commerce could be affected by this article, even though it was unclear as to whether Article XX could be feasible applied given the nature of electronic commerce.","WTCOMTDM26.pdf","Korea, United, States, CTD, Korea, GATT, GATT"
"2198",2198,"47","47.       The representative of Brazil said the paper reflected the deliberations of the CTD on electronic commerce. He said that the paper should be called a progress report, in order to be consistent with the work done in other committees and to reflect the fact that the CTD had not finished its work on electronic commerce. Regarding paragraph 7, he said that the words ""electronic commerce"" should be replaced by the words ""information technology"", since it was the latter rather than electronic commerce that was the means for conducting trade facilitation. Alternatively, if this substitution could not be made, a sentence could be added to the effect that some members did not believe that the discussion of electronic commerce and trade facilitation fell under the current work programme, since they were of the view that electronic commerce had little to do with trade facilitation. Regarding paragraph 11, he said the wording of the last sentence seemed to indicate that there was a link between the absence competition laws and policies and problems in the use of development assistance funds, and added that it was unclear how one would affect the other. Regarding paragraph 15, the representative of Brazil said that the issue of taxation was one of national economic policy – particularly with respect to the development of the domestic information technology industry – and not limited to the concept of sovereignty. Regarding paragraph 16, he asked why mention was made, in the 7th line, of the WTO. In order to be consistent, either this reference to the WTO had to be deleted, or mention had to be made of the WTO in all other areas cited in paragraph 16.","WTCOMTDM26.pdf","Brazil, CTD, CTD, Brazil, WTO, WTO, WTO"

"2200",2200,"49","49.     The representative of Uruguay thanked the secretariat for the paper, and supported the changes suggested by Brazil, especially in regard to the last section of paragraph 11. Regarding the point made by the representative of Mexico regarding domain names, the representative of Uruguay brought to the attention of the CTD the fact that there was taking place a meeting of the TRIPS Council in which the question of domain names was being addressed. He said that the TRIPS Council was the proper forum in which to address the question of domain names, adding that his delegation did not have any objection to the inclusion of domain names under the rubric of questions for further study, as proposed by Mexico.","WTCOMTDM26.pdf","Uruguay, Brazil, Mexico, Uruguay, CTD, Mexico"
"2201",2201,"5","5.       The Chairperson recalled that the question of small economies had been discussed in the 22nd, 23 and 24th Sessions of the CTD. A paper on the subject had been circulated jointly by    rd six delegations, namely, Barbados, Jamaica, Mauritius, Trinidad and Tobago, Lesotho, and Sri Lanka. This paper emphasised the fragility and vulnerability, and other characteristics, of small economies. The delegations of Fiji and Guatemala had also circulated documents describing their own particular conditions. A number of delegations had supported the statements made by small economies, and some had proposed that the Secretariat begin work on the subject of small economies, leading to a definition of small economies and the development of specific proposals. The Secretariat had participated in the meeting held in St. Lucia, in February 1999, during which the question of small WT/COMTD/M/26 Page 2 states had been abundantly discussed, and where concrete proposals had been made regarding, inter alia, the strengthening of the capacity of small economies trade, and strengthening the participation of small economies in the multilateral trading system.","WTCOMTDM26.pdf","Chairperson, CTD, Barbados, Jamaica, Mauritius, Trinidad, and, Tobago, Lesotho, Sri, Lanka, Fiji, Guatemala, Secretariat, Secretariat, St., Lucia"

"2204",2204,"52","52.      The representative of Switzerland said he had a number of detailed comments his delegation had received from their experts. He followed Brazil in saying that the paper should be called a progress report. He said that as the paper was a compilation, it did lack some analytical depth, and additional elements could be brought in at the following stage of the process. Regarding the section on questions for further study, he said that paragraphs 27 and 28, relating respectively to the effects of electronic commerce on the commercial presence and the movement of natural persons, and the effects of electronic commerce on market access opportunities for developing country enterprises, were unclear. He said that paragraph 27 should cover all four modes of supply rather than just those of commercial presence and the movement of natural persons. The representative of Switzerland said clarification was needed as to how work done in the CTD would be tied in with work done in other bodies in the WTO and in other fora. He said that reference should have been made to the World Bank, given the importance of financial aspects, infrastructure and technical assistance. Finally, he sought clarification from the Chairperson as to how work on the subject of e-commerce would proceed in the CTD.","WTCOMTDM26.pdf","Switzerland, Brazil, Switzerland, CTD, WTO, World, Bank, Chairperson, CTD"
"2205",2205,"53","53.      The representative of the United States said that his delegation found the proposals regarding modifications to be made to the text to be acceptable. He suggested that the modified document be circulated to delegations, with a deadline of 72 hours for comments. Regarding point 7, he said that while the delegation of Brazil was technically correct in stressing information technology, rather than electronic commerce, in relation to trade facilitation, it was also true that electronic commerce was a new phenomenon to which it was necessary to draw attention.","WTCOMTDM26.pdf","United, States, Brazil"

The draft document, which existed only in English, was to be presented to a meeting of the Joint Task Force on 9 July 1999. This meeting was to be attended by the Ambassador of Mauritius, and Mr. Peter Tulloch on behalf of the Secretariat. The draft report was also to be presented to the Commonwealth Consultative Group on 12 July 1999.

He also said that he would provide an overview of ongoing work on electronic commerce in the UNCTAD, and its links with the work on electronic commerce followed by the CTD and the WTO in general.","WTCOMTDM26.pdf","Lanvin, Chairperson, UNCTAD, UNCTAD, CTD, WTO"
"2220",2220,"67","67.      Mr. Lanvin said that the workshop was the first of its type in the context of preparations for UNCTAD X. The working group of experts had addressed two fundamental aspects of electronic commerce as it related to the work of enterprises in developing countries: that is, an assessment of the current state of play, and second the identification of areas of action to enhance the participation of developing country enterprises in electronic commerce. In connection with the first rubric, he said that presentations had been made, notably by the ITU, which provided up to date data on infrastructure, internet connectivity and relative costs of electronic commerce in developing countries. It was noted that situations diverged widely between developing countries, and that a number of issues that went well beyond the subject of electronic commerce had to be addressed in order to enhance the participation of developing country enterprises, and notably small and medium enterprises (SMEs), in electronic commerce. Key priority issues included the deregulation of the telecommunications sector and competition policy in relation to internet access. A significant place was given to the direct exchange of experiences between companies that were either users of electronic commerce or service providers to electronic commerce users. Experts present included a number from advanced countries, but also least-developed countries such as Nepal and Benin. A special session had also been held on domain names. A number of experts involved in the ICAN process updated the meeting regarding the latest developments in the area. Experts from the WIPO had made a presentation on the link between domain names and trademarks.","WTCOMTDM26.pdf","Lanvin, ITU, Nepal, Benin, ICAN, WIPO"
"2221",2221,"68","68.      Mr. Lanvin said that the second part of the of the workshop devoted to areas of action identified four domains. The first concerned the facilitation of access and the reduction of access costs relating to electronic commerce infrastructure and the internet. It was noted that innovative policy approaches were in place in a number of developing countries. In this context, the exchange of information between countries that had already put their approaches in place and those that were still at the drawing board, was of great value. Second, it was noted that in order to stimulate the participation of developing country enterprises, and particularly SMEs, in electronic commerce, links had to be developed between the virtual world of electronic commerce transactions and the physical world of transactions in goods. While it was clear that trade in services benefitted clearly from electronic commerce, developing countries were liable to rely heavily on trade in manufactures and raw materials and that in this context it was necessary to address issues such as transport, payment and customs formalities as components of an overall strategy. Third, the issue of confidence building was addressed, particularly regarding the security of transactions and payments. Examples of innovative policy approaches were noted. The need to enable SMEs to engage in electronic commerce through modalities that were familiar, notably the use of local languages to describe conditions of sale and offer, was emphasised. Fourth, evidence from countries that had implemented strategies for the development of electronic commerce pointed to the need to develop a national electronic commerce culture. The embryonic nature of regional strategies was noted, and the possibility of using existing regional structures, notably in regard to customs, was emphasised.","WTCOMTDM26.pdf","Lanvin"
"2222",2222,"69","69.    Mr. Lanvin said that a complete report on the proceedings of the workshop would be forthcoming. The report would also be made available on the UNCTAD web-site, and it was hoped WT/COMTD/M/26 Page 16 that the web-site for the workshop would serve as a focal point for discussion between experts from the private and public sector interested in the question of electronic commerce and development.","WTCOMTDM26.pdf","Lanvin, UNCTAD"

Sir Humphrey and Mr. Burki were accompanied by their colleagues, Dr. Chris Easter              from the Commonwealth Secretariat and Messrs Constantine Tsatos and Edgardo Favero from the World Bank.

"2224",2224,"70","70.     Mr. Lanvin turned to other work of UNCTAD with regard to electronic commerce. He informed the CTD that a workshop had been held at the national level in Caracas, Venezuela from 28-29 June 1999. The workshop was geared to the development of national strategies for electronic commerce and drew on many of the conclusions adopted at the workshop of 17-18 June he had just presented. The Caracas seminar had led to the creation of a national working group involving private sector and public sector participants, which sought to develop the legal, technical, economic and fiscal details of the overall strategy for electronic commerce. It was intended that the results of the workshop held in Caracas feed into a regional meeting on electronic commerce for Latin American and Caribbean countries programmed for 4-5 August in Lima, Peru. This regional meeting was one of three regional meetings planned by the UNCTAD for 1999, the other two being programmed for October 1999 for the African and Asia Pacific regions, to be held respectively in Kenya and Sri Lanka.","WTCOMTDM26.pdf","Lanvin, UNCTAD, CTD, Caracas, Venezuela, Caracas, Caracas, Caribbean, Lima, Peru, UNCTAD, Asia, Pacific, Kenya, Sri, Lanka"

Mr. Lanvin informed CTD that a meeting of an UNCTAD working group of legal and regulation experts was planned for 14-16 July 1999 to address issues relating to electronic commerce and development. The fourth session of the UNCTAD on electronic commerce was planned for 19-23 July 1999, in order to discuss developments since UNCTAD IX and possible themes for UNCTAD X. Mr. Lanvin said that since the launching of UNCTAD's work on electronic commerce in 1994, the organisation had followed a cooperative approach, and had invited organisations and agencies with competencies in a number of different areas. Thus both the WTO and the WIPO were invited to the meetings planned for 19-23 July. The UNCTAD had also enjoyed reciprocal treatment from a number of organisations.","WTCOMTDM26.pdf","Lanvin, CTD, UNCTAD, UNCTAD, UNCTAD, UNCTAD, Lanvin, UNCTAD, WTO, WIPO, UNCTAD"

She said a number of Members were of the view that it was important to provide technical cooperation activities with a more solid budgetary base and, in particular, to incorporate, technical cooperation activities into the regular budget of the WTO. She said that she as aware that, since the 25th Session of the CTD, the African Group had held discussion on this subject.

It was also realized that the ability of developing country                                                                                     WT/COMTD/M/26                                                                                            Page 17 Members to meet their obligations and commitments remained, at least partly, contingent on the provision of adequate and satisfactory technical assistance. Notwithstanding the high priority accorded to technical cooperation, the Regular WTO Budget for technical assistance had remained at the same level during the past four years, that is, at CHF741,000. Only through extra-budgetary contributions had the Secretariat been able to fulfill many of the requests for technical assistance from least-developed countries, developing countries and economies in transition. Even regarding the least-developed countries, to which high priority was attached, the 1997 High-Level Meeting did not result in any new financing to implement the Integrated Framework. In addition, the High-Level Meeting also endorsed two other recommendations affecting LDCs. These concerned the need to assist least-developed countries in the process of accession, and the need to provide assistance in preparing their Trade Policy Reviews. No additional resources had been made available for these programmes either. Furthermore, the growing Membership of WTO was likely to result in a further increase in technical assistance.","WTCOMTDM26.pdf","Léger, WTO, WTO, Conferences, Members, WTO, Budget, Secretariat, WTO"
"2230",2230,"76","76.      Mr. Léger said that when the Secretariat last presented the financial situation regarding technical assistance on 4 June 1999, a shortfall of CHF 2.6 million was projected for 1999. On projected expenditures of CHF9.4 million for 1999, already 60 per cent had been committed at that time. The situation was even worse one month later, at the time of the 26th Session. On a cashflow basis, that is, assuming that no additional funding were received in 1999 through extra-budgetary contributions, the available funds had already been entirely committed. In other words, the Secretariat was not in a position to respond positively to any new request for technical assistance in 1999 unless, of course, additional funding was forthcoming (refer to Annex). The financial constraints being faced in 1999 were first announced to the Budget Committee on 25 March 1999 in document CRP(99)07. Owing to the inadequate nature of the regular WTO budget for technical assistance, it had become becomes highly difficult for the Secretariat to undertake any serious planning, even in the short term, and impossible to envisage on-going programmes, when 90 per cent of projected expenditure for 1999 were financed through yearly ad hoc grants which, in turn, were subject to each Member's financial situation and priorities, introducing volatility in the funding process.","WTCOMTDM26.pdf","Léger, Secretariat, Secretariat, Budget, Committee, WTO, Secretariat, Member"

He reaffirmed the Secretariat's intention to continue to work closely with other international organizations, and to enlarge the scope of application to allow the engagement of external consultants to supplement its work. However, it was not possible to out- source all subjects, and the need would remain for a WTO presence in regional and national seminars. Out-sourcing through consultancy contracts, would further increase the financial requirements for technical assistance.","WTCOMTDM26.pdf","Léger, Secretariat, Secretariat, WTO"

Mr. Léger said the establishment of the Global Trust Fund for WTO Technical Cooperation is an important initiative to achieve a more efficient management and implementation of WTO technical cooperation activities.

The origins of the Joint Task Force dated back to July 1998 when a group of Commonwealth Ministers visited the World Bank and requested that a Task Force on Small States be organised. The Joint Task Force had met on three occasions between October 1998 and April 1999. At its last meeting it agreed to produce a paper which would cover four items as follows: (i) background information on why the Joint Task Force was set up, the domestic policies of small states and the past performance of international institutions towards them; (ii) analysis of the vulnerability and the volatility of income of small states; (iii) the major transformation of the international economic and financial order, and the manner in which international community could assist small states in their transition in the new international environment; and (iv) the development of specific policy recommendations by the Commonwealth Secretariat, the World Bank, and it was hoped, by the WTO, the European Union and the International Monetary Fund.","WTCOMTDM26.pdf","Burki, Members, CTD, Joint, Task, Force, Commonwealth, Secretariat, World, Bank, Joint, Task, Force, CTD, Joint, Task, Force, Commonwealth, World, Bank, Joint, Task, Force, Joint, Task, Force, Commonwealth, Secretariat, World, Bank, WTO, European, Union, International, Monetary, Fund"

Extra-budgetary contributions were made by a small number of donors who were not on the whole major trading partners. Technical assistance was an important part of the overall balance of rights and obligations of the Uruguay Round Agreements. Referring to the comments made by the European Communities, he said that donors should take the funding difficulties more seriously. The paper prepared by Mr. Léger should address possible solutions to financing problems. The representative of Egypt said that those members who were talking about comprehensive negotiations, and about further commitments, needed to be aware that developing countries would have great difficulties in accepting new commitments while they experienced difficulties with existing commitments, and technical assistance was not forthcoming.","WTCOMTDM26.pdf","Egypt, Léger, Uruguay, European, Communities, Léger, Egypt"
"2237",2237,"82","82.      The representative of Senegal supported the statement made by Egypt, and added that his delegation had made a presentation on the subject to the African Group. He recalled the commitment in the Agreement Establishing the WTO to ensure that developing countries, including least-developed countries, benefitted from a share in the increase in world trade that was commensurate with their development needs. It was universally recognised that technical assistance was one means by which the increased participation of developing countries, and least-developed countries, in world trade could be achieved. It was therefore important that technical assistance provided was of good quality and had a concrete impact on the trade of developing countries. He said that the needs of developing countries were increasing, while the technical assistance resources availed to them were diminishing. From this point, his delegation had a number of proposals. First it was absolutely necessary that WTO members reaffirmed their commitment to Technical Assistance activities that would respond to the needs of developing countries, including least-developed countries Second, it was necessary to respond to financial constraints by incorporating the funding of Technical assistance activities through the regular budget. Third, it was necessary to address the financial constraints affecting the WTO, by establishing a floor for resources (say, CHF10 million) allocated to technical assistance activities, without prejudice to further funding from extra budgetary sources. Finally, the WTO should organise on an annual basis a day devoted to reflection by members on the issue of technical assistance, which would cover a range of issues such as financing, the delivery of technical assistance and an assessment of its impact.","WTCOMTDM26.pdf","Senegal, Egypt, African, Group, WTO, WTO, WTO, WTO"

The representative of Djibouti said that technical assistance was the only means by which developing countries could arrive at an understanding of the functioning of the WTO.

"2239",2239,"84","84.      The representative of Norway recalled that his delegation had intervened at length on this issue in a previous meeting, and reiterated the importance of funding technical assistance through the regular budget. He said that the establishment of the Global Trust Fund was an intermediate solution which would improve the management of technical assistance, and since his delegation had participated in drafting the modalities for the fund it would disburse its extra budgetary contributions through the fund. He emphasised that the Global trust Fund would not on its own solve the fundamental problem of long term budget planning as this required that all funds be disbursed through the regular budget. He said that there was an issue of fairness at stake, since technical assistance was one of the core activities of the WTO.","WTCOMTDM26.pdf","Norway, WTO"

It was untrue for some delegations to assert that donors such as the European Communities were not taking the problem seriously; the bulk of financing for technical assistance came from the European Communities. He also recalled that at the High Level Symposium on Trade and Development, two Member States of the Communities had each pledged an extra CHF1 million at the meeting. He said that it was of no use to start a polemic regarding the funding of technical assistance, as this would detract from the seriousness of the issue.","WTCOMTDM26.pdf","European, Communities, Egypt, Trade, and, Development, Member"

The representative of Namibia said his delegation associated itself with Egypt and Senegal in stressing the need to develop sustainable means of supporting the delivery of technical assistance. He said that the situation reported by Mr. Léger was an embarrassment, and added that technical assistance was not altruism but a necessary condition for the effective participation of developing countries in the multilateral trading system. Developing countries could not take on board additional obligations without technical assistance. While his delegation were sympathetic to the constraints faced by the Technical Cooperation Division, they did not share the view that outsourcing was necessarily a solution, on the basis that external resource persons often lacked a detailed knowledge of the multilateral trading system, when compared to in-house experts. He said that his delegation supported the proposal by Senegal that a seminar be convened on technical assistance.","WTCOMTDM26.pdf","Namibia, Egypt, Senegal, Léger, Technical, Cooperation, Division, Senegal"

He said that technical assistance was part and parcel of Part IV of the GATT, and was necessary to build lasting capacity in developing countries.

"2245",2245,"9","9.      Mr. Burki highlighted the main points emphasised in the paper prepared by the Joint Task Force. The paper pointed out that small states had roughly the same per capita income and average income growth as large states, but suffered from considerable income volatility. It was important that small states be awarded transition periods, particularly in the light of developments in the area of trade and in the area of Official Development Assistance (ODA). The trade advantages enjoyed by small states resulted in part from preferential market access granted through a variety of arrangements. The evolving trading system threatened to erode the preferences that had worked favour of small states, which were now exposed to the detrimental effects of trade opening. More specifically, the establishment of other preferential trading arrangements and the development of the rules-based multilateral trading system under the aegis of the WTO had eroded the preference margins                                                                                    WT/COMTD/M/26                                                                                            Page 3 which small states had enjoyed. Preferences accorded through the Lomé Convention had lost their value as a result of the tariff cuts of recent years, and the WTO had introduced trade rules which were incompatible with the Lomé Convention. The recent dispute surrounding the banana régime of the European Union had showed how the establishment of the new trade system had created additional challenges for small states. Regarding the availability of ODA, the Joint Task Force had emphasised that ODA flows had been declining over recent years. In 1997, 21 OECD countries provided 0.22 per cent of their combined Gross national product, down from 0.25 per cent in 1996. Total overseas aid dropped from US$55 billion in 1996 to US$48 billion in 1997, but increased somewhat in 1998 as a result of the crises in Asia and Latin America. Aid from G7 countries had dropped by 30 per cent in real terms since 1992. The United States donated less than 0.1 per cent of its GNP as ODA. Small states therefore had to rely on a combination of domestic and foreign savings and private external flows, in order to finance their development. While the fall in ODA had been compensated for by the increase in flows of private external finance, the change in composition of foreign financing meant that the cost of external financing was higher. Furthermore, private external finance was not always available in the quantity required by small states.","WTCOMTDM26.pdf","Burki, Joint, Task, Force, ODA, WTO, WTO, European, Union, ODA, Joint, Task, Force, ODA, OECD, Asia, Latin, America, United, States, ODA, ODA"

She also welcomed the proposals made by the African Group regarding technical assistance, and particularly the proposal relating to the holding of a one day discussion on technical assistance. She said that the CTD could be an appropriate forum in which to hold the discussion.

He repeated that the situation surrounding the funding of technical assistance was alarming, and said that the response made by the European Communities, that they would seek to initiate action as soon as possible, would have been acceptable 6 months before when the issue was first raised. Egypt was very grateful for assistance received through the WTO, and funded by member states of the European Communities, as well as others. His delegation also acknowledged the contributions made by a number of European Members towards the establishment of the International Law Centre. However, one had to judge by observable results, and the truth of the matter was that the projected shortfall in the funding of technical assistance activities was not a new issue, but one that had been the subject of discussion for at least six months. He reiterated that major trading partners had major responsibilities, and that those that benefitted most from the multilateral trading system needed to be the biggest contributors. He repeated that the major component of funding for technical assistance activities came from Members that were not themselves major trading partners. His delegation held the view that adequate provision of technical assistance was a test by which to measure the commitment of developed country members to ensure the effective integration of developing and least-developed countries and the equitable distribution of the benefits of the multilateral trading system. He said it was therefore distressing that every report concerning the funding of technical assistance activities was worse than the preceding one, and added that his delegation would take up the issue at every possible occasion to ensure that it was properly addressed.","WTCOMTDM26.pdf","Egypt, European, Communities, Egypt, WTO, European, Communities, Members, Members"

He said that technical assistance was a means by which to integrate developing countries into the multilateral trading system, and was an integral part of the balance of rights and obligations. If the provision of technical assistance to developing countries was inadequate, they would not be in a position to accept new obligations, nor in a position to fully implement existing commitments. He also made reference to discussions that had taken place in the Committee on Market Access, and said that developing countries had been required to provide information to the Integrated Database. Developing countries could not meet this requirement owing to lack of capacity, and at the same time they were told that the funds were lacking to provide the necessary technical assistance. This was a glaring internal consistency in the working of the WTO. Finally, he said that while it was appropriate to thank donors for providing funding, it was also appropriate to encourage all developed trading partners to provide resources for the delivery of technical assistance.","WTCOMTDM26.pdf","Cuba, Egypt, Senegal, Mauritius, Committee, on, Market, Access, Integrated, Database, WTO"

A longer term perspective needed to take into account the fact that there had seemed to be a surplus at the end of 1998. It was also important to take into account the fact that forthcoming trade negotiations would place heavy demands on the human resources of the WTO Secretariat. One solution, from a longer term perspective, to the problem of adequate provisions of resources, both financial and human, for technical assistance lay in increased coherence with other international organisations, notably the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank.","WTCOMTDM26.pdf","Japan, Chairperson, Chairperson, Budget, Committee, WTO, Secretariat, International, Monetary, Fund, World, Bank"

He said the present crisis stemmed from the persistently low level of funding through the regular budget. The establishment of the GTF was a stop-gap measure, and a long term resolution of the problems relating to the funding of technical assistance activities required that ways be developed to increase funding through the regular budget.

The Chairperson recalled that in the 25th Session the Committee had been informed about the critical financial situation in technical co-operation and about the resulting difficulties of the Secretariat in responding to Members' requests. The Committee had requested the Chairperson to bring this matter before the Committee on Budget, Finance and Administration (CBFA). Accordingly, at the informal meeting of the CBFA on 14 September 1999, the Chairperson of the CTD and a representative of the Secretariat gave an overview of the situation. The Chairperson thanked the Chairperson of the CBFA for organizing the informal Meeting of the CBFA and for the very positive exchanges of views that Members had on this subject. She reported that there was a widely shared view that the funding of technical assistance should among the areas for immediate decision by Ministers in Seattle.

The representative of the WTO Secretariat said that, at the informal meeting of the CBFA on 14 September 1999, Members had requested that the information provided on resources and expenditure on technical co-operation for 1999 be provided in writing and this was contained in document WT/COMTD/20, in which the information was also updated to 15 September 1999. The document distinguished three types of resources used for technical co-operation: the Regular Budget, Extra-Budgetary funds used for special activities and Other Extra-Budgetary funds. The second part of the document provided a brief review of the evolution of technical assistance activities since 1995, demonstrating the rapid growth in demand for such activities, most of which were now financed by extra-budgetary funds.","WTCOMTDM27.pdf","WTO, Secretariat, Members"
"2269",2269,"18","18.     The representative of Turkey asked the Secretariat to distribute to the CTD Members a document relating to the impact on Member's contributions in 2000 of possible increases in technical assistance funding through the Regular Budget resulting from the possible shift of funding from Extra-Budgetary funds to the Regular Budget.","WTCOMTDM27.pdf","Turkey, Secretariat, CTD, Members, Member, Regular, Budget"
"2270",2270,"19","19.      In response, later in the day, the representative of the WTO Secretariat circulated to Members two documents (CRP (99) 31 and 32) on scales of contribution. He explained that the Secretariat had provided information on two options for the integration of a total of Frs. 10 million into the regular budget. Under one option, there was an expansion to Frs. 4 million in the first year, to be followed by two more equal annual increases of Frs. 3 million, over a total of three years. Under the second scenario, the full amount of Frs. 10 million would be integrated in one step. These scenarios had been proposed by Members in the General Council. The figures were also based on the budgetary proposals put forward by the Director-General for 2000 year, and did not take into account any changes that might result from the general review of the budget currently being undertaken in the Budget Committee. However, in any event the last column of each document would not change since it represented the difference (Frs. 4 million in the first table, and Frs. 10 million in the second) that was the impact of Members contribution in the integration of the Regular budget in the first year under the two scenarios.","WTCOMTDM27.pdf","WTO, Secretariat, Members, Secretariat, Members, General, Council, Director-General, Budget, Committee, Members"

"2273",2273,"21","21.     The Chairperson recalled that, according to the guidelines adopted by CTD on 15 October 1996, the three-year plan for technical co-operation was to be presented to the CTD at its last Session of the year. The document WT/COMTD/W/64 was a first draft for the three-year plan, 2000-02. Given the critical financial technical assistance situation, as well as other issues, such as the launch of the ""Global Trust Fund"" for technical co-operation by some Members; the presentation of a number of proposals on the approach, the funding, the administration and evaluation of technical co-operation activities; the results of the Working Group on improved technical co-operation, which had been circulated in March 1999; and the decisions to be taken in Seattle, the Secretariat had decided that a conservative approach had to be taken in preparing the three-year plan. She also noted that the document raised several questions which needed to be examined, in particular, the broad guidelines for technical co-operation activities in 2000. Some specific activities, divided up by regions, could be found in Annex 1 of the WT/COMTD/W/64. For the years 2001 and 2002, the document gave some general vision in keeping with the spirit of continuity and it also contained some general information on priorities for the future. She suggested that, as the CTD had just received this document and bearing in mind the aforementioned considerations, the CTD come back to the issue at WT/COMTD/M/27 Page 4 its first meeting in 2000. In that way, the CTD would be able to take account of decisions taken in Seattle. Nevertheless, she asked if there were any comments on the subject.","WTCOMTDM27.pdf","Chairperson, CTD, CTD, Members, Working, Group, Seattle, Secretariat, CTD, CTD, CTD, Seattle"

The representative of Guatemala noted that in the programme there were no changes to the programme of Trade Policy Courses that were normally held every two years for Spanish-speaking countries. He asked that more frequent courses for Spanish-speaking countries, once or even twice a year, be included in the three-year plan. Spanish-speaking countries had raised this concern on more than one occasion and they had sent a letter to the Director-General, Mr. Moore, on this subject. They hoped that their concerns would be taken into account.","WTCOMTDM27.pdf","Guatemala, Director-General, Moore"

"2278",2278,"26","26.      The Chairperson recalled that the work programme of the CTD had been discussed at the previous meeting in July, based on an informal note by the Secretariat, and that, at that time, the Committee had dealt with the period to the Ministerial Conference in Seattle. Since then delegates had been focusing on the draft Ministerial Declaration for Seattle. Accordingly, she suggested that the Committee might look at what had been achieved hitherto and to have a preliminary discussion on what the Committee should do after Seattle. In her view, four main themes could be discerned under the Committee's terms of references: special and differential treatment; technical co-operation; participation of developing countries in multilateral trading system; and the experience of the developing countries with their own implementation and the implementation by their partners of WTO agreements. She also said that, at this stage, the Secretariat was completing two studies requested by the Committee: a paper on Special and Differential Treatment, of which a draft had been sent to Members, and a paper with updated statistics on the participation of developing countries in international trade. The Chairperson asked the Secretariat to inform the CTD on the progress of these studies.","WTCOMTDM27.pdf","Chairperson, CTD, Secretariat, Committee, Seattle, Seattle, Committee, Committee, Seattle, Committee, WTO, Secretariat, Committee, Members, Chairperson, Secretariat, CTD"
"2279",2279,"27","27.      The representative of the WTO Secretariat said that the two studies mentioned by the Chairperson were close to finalization. The study on special and differential treatment had been more or less completed by the summer of 1999. However, the Secretariat had since received some additional information from other divisions of the Secretariat. This information referred to discussions on special and differential treatment in individual committees of the WTO. He stated that the Secretariat was on the very last stages of this paper, and he hoped that this paper could be made available to Members shortly. The second paper, relating to the participation of developing countries in the multilateral trading system, would be based on statistics on international trade available up to 1998 or 1999. The Secretariat was trying to include, as far as possible, data for 1999 to try to get some feel for the latest developments. The Secretariat did not want to look at only at the time of the financial crises and the immediate effect on the financial crises on trade of developing countries, which was obviously very important in 1998, but, hopefully, also to look at developments through the first seven or eight months of 1999. The first part of the paper was a very long term look at the development of developing countries trade since the beginning of the GATT 1948 up to the present time, and this would be based on the paper that the Secretariat had produced for the High Level Symposium in March 1999. The second part would take a look at developing countries' trade from 1990 to 1998, or least to the financial crises. The third part would try to analyse developments during                                                                                    WT/COMTD/M/27                                                                                            Page 5 and following the financial crises of 1997-98. The Secretariat had already drafted the second part of the paper and was now looking at the data for the third part. The Secretariat had not been able to complete the paper until now because reliable data were not been available for 1999; these were important to show the post-crisis developments. He hoped that the paper would be completed before the Seattle Meeting, as requested by Members of the Committee.","WTCOMTDM27.pdf","WTO, Secretariat, Chairperson, Secretariat, Secretariat, WTO, Secretariat, Members, Secretariat, Secretariat, GATT, Secretariat, Secretariat, Secretariat, Seattle, Meeting, Members, Committee"
"2280",2280,"28","28.     Regarding the ""Illustrative List of Elements for a Possible Work Programme"" prepared by the Secretariat, (the Illustrative List), the representative of the United States asked the Committee to consider the same approach that the Chairperson had recommended for the Technical Assistance Three-Year Plan. The representative of the United States stated that several tirets listed in the document included elements covered by various proposals before the General Council for Seattle. Therefore, she proposed that discussion be deferred until after Seattle, otherwise it would be necessary to include additional points based on suggestions of which Members were aware.","WTCOMTDM27.pdf","Secretariat, United, States, Committee, Chairperson, United, States, General, Council, for, Seattle, Seattle, Members"
"2281",2281,"29","29.      The Chairperson thought that the representative of the United States was in agreement with her proposal to hold discussions after Seattle, that is, in the first half of the year 2000. She drew attention to the fact that the Illustrative List brought together under four broad headings all the elements that had been previously discussed. However, she would appreciate hearing from the Committee on the priorities that Members attached to these four headings, for instance, elements that Members believed needed further work or areas in which the Committee could cooperate with other international institutions, such as the fiscal implications of liberalization, where the World Bank and the IMF had carried out significant studies. She asked what approaches the Committee might usefully follow. For example, did Members think it worthwhile having seminars that could be organized under the auspices of the CTD and at which with experts might be invited to present and discuss their studies with Members outside of the formal framework of discussions? The CTD also needed to look at special and differential treatment. She would like to hear Members' comments.","WTCOMTDM27.pdf","Chairperson, United, States, Seattle, Committee, Members, Members, Committee, World, Bank, IMF, Committee, Members, CTD, Members, CTD, Members"
"2282",2282,"3","3.      Continuing the series of information sessions on related work of other international organisations, the Chairperson invited Mr. Jean-Claude Faure, Chairman of the OECD Development Assistance Committee (DAC), to make a presentation about the work the DAC in the development of trade capacity.

"2283",2283,"30","30.      The representative of the European Commission (EC) stated that he welcomed the Illustrative List drafted by the Secretariat. However, points (I), (II), (IV) were the subject of proposals for Seattle, and it was premature to start a lengthy discussion on how to approach these issues which might be overtaken by events in six weeks time and which might seem to prejudge many political issues. He proposed that the Committee use the disclaimer ""Pending the Outcome of the Seattle Ministerial"" before ""Illustrative List of Elements for a Possible Work Programme"". If the Committee put this kind of sentence in bold in the heading, everybody would understand the character of the document.","WTCOMTDM27.pdf","European, Commission, EC, Secretariat, Seattle, Committee, Seattle, Committee"
"2284",2284,"31","31.      The representative of the United States noted that her previous intervention was in lieu of putting disclaimers into the document, such as that suggested by the EC. However, it was not enough to put in a disclaimer. For example, in paragraph (II) on capacity building there was a reference to a proposal having been made for a day of reflection on technical co-operation activities. In fact, several proposals had been made and this was being highlighted over others. She said that the United States would perhaps like to see other proposals listed in the Illustrative List at this time, pending the outcome in Seattle. Elements could even be added to this Illustrative List in Seattle. If the Committee went into this discussion at the present time or just put in a disclaimer, that would not do justice to the amount of work on proposals that had been already put in the General Council and in the preparatory process. She would have to see whether the proposal for a day of reflection was before the CTD or any other body. The United States with other delegations had made a proposal for a regular review of these issues in the General Council. The United States would not be comfortable with an illustrative list that only mentioned one proposal.","WTCOMTDM27.pdf","United, States, EC, United, States, Seattle, Seattle, Committee, General, Council, CTD, United, States, General, Council, United, States"
"2285",2285,"32","32.       The representative of Mexico stated that he needed to consult with his capital on the Illustrative List. However, what was described on the Illustrative List were development-related WT/COMTD/M/27 Page 6 aspects, and this should be clearly defined. As in the case of capacity building, that the Committee was talking about matters that should be focused on development.","WTCOMTDM27.pdf","Mexico, Committee"
"2286",2286,"33","33.      The representative of Japan said that Japan welcomed the Illustrative List as a good basis for discussion. Nevertheless, he had the same concerns that had been raised by the EC and the United States. Members were, at this moment, in the preparatory process for the Ministerial Conference in Seattle. There were also substantial proposals, made in the drafting phase of the Ministerial Declaration, that were not reflected in the document, such as the proposal to elevate the LDC Sub-Committee to a full committee. If this were accepted, what would be the relationship between the CTD and the Committee on LDCs? Would the concerns of small economies be raised in the CTD or in the future possible Committee on LDCs? Another example was sustainable development which was very important for Japan, but which was not covered in the Illustrative List. The list was useful, but the Committee could not be seen to prejudge the outcome of the Ministerial Conference of Seattle. Therefore, the Illustrative List should be sent to capitals for consideration and then the CTD could revert to the issue after the Seattle in informal or formal mode.","WTCOMTDM27.pdf","Japan, Japan, EC, United, States, Members, Seattle, LDC, Sub-Committee, CTD, Committee, CTD, Committee, Japan, Committee, Seattle, CTD, Seattle"
"2287",2287,"34","34.     The representative of India thought that there were two or three points of which Members might wish to take note. The first, mentioned by the EC, had also arisen in the Committee on Trade and Environment which had used the phrase ""pending the future work programme"". There, Members did not even want references to Third Ministerial Conference in Seattle. The delegation of Japan was right. There were several proposals which if accepted might or might not change the nature of the work in the CTD. Japan would obviously want to change the role of the CTD to that of an advisory role. India would not necessarily share this view at this point of time without understanding fully what an advisory role meant and what impact it would have on the various negotiating groups. In order to preserve Members' positions, India suggested that the Committee either went in one or two ways. One way approach might be to say ""pending the future work programme"". Otherwise, it would be necessary to go through the painful process of referring this document to the capitals and sitting down and negotiating. He supported the former approach, because those words had been used in another Committee which was at least similar if not the same. He proposed that the CTD stated ""pending the future work programme"" and then went on saying ""Illustrative List"" and that Members would come back to take a final decision at the first meeting in 2000.","WTCOMTDM27.pdf","India, Members, EC, Committee, on, Trade, and, Environment, Members, Seattle, Japan, CTD, Japan, CTD, India, Members, India, Committee, Committee, CTD, Members"
"2288",2288,"35","35.      The representative of Canada stated that this matter had been already discussed several times during the summer CTD session. She thought that, generally speaking, the Illustrative List corresponded to the points raised in the CTD. The list obviously did not try to coordinate all the proposals made by all delegations in the context of the General Council's work. She proposed that the CTD examine the list at the appropriate time and come back to it on January 2000 year when the results of the Ministerial Meeting were known. Those results would set out the priorities that the CTD should adopt, and nobody at the present CTD meeting wished to prejudge what would be decided at the Ministerial Meeting. As the Illustrative List did not have an official number, the CTD probably did not need to take any action on the document. It should be put it on hold and the CTD could come back to it in January at an informal meeting. In the meantime, the Secretariat might even revise it in the light of the Ministerial results.","WTCOMTDM27.pdf","Canada, CTD, General, Council, CTD, CTD, CTD, CTD, Secretariat"

As Chairman of an OECD Committee, I fully share in the consensus emerging from the OECD Ministerial meeting last May that in a new trade Round, development considerations must be a central element.         As Chairman of the Development Assistance Committee (DAC), I want to convey just how much importance the donor community attaches to interacting with the trade community, to better understanding the opportunities and constraints faced by developing countries as they strive to become more prominent players in the world trading system, and to working actively to help them do so through the instruments of development co-operation.         I welcome this opportunity therefore to be able to inform you of the ways in which we work in the DAC and how donors might be able to respond constructively to some of the trade challenges faced by our developing partners.         Allow me to say a few words about the role of the DAC in the OECD, how we operate and how, through the co-ordinated activities of our Member states, we might make a contribution to enhancing the capacity of developing countries to share in the dynamic synergies between trade and growth in the global economy.          As an intergovernmental organisation that promotes policy dialogue on a wide range of policy issues of relevance to its 29 Member states, the OECD has no executive powers or funds to disburse. It does not provide technical assistance in any classical sense, except in a few exceptional cases. But by providing analysis in and across different policy areas as a basis for dialogue, encouraging peer review and good practices, working to produce policy guidelines and harmonising views as a basis for effective approaches to international issues, Member states benefit a great deal from sharing experiences with others. And increasingly, this process of sharing experience, good practices and guidelines is extending beyond the membership of the OECD, as our Organisation reaches out to other regions and actors.         This work of the OECD is essentially accomplished through our Committee structures. The DAC is one such Committee, where representatives from bilateral agencies, with the UNDP, the World Bank and the IMF as permanent observers, try to develop common approaches, enhance effectiveness of aid delivery, improve co-ordination among donors, identify good practices and develop guidelines.         In 1996, the DAC produced a short, high level report ""Shaping the 21st Century: the Role of Development Co-operation"", which laid out a strategy based on internationally agreed development goals and partnership principles. This has since become known as the Development Partnerships Strategy. I must say that this approach has proved to be a powerful influence in the international system. Just a few weeks ago, at the time of the annual IMF/WB meetings in Washington, it was agreed that World Bank and IMF programmes for poor countries will in future be based on poverty WT/COMTD/M/27 Page 10 reduction strategies and partnership principles. The Managing Director of the IMF, M. Camdessus, set out in the form of 7 Pledges , the key UN Conference goals that had been identified in the DAC Report.         The centrepiece of these goals is the reduction of the incidence of poverty by one half by the year 2015. It is clear that such a goal can only be achieved if developing countries can generate a dynamic and sustainable growth process. That requires the possibility and the capacity to engage in, a dynamic fashion, in global trade and investment flows. In this context, a new WTO Round will be a major opportunity for the trade policy community to contribute to an historic reduction of poverty in the world at the beginning of the 21st Century. OECD Support for Integrating the Developing Countries in the Global Trading System         In the past two years, the OECD Council at Ministerial level has given prominence to better elaborating the links between trade, investment and development, to promoting more coherent policy making towards developing countries, and to enhancing the role of the OECD in helping to integrate developing countries in the global trading system. At the meeting this year, Ministers emphasised that the new Round must be responsive to the needs of all developing countries and that in this respect, particular emphasis must be given to the special needs of least developed countries, including improved market access.         These views were echoed also at the DAC’s High Level Meeting of Development Ministers in May of this year. The DAC HLM stressed the importance of reflecting development perspectives in preparations for the new Trade Round. Ministers also indicated that development co-operation could help identify effective instruments and approaches to build capacity for trade, for implementing Uruguay Round Agreements and for effective developing country participation in the new round. These messages have also been emphasised at the Cologne G8 Summit and at the annual World Bank/IMF meetings just three weeks ago.        In short, we consider the relationship between trade and development to be an essential one and a major priority for everyone.          Developing countries clearly have a major responsibility themselves for putting in place trade-friendly policies that promote their further integration in the global economy.         But the OECD countries also recognise that policy coherence matters and the need therefore in OECD capitals, to become more aware of the development impacts of policy incoherence and to better co-ordinate policy-making in instances where trade or other policies risk undermining development prospects.         So what does this mean for the OECD and for the DAC in particular?         We will try to move forward on two fronts.         First, we will confront the challenge of policy coherence by moving to set in train processes, both in OECD countries and at the OECD in Paris, to ensure that the development impact of policy making is analysed, discussed and acted on.        Second, we must try to become better aware of the particular needs and constraints in developing countries for enhancing their capacity to become dynamic participants in trade, and then to respond with effective development co-operation activities.         I will now briefly address these two areas of activity.                                                                                     WT/COMTD/M/27                                                                                            Page 11 Addressing the Challenges of Policy Coherence          The arrangements now in place for addressing policy coherence issues among the WTO, the IMF and the World Bank are an indication that policy coherence is an area that requires systematic attention.        In the OECD, we have responded to a mandate from Ministers to prepare a report on the links between trade, investment and development and how OECD countries can better promote policy coherence. This report, entitled ""Policy Coherence Matters"", has been provided for this meeting.        OECD Ministers thus do indeed recognise the central importance of policy coherence towards developing countries, in national policy-making frameworks as well as in international policy frameworks. But as we all know, coherent policy-making is far from easy in practice. There are numerous political constraints at every level.       Keeping it on the agenda at the OECD is important. And Members of the DAC and the Trade Committee are deepening their interaction as preparations step up for Seattle and beyond.         In the DAC itself, we are now systematically including an assessment of policy coherence in our ""peer review"" process. This is a process of examining each DAC Member’s development co-operation policies and is perhaps comparable to your Trade Policy Review Mechanism. By considering a few issues of policy coherence for each of the DAC Members in the context of the Peer Review, we are able to stimulate awareness and policy discussion processes in capitals.        Further, we are setting out to prepare a ""policy coherence checklist"". This checklist will provide guidance for policy makers in OECD capitals with respect to the impacts of policies on economic and social development in partner countries. It will also consider the institutional aspects of policy coherence to see how different agencies, national and international are able to take development impacts into account. It will address a variety of policy areas including:         -       trade, agriculture and food security, and issues such as research, intellectual property                 rights and information technology;         -       international finance, debt, investment, private sector relations and migration;         -       environment issues;         -       peacekeeping and conflict resolution, and the arms trade.          An important aspect of policy coherence is of course to ensure that trade and investment flows are not only dynamic and inclusive, but contribute to rising social and environmental well being in developing countries. Our current work programme in the DAC includes major projects in these areas. We are working to produce Guidelines for Donor Assistance to Poverty Reduction. And we are supporting the endeavours of developing countries to establish effective processes for defining and implementing national sustainable development strategies and to meet their commitments under global environment conventions. In this way, the development co-operation community is actively engaged, in a direct and practical way, in the social and environmental concerns that are important issues in the WTO forum. WT/COMTD/M/27 Page 12 Integrated Efforts to Enhance Capacity to Trade         The other area where the DAC and its members can provide input is in developing common donor approaches and enhancing bilateral donor efforts to build trade capacity in developing countries.         We are very much aware of the Integrated Framework for least developed countries' trade development and we maintain close contact with the co-ordinators from the different multilateral organisations involved.         Since 1997 we have organised two workshops in Paris on the subject of capacity development for trade in which we invited representatives of all six organisations, and we contributed a report to the WTO High Level Meeting in 1997 on the activities of bilateral donors in this area.          The stress given in the Integrated Framework to demand-led and locally owned approaches is fully in line with the orientations reflected in the DAC’s Development Partnership Strategy.          Given the importance of trade and development linkages, many bilateral donors are now striving to be more effective in their efforts to help the less advanced developing countries strengthen capacity to trade. The lessons we have learned from experience so far suggest strongly that successful trade development must consist of a concerted, multi-faceted approach that targets numerous actors, institutions and processes at the same time in an integrated and comprehensive manner.         This is not an easy approach when it comes to the level of operationalising it in the field.          We are therefore embarking on a project to prepare a set of good practices for donors in this area. In May of next year we will hold another workshop with representatives from the public and private sector in partner countries to test the good practices before they are finalised and disseminated at the end of next year.         Lessons learned from technical co-operation generally point to two critically important points.          First, donors need to tailor their strategies to the specific needs of the particular developing countries. Systemic needs assessments undertaken by the partner country in co-operation with the private sector must be the point of departure. Such assessments must be much more than shopping lists. They must embody the country’s own vision of how it can insert itself into market-driven, client-oriented patterns of trade in goods and services where value-added retained in the country is high.         This implies a significant agenda of policy development and institution building and an intensive dialogue between the Government and the private sector. It involves a heavy initial investment of time and effort, but ownership is essential for lasting impact.          DAC work in capacity building generally provides important guidance, including on strengthening the participation of the private sector and civil society in developing countries. Here is a fundamental point, the wealth of nations is built not on natural resources or cheap labour, but on institutional development which provides the framework of accountable and effective governance in both the public and private sectors, so that enterprise and human and social development can flourish on a sustainable basis. Technical assistance for trade capacity building thus goes well beyond the capacities needed to participate in the WTO.         Second, a locally owned, needs based approach requires a shared agenda and good co-ordination at the country level. This can be facilitated by designation of a lead donor or                                                                                    WT/COMTD/M/27                                                                                           Page 13 multilateral agency with a strong local presence and a comprehensive understanding of local institutions and policy issues. We cannot stress too strongly that donor efforts need to be more focused and coherent within each developing country. This requires real long-term commitment on both sides, appropriate expertise and the cultivation of a ""learning as you go"" culture rather than the delivery of pre-cooked generic packages. Our good practices will focus on this need for coherent and co-ordinated approaches keyed to specific country contexts.         We look forward to the participation of the relevant multilateral agencies and policymakers and other actors in developing countries as we elaborate these good practices.          I believe that my presence here today symbolises the emergence of a more systematic process of interaction between the trade community and the development co-operation community. We need to work at this interaction, it has to be a dynamic evolving process that we discuss and evaluate regularly.         Today we are in sense verifying that we are all attaching the same priority to the need for policy coherence in both developed and developing countries and to the role of trade capacity building. These are key building blocks for the future of a well-functioning global economy in which all countries can take part.                                              __________","WTCOMTDM27.pdf","Committee, Jean, Claude, Faure, Chairman, OECD, Development, Assistance, Committee, Committee, on, Trade, and, Development, Ambassador, Diallo, WTO, Committee, on, Trade, and, Development, Chairman, OECD, Committee, OECD, Chairman, Development, Assistance, Committee, DAC, DAC, OECD, Member, Member, OECD, Member, OECD, Organisation, OECD, Committee, DAC, Committee, UNDP, World, Bank, IMF, DAC, Washington, World, Bank, IMF, Director, IMF, M., Camdessus, UN, Conference, WTO, OECD, OECD, Council, OECD, DAC, Uruguay, Cologne, OECD, OECD, OECD, DAC, OECD, OECD, Paris, WTO, IMF, World, Bank, OECD, OECD, OECD, OECD, Members, DAC, Trade, Committee, Seattle, DAC, Member, Members, OECD, DAC, WTO, DAC, Paris, WTO, Integrated, Framework, DAC, DAC, WTO"

He said that the priority was now to de-politicise and rationally analyse the topic, as was done in the Secretariat document, and to analyse and focus on those provisions for special and differential treatment which held out the promise of strengthening the integration of targeted WTO Members into the multilateral trading system. He said that many would probably agree that it was not the goal of special and differential treatment to set aside WTO rules for most of its Members. It was necessary to recognise that there were problems which lay beyond the reach of special and differential treatment and which needed to be addressed by means other than the use of special and differential treatment. What was needed now was an efficient structure that could deal with special and differential treatment without being side-tracked by political statements and political counter-statements.","WTCOMTDM28.pdf","Switzerland, WTO, Secretariat, WTO, Members, WTO, Members"
"2339",2339,"22","22.     The representative of the European Communities said that the WT/COMTD/W/66 document was a useful stock-taking exercise. She said the Seminar on Special and Differential Treatment was of great value, adding that special and differential treatment was a very important component of the multilateral trading system, and that it was timely to ask questions about its future role in the WT/COMTD/M/28 Page 4 multilateral trading system. Her delegation welcomed the presence of academics and other specialists as this had lifted the debate from short-term concerns to long-term systemic issues. She highlighted two inter-linked questions, namely, the value of preferential access as a form of special and differential treatment, and, second, the role of technical assistance, and pointed to the complementarity of these two forms of special and differential treatment. Technical assistance was an integral part of special and differential treatment, and this was reflected in the fact that a number of specific agreements referred to the delivery of technical assistance. She said that there was little value in establishing priorities between different types of special and differential treatment, and that it seemed clear from the debate that different developing countries would take advantage of different types of special and differential treatment, depending on their level of development, the composition of their exports, and so on. The conclusion was that while all forms of special and differential treatment were important, they could not be expected to have the same impact or work in the same way for every single country. She said that another concept which had arisen from the discussions held in the Seminar was the degree of differentiation between developing countries. While the creation of new categories would create more problems than it would solve, it was necessary to take into account the fact that differences existed and, therefore, without formalising different categories, to consider each country on its own merits, as was done with needs assessments in the Integrated Framework (IF) and in the case of technical assistance for implementation. She recalled the approach the EC had put forward for capacity-building, namely that capacity-building should be made operational through, for example, a menu approach when new obligations were involved, and through a step-by-step approach. Finally, if it were true that all forms of special and differential treatment were available and differentiation was an element to take into account, the question arose as to whether this needed to be taken as a ""still-life feature"". As had been pointed out in the seminar by the representative of the EC, the objective of special and differential treatment was to further the integration of Members into the trading system, and, hence, if special and differential treatment was to be beneficial, it needed to be set within a time-limited period, so that one did not end up with a two-tier system of rules.","WTCOMTDM28.pdf","European, Communities, EC, EC, Members"
"2340",2340,"23","23.      The representative of India said that the Secretariat document WT/COMTD/W/66 was a useful input into discussions relating to special and differential treatment. He noted the concerns that had been stated about the lack of response to the questionnaires, and recalled that, at the time the questionnaire was circulated, many developing countries had been involved in the process of putting forward their views on a whole range of implementation issues in the General Council preparatory process for Seattle. He said it would be useful to take account of the ideas that had been put forward in the preparatory process in the CTD's discussion on special and differential treatment. He said that the Seminar on Special and Differential Treatment had been of great benefit, primarily because discussions had not been solely theoretical but had also had a practical focus. Referring to the comments made the EC on technical assistance and differentiation, he said that while nobody in the Seminar had questioned the role of technical assistance in building capacity, many had stated that technical assistance activities had to be carried out in parallel, and not as a substitute, to other responses to problems that developing countries had been facing in the implementation of WTO Agreements. Regarding the issue of differentiation and adopting a case-by-case approach, he said that while this was possibly valid in the context of bilateral technical assistance, it could not be incorporated into the whole gamut of special and differential treatment, as provisions for special and differential treatment had been accepted as universal, and it had been clearly stated that they needed to remain so. He said that the Seminar had helped to focus on the three most important points pertaining to special and differential treatment provisions, namely their applicability, their enforceability and their utility. Finally, he said that it was necessary to keep the issue of special and differential treatment on the agenda for the next meeting of the CTD, in order to build upon the work carried out in the Seminar, and to provide inputs into the broader work on implementation that was ongoing in the WTO.

The representative of Egypt said that the Secretariat document WT/COMTD/W/66 showed that the paper made available by Egypt in response to the questionnaire had been used (WT/COMTD/W/49), and his delegation was of the view that inputs made by several other delegations in the context of the CTD could also be used. His delegation encouraged other countries to provide written responses to the questionnaire. He said that the Seminar on Special and Differential Treatment had been the occasion for an interesting exchange of views, and that his delegation shared the views expressed by the chairperson regarding the problem of time constraints. He said that the sessions were too tight to allow for sufficient interaction between the floor and panelists. Future seminars needed to take into account these concerns. His delegation was of the view that further reflection should be held on the views expressed and that the topic of special and differential treatment should feature on the agenda of the next meeting. His delegation emphasised that the major concern regarding special and differential treatment provisions was that they had remained ""best endeavours"", which had led to an inability to determine the full scope of benefits that developing countries could reap from provisions for special and differential treatment. His delegation believed that one of the dimensions that needed to be addressed in the future was how to make special and differential treatment provisions legally binding, and he recalled that the point had been made in the Seminar that under these binding provisions, the advantages derived by developing countries needed to be negotiated so that the exact benefits from the provisions could be identified. He said that Egypt did not share the view that technical cooperation activities were part of special and differential treatment, as they addressed questions of capacity building and human-resource constraints in developing countries.","WTCOMTDM28.pdf","Egypt, Secretariat, Egypt, CTD, Egypt"
"2342",2342,"25","25.      The representative of Bangladesh said his delegation had benefited from the different papers that had been submitted in the Seminar, and notably the paper prepared by Mr. Kessie. The idea conveyed in this paper, namely that provisions for special and differential treatment had little legal enforceability, added an extra dimension to the debate. He said that, from the point of view of least- developed countries, the various elements of special and differential treatment, while in some instances, needing further refinement, discussion and negotiation, constituted a package that stood by itself, and which was a part of international development cooperation. He said that the least- developed countries gave very high priority to market access and technical assistance for capacity building. While issues pertaining to transition times, flexibility of commitments and non-reciprocity were discussed, the least-developed countries stood to gain most from rapid action by the international community in the fields of market access and technical assistance. On the issue of market access, the granting of unrestricted, bound, duty- and quota-free access for all products originating in least- developed countries would generate significant benefits to these countries, without causing significant losses to the trade of other countries. His delegation welcomed the statement made at the Seminar on Special and Differential treatment by the EC to the effect that they would provide duty-free access for 99 per cent of all products, and urged other members to join in the effort of improving market access conditions for least-developed countries. Finally, regarding technical assistance for capacity-building, Bangladesh was of the view that the IF was a central focus. The IF represented a commitment that had been made at the Singapore Ministerial and renewed at the Geneva Ministerial, and was intended to address critical issues of trade-related capacity. In the context of the IF, a number of least- developed countries had undertaken various activities, such as the preparation of needs assessment documentation, and in some cases the holding of Round Tables and the preparation of multi-year programmes of technical assistance. It was now up to the international community to translate the commitment undertaken in Singapore into concrete action.","WTCOMTDM28.pdf","Bangladesh, Kessie, EC, Bangladesh, Singapore, Geneva, Ministerial, Singapore"
"2343",2343,"26","26.      The representative of Senegal said that his delegation shared the views expressed by the Chairperson, in her report on the Seminar, regarding the problem of time-management. One solution was to reduce the number of speakers and topics discussed. His delegation was of the view that closer attention needed to be given to the selection of panelists, adding that the decision to simultaneously select Messrs. Benjelloun-Touimi, Narayanan, Abbot and Akram was – with all due respect to them - perhaps not the best option. On the other hand, his delegation noted with satisfaction the presence of, WT/COMTD/M/28 Page 6 and the presentations made by, UNCTAD and the South Centre. Regarding the use of external speakers and panelists, his delegation was of the view that there could be merit in drawing up a list of resource-persons which could be updated every year. His delegation was of the view that if the objective of the Seminar was to provide an occasion for the expression of a number of diverse opinions, then the Seminar had been a success. The views expressed had also enabled his delegation to gain a better understanding of the subject of special and differential treatment, though it regretted that it had not been possible to hear the views of those delegations which had submitted proposals in the preparatory process for Seattle. His delegation was of the view that though special and differential treatment provisions were on the whole vague, imprecise, and non-binding, they were of value to developing countries. Now that the concept of special and differential treatment had been confronted with the reality of implementation, the task remained to make sure the concept was made more precise and less vague. Much remained to be done for the views of different Members on special and differential treatment to converge, and his delegation did not share the point of view held by certain Members that all Members had equal obligations, and that any difference in means should be corrected by means of technical assistance. His delegation was of the view that special and differential treatment went hand in hand with differentiated responsibility.","WTCOMTDM28.pdf","Senegal, Chairperson, Benjelloun-Touimi, Narayanan, Abbot, Akram, UNCTAD, South, Centre, Seattle, Members, Members, Members"

The representative of Canada appreciated the approach taken by the Secretariat in document WT/COMTD/W/66 in compiling difficulties relating to the implementation of provisions for special and differential treatment, and encouraged the Secretariat to proceed further with this work by using submissions made by delegations as an input to the document, and further to use as an input the steps taken by Members to comply with provisions for special and differential treatment. Her delegation was of the view that special and differential treatment could be made more development-enhancing, and was interested in questions such as, ""Could special and differential treatment be an instrument for bringing trade to development, by opening markets, enhancing capacity and adapting rules to local circumstances?"" Her delegation was of the view that the Seminar on Special and Differential Treatment had provided much matter for further reflection, and shared the views expressed by the Chairperson that time-management was an issue that needed to be addressed.","WTCOMTDM28.pdf","Canada, Secretariat, Secretariat, Members, Chairperson"
"2345",2345,"28","28.      The representative of Cuba said the proceedings of the Seminar on Special and Differential Treatment were a valuable input into the work of the organisation. His delegation was of the view that technical assistance alone was insufficient to address the structural problems faced by developing countries, and that special and differential treatment was a fundamental pillar in international economic relations, given the gap between developed and developing countries. As pointed out by the representative of Canada, special and differential treatment and enhanced market access were able to strengthen the integration of developing countries into the world economy. Hence, special and differential treatment in the WTO Agreements should be given a binding character and, for certain provisions, clearer language and a clearer statement of objectives was required. As stated by the delegation of India, the recommendations made in the Seminar needed to be kept under review and be incorporated in the executive part of the work of the WTO.","WTCOMTDM28.pdf","Cuba, Canada, WTO, India, WTO"

The representative of the Philippines said his delegation had noted that a number of suggestions had been made as to how to build on proposals made in the preparatory process for Seattle and the deliberations of the Seminar. His delegation attempted to be somewhat more ambitious, in proposing the establishment of a working mechanism on special and differential treatment, as had been mentioned by the Swiss delegation. The purpose of this mechanism would be                                                                                     WT/COMTD/M/28                                                                                             Page 7 to process information, establish markers, and identify priorities. Issues dealt within this mechanism would be the applicability and enforceability of special and differential treatment; the differentiation between technical assistance and special and differential treatment; and the issue of specificity in both technical assistance and special and differential treatment. He said that the specificity of provisions relating to least-developed countries had been recognised in the Seminar, but that it was important to ensure the universality, applicability and enforceability of all special and differential treatment provisions relating to all other developing countries. Another issue that needed to be tackled was the reassessment of the WTO's technical assistance strategy, in terms of the delivery of technical assistance and its financial viability. The range and scope of demands for technical assistance which arose in the WTO pointed to the importance of good planning.","WTCOMTDM28.pdf","Philippines, Seattle, WTO, WTO"

The representative of Pakistan said that the Seminar had been useful and hoped that it would be possible to build on these views in terms of the applicability, enforceability and utility of special and differential provisions in the WTO's future work programme. His delegation was of the view that the document WT/COMTD/W/66 was very useful both in terms of its compilation of responses from delegations and its identification of difficulties. When read in conjunction with proposals made both in the preparatory process for Seattle and in the context of the General Council's work on implementation, it provided the basis for the resolution of a number of difficulties relating to special and differential treatment and the broader issue of implementation. His delegation was of the view that technical assistance on one hand, and special and differential treatment on the other were two separate entities which should not be muddled one with the other, though they could be mutually reinforcing. His delegation requested that the subject of special and differential treatment be kept on the agenda of the next meeting, as further work on the subject was required.","WTCOMTDM28.pdf","Pakistan, WTO, Seattle, General, Council"

The representative of the United States said her delegation shared the views expressed by the Chairperson and by other delegations concerning the Seminar on Special and Differential Treatment, particularly in regard to the fact that the Seminar had been the occasion for setting out a variety of views. Her delegation had however expected there to have been more time for interaction from the floor, and had come prepared to interact, but had not done so as it did not wish to interrupt the flow of the discussion. Her delegation was of the view that all Members would benefit from a further constructive examination of special and differential treatment, in particular of the specific provisions for special and differential treatment in individual agreements, and in the context of country-specific requirements. Her delegation agreed with the comments made by the EC regarding the nature of special and differential treatment, which had been corroborated by some of the presentations made in the Seminar. Her delegation agreed that capacity-building and technical assistance went, in some cases, hand-in-hand with provisions for special and differential treatment. She said that when special and differential treatment was examined in specific agreements, it was found that special and differential treatment was expressed in various forms, such as: transition times; particular circumstances when safeguard action might be taken; or in terms of technical cooperation and capacity building. The view of her delegation was that capacity building itself amounted to more than just technical assistance. She said that some ideas floated before and during Seattle had heightened the understanding of capacity building. Capacity building was not equivalent to technical assistance, and the concept of capacity-building that should be developed within the CTD included an identification, within the context of WTO Agreements, of how capacity could be addressed in the light of commitments undertaken by the country in question as well as in the light of requirements to strengthen the country's integration into the multilateral trading system. She recalled a paper submitted by the EC, during the preparatory process for Seattle, which called for capacity building issues to be addressed up-front. Given that negotiations on agriculture and services were underway, her delegation was committed to examine how capacity building could factor in an initial matter. She said that any provisions for special and differential treatment needed to be viewed as mechanisms that would help give effect to commitments that had been undertaken.

Her delegation was of the view that, as proposed by several other delegations, work on the subject should continue, drawing on material that was already available. She said that the questionnaire was still not complete, and the question needed to be asked as to whether there were difficulties and complications with the questionnaire, and that the Secretariat should investigate this matter. She said that the conclusions of the Seminar showed clearly that special and differential treatment was a factor in integration of developing countries into the multilateral trading system, and better mechanisms were needed to ensure that special and differential treatment yielded optimal results. Her delegation suggested that the Secretariat should present a strategy for better mechanisms for special and differential treatment on an agreement-by-agreement basis, in order to enhance the integration of developing countries into the multilateral trading system.","WTCOMTDM28.pdf","Panama, Members, Secretariat, Secretariat"

She said that the Secretariat document WT/COMTD/W/66 was useful as it contained responses to the questionnaire and a compilation of different implementation difficulties connected with WTO Agreements. Her delegation found that the Seminar was of great use, and it served to highlight the value of the totality of provisions for special and differential treatment. There were many lessons to be pondered, stemming from contributions from the floor and from panelists, and her delegation joined others in suggesting that the subject be kept on the agenda. She noted that in listening to this debate, all were agreed that a key objective of special and differential treatment was the full integration of Members into the multilateral trading system. It nevertheless appeared to her delegation that, unfortunately, such a goal was receding, and that the present situation was best characterised as a two-tier system of participation. It was therefore the view of her delegation that provisions for special and differential treatment needed to be dynamic and more responsive to the general and specific needs of developing countries.","WTCOMTDM28.pdf","Secretariat, WTO, Members"

He said that the representative of Senegal had pointed out how this problem could be overcome. He said that an examination of the list of speakers showed a disproportionate number of Geneva-based speakers, especially when compared to the number of academics and representatives of international organisations who actually had empirical evidence to back their view points. The whole point of a seminar was to allow the expression of independent view-points which would allow Members to make decisions, and not to have a re-run by ambassadors of country proposals with which everyone was familiar. He said this critique needed to be taken into account in the organisation of future seminars. Regarding the issues of special and differential treatment and technical assistance, he recalled that prior to Seattle, lengthy discussions had been held on technical cooperation, and notably the financing of technical assistance through the regular budget. He said that if technical assistance was to be considered a part of special and differential treatment, then, by extrapolation, its cost should be met by those who should provide it.","WTCOMTDM28.pdf","Kenya, Senegal, Members, Seattle"

The representative of Japan, responding to the question raised by the representative of Bolivia, said that provisions for special and differential treatment could be classified into different categories, as stated in document WT/COMTD/W/66.

"2355",2355,"37","37.      The representative of Saint Lucia said her delegation was of the view that the need to review provisions for special and differential treatment was significant. She shared the views expressed by previous speakers, and in particular concurred with the views expressed by Switzerland on the need to de-politicise the treatment of special and differential treatment and to address issues in a systematic way. There seemed little evidence to suggest that the Uruguay Round Agreements had approached the various provisions for special and differential treatment in a systematic way, whether these were                                                                                     WT/COMTD/M/28                                                                                             Page 9 transition periods, flexibility provisions, best endeavour clauses, thresholds, and so forth, and there was insufficient evidence of logical and well reasoned approach to the rules. She said that for Saint Lucia the issue of differentiated treatment was not political but real. Saint Lucia's small size and vulnerability, dependency on commodity exports, lack of capacity and need for retraining to promote economic diversification, required flexible provisions for special and differential treatment sufficiently sensitive to the needs of countries like Saint Lucia. Referring to Aristotle's definition of justice, she said that the concepts of MFN and national treatment meant that equals were treated equally, and unequals unequally. The WTO should not shirk from the challenge of developing a multilateral trading system that offered something for all its Members. She said therefore that the Seminar should contribute to further work and research on the subject of special and differential treatment, with a view to achieving positive results.","WTCOMTDM28.pdf","Lucia, Switzerland, Uruguay, Saint, Lucia, Saint, Lucia, Saint, Lucia, Aristotle, MFN, WTO, Members"

The representative of Mauritius said his delegation shared the Chairperson's views about the problem of time constraints which hindered the interaction between delegates and participants in the Seminar, and requested that the Secretariat take this into account when organising seminars in the future. He said the ideas and views put forward in the Seminar had furthered the understanding of the concept of special and differential treatment. It should be possible to build on the views expressed to explore the applicability, enforceability and utility of special and differential provisions, keeping in mind the specificity of small and vulnerable Member countries. His delegation was of the view that the contributions of Members in the pre-Seattle process, as well as any other new contribution that may be made, should be taken into account in the context of further work. He said his delegation had argued that any multilateral agreement could not be static, but rather that provisions should be dynamic and responsive to changes. His delegation agreed that the issue of special and differential treatment needed to be de-politicised, though it did appear that, with regard to the question of enforceability, political will was needed to bring about a conclusion that was satisfactory to all.","WTCOMTDM28.pdf","Mauritius, Chairperson, Secretariat, Member, Members"

His delegation held the view that future discussion on the topic should not be diluted into political declarations. Nevertheless, it was important to recognise that the question of special and differential treatment did have many political connotations, as had been pointed out by other delegations which had stressed the need for political will to make such provisions enforceable, and that one could not divorce technical analysis from political factors.","WTCOMTDM28.pdf","Ecuador, Members"

The representative of Guatemala said that his delegation supported the view that, in future events, there be a greater degree of interaction between panelists and participants, especially given that there remained to be held two very important seminars in the context of the CTD's work programme for the year 2000. The Seminar had raised a number of important and relevant points for the future work of the CTD on special and differential treatment. He said that technical assistance was a priority and an important instrument for development for a country like Guatemala, but was not the only issue of importance. Technical assistance was a parallel mechanism to the work that needed to be done in generating development. He said that there existed differences in development between all countries: Guatemala was a small, developing country which faced constraints on its full integration into the multilateral trading system and full participation in its benefits. Finally, his WT/COMTD/M/28 Page 10 delegation supported others who said that the subject of special and differential treatment should be kept on the agenda of the CTD.","WTCOMTDM28.pdf","Guatemala, CTD, CTD, Guatemala, Guatemala, CTD"

The representative of Argentina said that that both the proceedings of the Seminar and the contents of document WT/COMTD/W/66 should form the basis of major work carried out by the CTD regarding the subject of special and differential treatment. His delegation joined others in asking for more time to be allocated for Members to interact with the ideas expressed by panelists. His delegation was particularly struck by statements made in the seminar which showed that the areas in which developing countries benefited from comparative advantage, particularly textiles and agriculture, were precisely those which had met difficulties in becoming integrated into the multilateral trading system over its 50 year history. His delegation supported the statements made by the delegations of Uruguay and Chile regarding the importance of market access; and when discussing market access, one needed to bear in mind not only access to markets in developed countries, but also the question of competing with subsidised exports in traditional markets. He said that such questions needed to be addressed when attempting to ensure that all members participated in the international trading system under the equal conditions by which all countries were ensured access for their products with the same rules and disciplines.","WTCOMTDM28.pdf","Argentina, CTD, Members, Uruguay, Chile"
"2362",2362,"43","43.      The representative of India, referring to comments made about the need to differentiate between developing countries and the value of a case-by-case approach, said that when one considered Part IV of the GATT and the origins of special and differential treatment, two things became very clear. First, special and differential treatment was based on non-reciprocity, that is, developing countries were not required to pay for it; and, second, it was non-discriminatory, which was to say that there was to be no differentiation between developing countries, aside from the references to least-developed countries. These points needed to be borne in mind when speaking about the concept of special and differential treatment as it stood. If there was a desire to renegotiate special and differential treatment, that was a different matter. He also said that the question of whether technical assistance was part of special and differential treatment or not was perhaps somewhat academic. If one considered, for instance, Article 12 of the TBT Agreement, then clearly technical assistance did fall under special and differential treatment. However, if this was the case, then it was somewhat intriguing that there were calls to fund technical assistance from the core budget, while it was simultaneously being argued that technical assistance was part of special and differential treatment. Funding technical assistance from the core budget meant that all Members would pay for technical assistance, albeit in different amounts, and this was not consonant with the idea of special and differential treatment.","WTCOMTDM28.pdf","India, GATT, Members"

The representative of Guinea said that speakers at the Seminar on Special and Differential Treatment had all pointed out that the provisions for special and differential treatment in the WTO agreements had failed to generate any tangible benefits for developing countries, and speakers had also noted that there was a great degree of variation in levels of development amongst developing countries. Her delegation was of the view that the Seminar had been useful, and that further work should be done on the subject of special and differential treatment.","WTCOMTDM28.pdf","Guinea, WTO"

"2365",2365,"46","46.     The representative of Uganda said the Seminar had provided a welcome in-depth discussion of special and differential treatment, though the provision of added time for interaction with speakers would have been desirable. His delegation had noted the intervention made by the EC concerning the extension of duty-free market access to ""essentially all"" products, and hoped that in subsequent consultations it would be possible to clarify whether this formulation would actually provide new                                                                                      WT/COMTD/M/28                                                                                             Page 11 market access. His delegation also noted the presentation at the Seminar made by the representative of the IMF who had stated that the formulation ""essentially all"" may not amount to much. He said that technical assistance and capacity-building were of great importance to least-developed countries, adding that it was the understanding of his delegation that funding for technical assistance through the core budget would be additional to, and not a substitute for, voluntary contributions by donors. His delegation hoped that one would not begrudge the least-developed countries the targeting to their specific needs of the majority of voluntary contributions. His delegation was also of the view that capacity-building was not a substitute for enhanced market access.","WTCOMTDM28.pdf","Uganda, EC, IMF"
"2366",2366,"47","47.     The representative of Norway said that his delegation disagreed with the view that technical assistance was not a part of special and differential treatment, and referred to the relevant provisions of the TBT Agreement which the representative of India himself had cited. He said that the fact that technical assistance was part of special and differential treatment did not undermine the legitimacy of the proposal to increase the regular budget for technical assistance, and that this should be a collective responsibility. His delegation was of the view that provisions for special and differential treatment were an integral part of the provisions for all WTO Agreements, that technical assistance was part of that package, and that Members had a collective responsibility to finance technical assistance through the regular budget, though this was not to the exclusion of voluntary contributions.","WTCOMTDM28.pdf","Norway, India, WTO, Members"
"2367",2367,"48","48.       The representative of Canada said it would be a mistake to be overly concerned as to whether or not, technical assistance was part of special and differential treatment as this was largely an artificial question. It was, rather, more important to focus on the purpose of provisions for special and differential treatment. The focus of these provisions – especially those relating to transition periods – was to provide the time necessary to develop the required capacity to undertake commitments under different agreements, and it was in this context that capacity building came into play. Recalling the comments made at the Seminar made by the representative of the World Bank, the representative of Canada said that one could not consider special and differential treatment in isolation. Coherence amongst the policy and programmes of the various multilateral actors on the international scene was a matter of importance, and that it was particularly important to ensure that the WTO, the World Bank, the regional banks and donors work together more concretely to ensure complementarity in their policies and programmes, and to avoid contradiction and duplication. Recalling the comments made by the representative of India regarding the non-discriminatory nature of special and differential treatment, he said that he was doubtful whether the fact that there were developing country Members at various stages of development could ever be fully reflected in an organisation such as the WTO, which was a rules-based organisation. Such questions could be usefully addressed in other fora, such as the World Bank, and in terms of activities undertaken by donors. This meant that the trade agenda and the trade dimension needed to be brought to the development efforts made elsewhere, as the WTO was not a development organisation, nor did it need to be one. Members would do the WTO a disservice by focusing on whether technical assistance was part of special and differential treatment. Members negotiated whatever special and differential treatment was deemed necessary, and the focus for ensuring that special and differential provisions were effective lay in organisations other than the WTO.","WTCOMTDM28.pdf","Canada, World, Bank, Canada, WTO, World, Bank, India, Members, WTO, World, Bank, WTO, Members, WTO, Members, WTO"

The subject needed to be included on the agenda of the CTD in subsequent sessions. He said that Members should not be caught up in lengthy debates regarding whether special and differential treatment should be legally enforceable or not, but rather that the focus needed to be on solving the problems that had been identified in relation to special and differential treatment.","WTCOMTDM28.pdf","Ghana, CTD, Members"

"2370",2370,"50","50.     The representative of the Philippines said that the delegation of Canada appeared to assert the view that one could not a priori say that there could not be a different set of rules for developed and developing countries, and that therefore the rules always needed to be the same. The delegation of WT/COMTD/M/28 Page 12 Canada had also stated that the WTO was not a development organisation but a rules-based organisation. The representative of the Philippines said that his delegation had serious concerns regarding these statements, as they appeared to reflect a serious misunderstanding as to what the WTO was all about. The Explanatory Note to the Marrakesh Agreement did not consist of empty words: the Appellate Body had said that those notes gave ""colour, texture, and shading"" to the rules formulated. The Marrakesh Agreement stated that one of the objectives of the WTO Agreements was to ensure that developing countries, particularly the least-developed, had an equitable share in the growth of world trade. One could not, therefore, argue a priori as to whether rules should be equal or not equal. The issue was to ensure that the rules, however formulated, should be implemented; the objective of securing an equitable share in the growth of world trade for all Members: if this meant that differentiated treatment was required, then this should be put into place to ensure that the objective was attained. The Philippines was of the view therefore, that special and differential treatment was simply part of compliance with the Explanatory Note to the Marrakesh Agreement.","WTCOMTDM28.pdf","Philippines, Canada, Canada, WTO, Philippines, WTO, WTO, Members, Philippines"

She said there was no doubt these would also be fed into the processes going on in other WTO Bodies. However, this process of detailed debate on special and differential treatment was clearly not over, and the CTD would need to revert to it again in informal or formal meetings. In this context, she invited the Secretariat to formulate proposals on a follow up in practical and concrete terms, notably the proposal concerning a working mechanism on special and differential treatment. She suggested that further discussion on how to take up the subject be held under Agenda Item E on the work programme for this year.","WTCOMTDM28.pdf","Chairperson, WTO, CTD, Secretariat"

"2374",2374,"54","54.     The Director of the Development Division said that they had produced a new paper on the participation of developing countries in world trade, including recent developments in trade of LDCs. The last time that the subject-matter had been considered was in 1997, when the Secretariat had produced a document (WT/COMTD/W/31) just before the outset of the Asian and the broader financial crisis. That document had traced developments in developing countries' merchandise trade only in the 1990s, basically from 1991 to 1996. In the current period of recovery from the crisis, a broader and longer term approach had been adopted to study the matter, using three different perspectives: the very long-term perspective covering the entire fifty year period between 1948, the foundation of the GATT, and 1998, the last year for which full year figures were available; the perspective on the 1990s, from 1990 to 1998; and, lastly, a closer look at the effects of the financial crisis on developing countries' trade. A separate section treated developments in the trade of least-developed countries. He hoped that the paper brought out reasonably clearly the differing trends in developing countries' merchandise trade in these periods. It did not cover trade in services. It showed, for example, the uneven spread of trade development among regions and the relatively poor performance of commodity producers in general, compared to countries that had succeeded in transforming their economies towards the export of manufactures. The Secretariat had also examined the effects of the financial crisis on trade and the recovery process, which had begun, as far as they could trace it, in the first half of 1999. The recovery from the financial crisis was continuing and would need to be looked at again in one year's time to see its effects on developing countries' trade and future prospects.

"2375",2375,"55","55.      The representative of the United States said that they had examined the paper and found it to be a very useful contribution. The paper clearly highlighted that the circumstances surrounding each Member were unique. A variety of factors affected the economic situation of Members, such as domestic policies, natural resources, the degree of trade liberalization, the ability to reform and diversify, and global economic conditions. Equally important was the paper's identification that, historically, those economies that had become the most integrated had increased market access both regionally and globally and had made the right decisions on trade policy and other policy choices. Another significant point in the paper was that building capacity, resolving developmental bottlenecks and increasing investors' confidence were highly important for developing countries, in particular for least-developed countries. These points could also be applied to a number of other countries in the world and were not exclusive. It would be important for future studies to take into account other changes in the international arena such as in job markets, manufacturing or other sectors, with a view to identifying factors that contributed to development and could possibly help developing countries leapfrog to a more equitable position vis-à-vis developed countries. Electronic commerce was one such area where significant amount of work had been done and where there was a strong interface between trade and development, access to information technology and training, but it needed to be better targeted. To the extent that developing countries had access to the necessary elements, they could leap into this particular area of trade without having to go through to traditional stages of development. They took note of the comments made by the representative of the Secretariat that trade in services had not been taken into account in the study, however, it would be critical for developing countries to see how developing countries, in addition to enhancing their existing manufacturing bases and others, could take advantage of new sectors.","WTCOMTDM28.pdf","United, States, Member, Members, Secretariat"
"2376",2376,"56","56.      The representative of India said that the paper was factual and therefore not much could be said about it as facts could not be disputed. He hoped that more than a few delegations would participate in the discussion. According to the paper, in 1973 the share of international merchandise exports of developing countries was 20 per cent and had risen to 28 per cent in 1997, over a period of 24 years. However, developing countries had their largest share in 1948, with 33 per cent. It would be interesting to look at the reasons for the disappointing trend. It could be argued that the aim for developing countries was still to achieve the share of merchandise trade they had in 1948. One reason for the falling share was that knowledge industries and technology, which had contributed significantly to growth in certain countries, had largely bypassed developing countries. Secondly, the markets in the developed countries had not been very open in precisely those areas where developing countries had a competitive edge. Agriculture and textiles were obvious examples, but there could be others. The third reason, which was picked up both by the report and the representative of the United States, was that some countries had not managed their policy options well and had not liberalized or integrated enough. Moreover, developing countries, ranging from China to India to LDCs had had very different growth performances. The question needed to be posed as to why some among developing countries had done better than others. There were also some external factors, which were responsible for the poor statistics. There had been tremendous improvement in some developing countries but the global statistics were worrying. His delegation found the report extremely useful.","WTCOMTDM28.pdf","India, United, States, China, India, LDCs"
"2377",2377,"57","57.     The representative of Bangladesh said that the Secretariat report was very helpful. Speaking on behalf of LDCs and referring to paragraph 14 of the report on trade trends of least-developed countries, he said that they were very grateful that the Secretariat had made some very important comments based on reliable solid statistics. The report indicated that LDCs were by definition the weakest and the most vulnerable in their economic structures, further strengthening what LDCs had been saying all along. More importantly, the report said that LDCs' share of world trade had declined continuously between 1980-97 and that they had not enjoyed upswings as had some other developing countries. This fact strengthened the case for differentiated treatment for LDCs. In the same paragraph, his delegation had expected a comment on the current situation of LDCs, in terms of their performance vis-à-vis WTO obligations. He said that, speaking from the experience of Bangladesh and other LDCs, the LDCs as a group had performed well in respect of their WTO obligations, in the WT/COMTD/M/28 Page 14 context of derogations that were afforded to the LDCs as a group. The report would have had added weight had this fact been taken into account. He concluded by saying that though Bangladesh had been given extra marks for doing comparatively well, on the whole the results were worrying. It would be a shame for the international community to watch some countries get marginalized and dropped out of the scene although commitments had been made to help them on occasion.","WTCOMTDM28.pdf","Bangladesh, Secretariat, LDCs, Secretariat, LDCs, LDCs, WTO, Bangladesh, LDCs, WTO, Bangladesh"
"2378",2378,"58","58.     The representative of Switzerland said that the representative of India had raised some very important questions, one of which he would try to answer. The study had taken 1948 as the base year, which was possibly not the best year to take as global trade at the time was quite diverted or disturbed. The study showed the increased importance of South-South trade, which had unfortunately been shown in the negative context of decreasing trade shares. One could also look at the facts in a positive way and highlight the growth potential of South-South trade.","WTCOMTDM28.pdf","Switzerland, India"

She also stressed the fact that least-developed countries, by definition, were the disadvantaged. However, she said that a positive trend could be detected for the last 25 years. What was interesting was the change in the composition of international trade. In 1974-75 oil was a major component of developing country exports, whereas presently an increase in manufactured exports could be detected.","WTCOMTDM28.pdf","European, Communities, India"

"2381",2381,"60","60.     The representative of Uganda said that it was very clear from the statistics that the share of world trade for LDCs, particularly for those in Africa, had been declining. As highlighted in paragraphs 7 and 63, the other problematic aspect concerning especially African LDCs was the predominance of primary commodities as a major export item. Another factor, mentioned in paragraph 59, was the predominance of African exports to European Union countries, which highlighted the need for the waiver on the EC-ACP arrangements. There was a trend towards increasing African exports to Asian developing countries. As an example of South-South cooperation, he hoped this would be strengthened and deepened.","WTCOMTDM28.pdf","Uganda, Africa, European, Union"
"2382",2382,"61","61.      The representative of Jamaica was of the view that one of the most important statistics provided was the one indicating growth in merchandise exports over the past fifty years, which had increased by a factor of 69 for developing countries and by a factor of 100 for developed countries. Over time, merchandise exports of developed countries were in fact increasing at a faster rate than that of developing countries. Therefore, it could only be concluded that the gap between developed and developing countries was widening and not closing - an important conclusion to draw from the mass of data that they had been provided with. He thanked the Secretariat for the comprehensive and informative document. On the positive side, the share of manufactures in exports of developing countries, had risen from 4 per cent to 24 per cent between 1963 and 1998. If there was any correlation to be made, it was between growth in manufactures as a proportion of exports and rise in incomes and a more successful integration into the global economy. Still it needed to be placed in the right context. A small number of countries including China, which was not a WTO Member as yet, accounted for almost 70 per cent of the exports of manufactures from developing countries. Another positive development was the tendency towards stronger integration in terms of South-South trade. Particularly in Latin America, intra-regional trade in MERCOSUR and the Andean Community had grown by rates as high as 26 per cent per year between 1990-97. He did not believe that similar figures would have been applicable to some of the other regional arrangements in Latin America and the Caribbean, including CARICOM. Still, it was a healthy trend, reflective of efforts to strengthen South-South cooperation. The data also showed positive trends in the growth of imports from developed countries. Market access to developing countries appeared to be quite attainable for developed countries. In conclusion, there were some positive trends, but despite the best efforts of all concerned, there was in fact a widening of the gap.

The representative of Mauritius said that he shared the views expressed by the representatives of India and Jamaica and also agreed with the representative of Uganda on the question related to primary commodities. In the case of very small states, dependent on exports of commodities or traditional products, diversification might not be possible due to physical size and climate. On the other hand, these same products had helped the diversification in some countries into other sectors like tourism and textiles, and this process had been achieved prior to the signing of the Marrakesh Agreement.","WTCOMTDM28.pdf","Mauritius, India, Jamaica, Uganda"
"2384",2384,"63","63.     The representative of Japan thanked the Secretariat for having prepared an excellent, comprehensive note. Her delegation paid particular attention in the note to the fact that the LDC's share of world trade had declined from 0.9 per cent in 1980 to 0.5 per cent in 1997. This was partly due to their dependence on primary commodities. Among LDCs, the gap had become larger between those which exported manufactures and others. Her delegation was concerned that LDCs might be further marginalized as globalization progressed. In this regard they recognized the importance of various measures and assistance, including technical assistance, in favor of developing countries, in particular LDCs.","WTCOMTDM28.pdf","Japan, Secretariat, LDC"
"2385",2385,"64","64.      The representative of Cuba said that the participation of developing countries in world trade needed to be the centre of discussions in the CTD and that this subject was of utmost importance for his delegation. The objective was to see whether developing countries were actually progressing in their participation in world trade. Unfortunately, he had received the Secretariat document just that day and only in English, which was not very useful since his delegation worked in Spanish. He shared the views expressed by India, Bangladesh, and others that, as shown in Chart 1 on page 4, from 1948 and 1998, the share of developing countries in exports of manufactures had remained the same, meaning there had been no progress. He wondered what needed to be done to ensure that this would be changed. Paragraph 4 stated that those countries which were successful in the diversification of their economies were those which had gained more participation at the regional or national level. He wished that this matter be discussed in greater detail to be helpful for the future. Paragraph 11 stated that the developing countries which had been able to take advantage of liberalisation trends in the eighties and the nineties were also those whose development had progressed rapidly. This also needed further discussion, but he was waiting for comments from his capital. He agreed with the comments made by the representative of Uganda that the matter be taken up again in the future and supported the recommendation made by one delegation for the study to include developing countries' participation in international trade in services, which was a very significant sector in some economies.","WTCOMTDM28.pdf","Cuba, CTD, Secretariat, India, Bangladesh, Uganda"

She believed that the paper was an update on an earlier version that had been discussed earlier. At that point, her delegation had commented that it would be useful to analyse the effects of regional trade agreements on the trade of developing countries. The erosion of preferences for developing countries due to the elimination of tariffs among parties to regional trade agreements was certainly an important factor affecting the trade of developing countries. She took note of the explanation by the representative of the Secretariat that the focus of the update was more on the Asian financial crisis. They hoped that their comments would be taken into account when the paper was updated again in the future.","WTCOMTDM28.pdf","Hong, Kong, China, Secretariat, Secretariat"
"2387",2387,"66","66.     The representative of Kenya said that his observations would focus on Africa's performance in international trade. First, he noticed that Western Europe continued to be a major market for African exports, even if the share of exports going there had declined. He hoped that the ratification of the African Growth and Opportunity Act in the United States would help provide markets for African exports. Second, he noted some possible inconsistency between paragraphs 12 and 59, regarding the effects of the financial crisis on developing countries' trade. On the one hand, it was said that Africa and the Middle East were particularly affected by the decline in commodity prices. WT/COMTD/M/28 Page 16 On the other hand, there was an increase in the share of African exports going to Asia. He was of the view that this could possibly be attributed to African exports to countries that were not affected by the crisis, notably India and China. Thirdly, there was an increase in intra-African trade, which might be attributed to enhanced efforts on regional integration arrangements. He noted that the statistics were not coming out clearly because of the exclusion of South Africa, both on the import and export side. South Africa was a dominant and major partner in Africa both in terms of investment and trade. More accurate figures could be attained by including South Africa in African trade. Finally, regarding the predominance of primary commodities in African exports, as noted by the Ambassador of Uganda, he was not sure whether it could be explained through weak supply-side capacity or tariff escalation and tariff peaks.","WTCOMTDM28.pdf","Kenya, Africa, Western, Europe, United, States, Africa, Middle, East, Asia, India, China, South, Africa, South, Africa, Africa, South, Africa, Ambassador, Uganda"
"2388",2388,"67","67.     The observer from the Organisation of African Unity said that his Organisation also monitored trade and other economic data on Africa. The results reported in the paper were fully consistent with what they had been observing, namely, the declining volume and value of African exports, the absence of change in the composition and destination of African exports and the dependence on commodities. What was not captured in the paper - and was perhaps unnecessary given the focus of the paper - was that they were not seeing much of a reversal under the improved policy climate in the nineties. In response to economic reforms, positive growth rates had been seen in African economies, but the trade patterns had not been reversed. These observations again highlighted the urgent need for greater coherence in the policies of external partners towards Africa in dealing with issues such as the lack of investment response or the supply and capacity constraints.","WTCOMTDM28.pdf","Organisation, of, African, Unity, Organisation, Africa, Africa"

Referring to the question raised by India, he wondered why despite efforts, the benefits from liberalization were so small. There needed to be benefits for all Members. The representative of India was right in asking why some had gained more while efforts in the WTO were shared. These questions were even more pertinent since many countries were marginalized, limiting their capacities to implement the WTO Agreements let alone assume new obligations. There was a problem of credibility in the WTO, accompanying all the problems raised by India. Therefore, the CTD needed to continue consideration of the document at the next meeting.","WTCOMTDM28.pdf","Senegal, India, Members, India, WTO, WTO, WTO, India, CTD"

Those economies which had diversified had gained a greater share of international trade, while most economies that had remained tied to exports of raw materials and agricultural products had generally lagged behind. It was notable that the financial crisis had a proportionately greater effect on the trade among developing countries than on the trade between developing and developed countries. This highlighted the interdependence between developing countries and the benefits they could accrue through joint initiative and action. They welcomed further activity by the Secretariat to identify important lessons and/or best practices.","WTCOMTDM28.pdf","Australia, Secretariat, Secretariat"

He apologised to the francophone and hispanophone Members for the lack of translated documents. Referring to the comment made by the representative of Switzerland regarding South-South trade, he said that although it might not have been emphasized in the introduction, the sections on the structure of developing countries' trade and on regional developments included a lot of information on the different patterns and trends of South-South trade in Asia, Latin America and Africa. These could of course be analyzed more thoroughly next time. Referring to the comment made by the representative of Kenya about the apparent contradiction between paragraphs 12 and 59, he said that he did not see a contradiction. Paragraph 59 largely covered the expanding share of African exports to developing Asia in the period before the financial crisis, that is, up until 1997. The main effect of the financial crisis on Africa seemed to have been the decline in commodity prices, which had affected Africa's trade in a negative fashion.

The most recent discussion had taken place in its informal session on 21 January 2000, on the basis of an informal note by the Secretariat, entitled ""Illustrative List of Elements for a Possible Work Programme"". This note attempted to consolidate under four headings various matters previously raised by Members and which fell within the scope of the existing terms of reference of the Committee. These four broad headings were: special and differential treatment; technical co-operation; participation of developing countries in the multilateral trading system; and the experience of the developing countries with their own implementation and the implementation by their partners of the WTO Agreements. During discussions on the Illustrative List, Members indicated that the list was relatively comprehensive and ambitious, and it would be necessary to establish work priorities for 2000, without necessarily excluding any item of interest to Members. She said that in preparing the draft work programme, account was taken of items to which the Committee was already committed for 2000 or for which work has been requested.","WTCOMTDM28.pdf","Chairperson, Members, Secretariat, Zambia, CTD, Secretariat, Members, Committee, WTO, Members, Members, Committee"
"2396",2396,"74","74.      The Chairperson recalled that, beyond matters on the agenda of the 28th session, the CTD was already committed to an evaluation of the Technical Assistance programmes of the Secretariat. This process had already begun through the preparation of two reports, one of a more quantitative nature similar to last year, summarizing the activities that had taken place in 1999 and that were envisaged for 2000, and a second report identifying an approach which would permit the evaluation of technical cooperation, including training, in a more qualitative manner, to be presented at the same time. It was envisaged that these two reports would be discussed at the 29th Session of the CTD proposed for the week beginning 26 June 2000. It was also expected that the report on the review of the Integrated Framework for Trade-related Technical Assistance to Least-developed Countries would be presented to the Sub-Committee on the Least-developed Countries and the report on consideration in the Sub-committee would then be referred to the CTD later in the year, possibly at the 30th Session, for which the proposed date is 27 October 2000.","WTCOMTDM28.pdf","Chairperson, CTD, Secretariat, CTD, Integrated, Framework, for, Trade-related, Technical, Assistance, CTD"
"2397",2397,"75","75.      The Chairperson said that prior to the June meeting of the CTD, it may also be useful to have a seminar to discuss the problems of small economies, which was also on the Illustrative List. Considerable work had been done on this issue by the Commonwealth Secretariat and the World Bank, and by June it may be opportune to discuss the trade aspects of the issue. Such a seminar could be organized under the auspices of the CTD during the week of 26 June and a report provided for discussion in the CTD at its 29th Session. On the basis of discussions in the CTD and other bodies of the WTO, there also appeared to be considerable interest in the problems related to implementation of the WTO Agreements. If it was thought useful, it would also be possible to organize a seminar on this topic in the second half of 2000, to be followed by a report to the 30th Session of the CTD where the issue could be formally discussed. The idea was enter into specific details of implementation in the whole range of areas and discuss possible solutions to the difficulties WT/COMTD/M/28 Page 18 identified. Such a seminar was tentatively programmed for 23 October 2000. If desired, this could also be extended to cover other aspects of the participation of developing countries in world trade, and even capacity building, as indicated in the Illustrative List. The CTD also needed to adopt the annual report on its activities at the final formal meeting of the year. Prior to that meeting, the draft report might be discussed in an informal meeting which was proposed for 24 October 2000, just prior to the formal meeting. Although it was not formally part of the work of the CTD, the Director-General wished to hold another ""Geneva Week"" for non-resident Members in order to brief them on developments in the WTO and to facilitate their integration in the multilateral system. This was tentatively programmed for 16-20 October 2000, so that non-residents who so wish would be able to stay over for the meetings of the CTD and the implementation seminar in the week of 23 October 2000. (The arrangements for Geneva Week were be carried out by the staff of the Development Division and the Technical Co-operation Division). Other items on the Illustrative List could be addressed under Other Business, as required by dictates of urgency, or in the work programme for subsequent periods.","WTCOMTDM28.pdf","Chairperson, CTD, Commonwealth, Secretariat, World, Bank, CTD, CTD, CTD, WTO, WTO, CTD, CTD, CTD, Director-General, Members, WTO, CTD, Development, Division"
"2398",2398,"76","76.     The Chairperson suggested that for the consideration of this item, the meeting move into informal mode to allow for a frank exchange of views off the record. On the basis of discussions, the meeting could ask the Secretariat to make some revisions to the draft programme during the day so that a programme could be adopted later in the day, if possible. However, before switching to informal mode, the Chairperson opened the floor to the representative of Zambia to introduce his paper.","WTCOMTDM28.pdf","Chairperson, Secretariat, Chairperson, Zambia"
"2399",2399,"77","77.      The representative of Zambia recalled that under the previous agenda item, Members had discussed special and differential treatment, and its development or impact if used effectively. The Secretariat Report on the Participation of Developing Countries in International Trade had referred to the importance of building trade-related capacity as a key for improved trade, in particular for LDCs, and Members had expressed sympathy with the condition of the Developing Countries and LDCs. The question was, therefore, how to turn this sympathy into concrete and tangible results, for these countries to improve, qualitatively and quantitatively, their trading prospects and living conditions. He said that the proposal submitted by Zambia took Members one step from statements to suggested concrete measures. The essence of the Zambian proposal was to kick start the process of implementation of provisions related to technology transfer to developing countries (and particularly LDCs), which all members recognised to be at the heart of the process of integration though sustainable competitive advantage. He said that in order to compete effectively, products from developing countries needed technological content. However, technology transfer alone would not solve problems in this regard, and needed to be harmonised with capacity-building measures. He said that issues of special and differential treatment discussed in the seminar covered a broad spectrum of issues including technology transfer, and appeared in all aspects of WTO work. For all these reasons, Zambia wished to put technology transfer at the centre of WTO activities. The proposal envisaged that the WTO would need partner organisations such as those listed in the document that had been distributed. The proposal also assumed that implementation required a series of steps, such as: understanding what motivated technology owners to transfer technology; approaches to transfer of technology; incentives, and so forth. Implementation was not a one-off action, and each of the organisations listed could make a positive contribution and together, these organisations could create and deliver a mechanism linking technology owners to private sector owners. As to the procedure by which the proposal was to be handled, the representative of Zambia said that the CTD was an appropriate forum, particularly with a view to providing the political impetus. However, the ultimate and most appropriate forum was perhaps the TRIPs Council, and he informed Members that the same communication was being forwarded – with minor changes – to the TRIPs Council.","WTCOMTDM28.pdf","Zambia, Members, Secretariat, Participation, of, Developing, Countries, in, International, Trade, LDCs, Members, LDCs, Zambia, Members, WTO, Zambia, WTO, WTO, Zambia, CTD, Members"

"2403",2403,"80","80.      The representative of the United States said her delegation had reviewed the work plan submitted to January to Members, and said that her delegation's main concern was that the programme not be overloaded. The Secretariat had limited resources, and it was necessary to ensure that quality work was carried out in a timely fashion. In order to ensure that the work programme and the work products resulting there from were widely applicable and relevant to the discussions on-going in the organisation more broadly. For instance, her delegation was of the view that if there were issues raised concerning specific categories of developing countries, that similar consideration be given to other types of developing countries and given similar attention in the CTD as proposals raised by those concerned. On the issue of electronic commerce, the work plan was generated by the General Council, which had yet to respond to the reports submitted by the CTD and other bodies. While her delegation supported continued work on electronic commerce in the CTD, Members needed to be sensitive to proposals emanating from the General Council on this subject, in order to ensure that work that took place in the CTD facilitated the organisation of the work programme on electronic commerce, to be undertaken in May. Regarding the proposed schedule of seminars, her delegation needed to refer this matter to its capital, especially in relation to items scheduled from June onwards, and she hoped that feedback from capital would come expeditiously. Her delegation could not thus in the immediate go along with the schedule as proposed for the various seminars, though her delegation had no problem in principle with the seminars as an approach to deal with issues listed in the work programme. Her delegation could go along with the work programme, provided that various issues were managed in accordance with the resources of the Secretariat and with their the attention that they merited. The representative of the United States did not wish a return of the situation which had occurred with the Seminar on Special and Differential Treatment, where her hands had been tied whilst awaiting feedback from her capital, and her aim was to forward the proposed work programme to her capital to obtain feedback both regarding the dates and the contents of the various seminars.","WTCOMTDM28.pdf","United, States, Members, Secretariat, CTD, General, Council, CTD, CTD, Members, General, Council, CTD, Secretariat, United, States"

The Director of the Development Division addressed the questions raised by some delegations regarding the timing of the 30th Session and other events taking place in October such as Geneva Week. He noted that October was a busy month, because it included meetings of Trade and Development Board of the UNCTAD, the final WTO General Council in which annual reports were to be delivered, and so forth. He therefore requested that the date of 27 October 2000 for the 30th Session be treated as indicative, whilst adding that the dates were reasonably accurate. He added that good note had been taken of the request made by Gabon regarding the Social Summit.","WTCOMTDM28.pdf","Director, Development, Division, Geneva, Week, Trade, and, Development, Board, UNCTAD, WTO, General, Council, Gabon"

She requested that the CTD accept and take note of the dates that had been put forward for the 29th and 30th sessions of the CTD, respectively 29 June and 27 October 2000. Regarding the other aspects of the work programme, the Secretariat would take into account the comments that had been made by Members. Regarding the seminars, she requested that the one delegation awaiting instructions from its capital make every effort to obtain direction from its capital in order to allow the CTD to fix the dates of the seminars by the end of the month of March 2000, and to allow the CTD to adopt its work programme for the year 2000 in its entirety.","WTCOMTDM28.pdf","Chairperson, CTD, CTD, Secretariat, Members, CTD, CTD"

"2409",2409,"86","86.      The representative of Norway said that Norway had notified its GSP scheme on 29 August 1995, and its notification was contained in WT/COMTD/N/6, which contained all regulations related to the Norwegian GSP scheme, including Rules of Origin provisions, product coverage lists and a country list. The present notification contained in WT/COMTD/N/6/Add.1 only contained new regulations concerning the origin of goods, and neither country lists nor product coverage was included.           He referred Members to paragraph 59(c) of the Document WT/COMTD/W/66, discussed under agenda item C, which contained a brief summary of Norway's GSP scheme, and which showed that Norway had a fairly liberal GSP scheme. He added that the Norwegian Parliament recently made some additional improvements to the GSP scheme which were not reflected in the present notification, as the modification had been made subsequent to the issue of the present notification in December 1999. The amendments were all improvements, and would be reflected in a further addendum submitted to the CTD. The first of these improvements was a substantial reduction in exceptions in product areas such as textiles, clothing and footwear. Second, country specific exceptions relating to Hong Kong, China; Macao, China; and South Korea had been lifted. The third improvement was with regard to countries eligible for GSP treatment, with the re-inclusion of Iran, which had been suspended for some years. The representative of Norway said that the second addendum to WT/COMTD/N/6 which would be circulated would cover all regulations related to the Norwegian GSP scheme, including product coverage and country lists.","WTCOMTDM28.pdf","Norway, Norway, Members, Norway, Norway, Parliament, CTD, Hong, Kong, China, Macao, China, South, Korea, GSP, Iran, Norway"

The representative of the Philippines expressed the appreciation of the Philippines to Norway in respect of its implementation of preferential market access through the GSP. He sought clarification as to the definition of ""GSP Country"" as referred to in Paragraph 12 of Chapter 1, which said that a GSP country "" refered to those beneficiary developing countries and territories, including at any given time, the list of countries published by the Norwegian customs authorities"".

He said that it was proper for all Members having a GSP scheme to inform the CTD about their respective GSP systems and modifications to it. In order to ensure coherence and consistency it would be necessary to examine at the start of each year what changes had been made to GSP schemes. He requested that a copy of the notification by Norway be sent to the UNCTAD.","WTCOMTDM28.pdf","Mexico, Norway, Members, CTD, GSP, Norway, UNCTAD"
"2412",2412,"89","89.      The representative of Sri Lanka thanked the delegation of Norway for its notifications, and placed on record the appreciation of her delegation to the transparency this exercise generated. Her delegation had some preliminary questions. She recalled the Norwegian Scheme notified in 1995 did not recognise the principle of donor-country content rule, while Chapter 2 Section 2, appeared to identify the donor-country content rule. Further elaboration was required as to how the rule was to be effected, as it was known that other countries maintained a restricted list when applying the donor- country content rule. Regarding Section 4 which dealt with sufficiently worked or processed products, she said that there appeared to be a typographical error in the 2nd sentence of the 3rd paragraph which refered to a value of 5 percent, which was a very low level of value, whereas it should probably have read 35 or 50 percent. Regarding products not wholly obtained, her delegation had some concerns about rigidities in rules of origin, especially with regard to chapters 50 to 63 where many developing countries had comparative advantage. Regarding Section 6 on regional cumulation of origin, she requested clarification as to what regional groupings had been recognised under this section. On Section 11 regarding derogations, her delegation wished to flag the fact that                                                                                      WT/COMTD/M/28                                                                                             Page 21 waiving rules of origin of for certain groups of countries, while having some justification, could also lead to practices such as anti-circumvention.","WTCOMTDM28.pdf","Sri, Lanka, Norway"

The representative of Norway responded to the question raised by the Philippines regarding criteria for inclusion in or exclusion from the list of beneficiary countries, and said that with very few exceptions, all developing countries and LDCs were on the list, regardless of their Membership status with the WTO. There were certain exceptions – such as Iran which, as he had stated earlier, had just been re-instated to the list – but these were limited to just one or two. Regarding the question raised by Mexico, he said that the present notification had also been submitted to the UNCTAD.

The objective was to explore different facets of special and differential treatment (S&D), outside of a negotiating context, and outside of a formal session of the CTD in order both to allow a frank exchange of views on the issue and to provide an input into the Committee's consideration of the question. Background material included WTO documents, material provided by other organizations and papers prepared by some panelists. A copy of the programme is attached.          The seminar was divided into six sessions: on the overview of S&D provisions in the WTO and their objectives; on the role of GSP and other preferences; on the function of technical assistance as an element in S&D; on the implementation of S&D under the main WTO Agreements; on the relationship between S&D treatment and developing country reforms; and finally, on the future of special and differential treatment.         During the first session, the panelists discussed the origins of S&D provisions and their evolution since the introduction of the first such provision in 1955. Waivers for non-reciprocal trading arrangements (e.g. Lomé, CBI, etc.), Generalized System of Trade Preferences (GSP), and the Enabling Clause were highlighted as having been some of the main initiatives over the years. It was pointed out that there had been a shift in attitudes towards S&D over time, especially between the Tokyo and the Uruguay Rounds. Some argued that the realization that S&D had not yielded many tangible results had led developing countries to accept a dilution of S&D provisions in return for improved market access to developed country markets. Others claimed that since existing S&D provisions were not legally enforceable and had not been properly put into effect, it was not possible         1             Job No. 1554. WT/COMTD/M/28/Add.1 Page 2 to determine whether S&D as a concept had succeeded or failed. In addition, it was argued, many possible S&D benefits had been outweighed by losses due to protectionist arrangements of developed countries in the agriculture and textiles sectors. Any evaluation or rethinking of S&D provisions needed to be addressed in its historical and political context, rather than in a purely legalistic manner. Apart from a discussion of existing S&D provisions, some called for new arrangements for small and vulnerable economies.          In the second session, it was argued that given the large and widening disparities in income levels between developed and developing economies and the higher levels of protection that still existed on items of export interest to the developing countries, GSP as well as other forms of preferential trade arrangements were still of major importance. In 1997 about $100 billion worth of imports into developed countries had benefitted from GSP schemes while levels of domestic and foreign direct investment in developing countries had in many regions remained insufficient to spur growth. Problems with GSP included the gradual erosion of preferences due to overall tariff liberalization as well as the complexity and unpredictability of the country schemes. Measures such as extending the scope of the schemes, relaxing their rules of origin, and complementing them with other supply-side policies were mentioned as means of improving the functioning of GSP. There was a clear trend towards reciprocal preferential trading arrangements between developed countries and developing countries and non-reciprocal ones between developed countries and LDCs. GSP would remain attractive for those countries which were not covered by these other schemes. Some participants in the seminar pointed out that one should not to be misled by aggregate results and figures but rather focus on particular needs of countries at different levels of development. For example, it was not LDCs but rather middle-income countries that stood to gain from GSP.         The third session opened with a review of the technical assistance (TA) activities of the WTO, which had expanded considerably since 1995 (from 79 activities in 1995 to 382 in 1999), and 90 per cent of which were now financed through extra-budgetary contributions. Not only had the number of activities per year increased but also the diversity of the subjects covered. Modes of assistance had varied from traditional national or regional seminars and workshops to more recent courses using IT-based training instruments. It was a commonly held view that the upcoming review of the technical assistance programme needed to address two main issues to enhance effectiveness: developing a coherent and systematic approach and securing a more predictable and sustainable financial base. Some participants in the seminar proposed that networks of regional groups, as well as contributions from recipient countries within the limits of their resources, could be used to facilitate TA activities. It was pointed out that TA was the least controversial of all S&D measures as it did not require any trade preferences or concessions. The objective was to assist developing countries in the implementation of the agreements they had already signed on to. Some argued that ""soft"" TA needed to be complemented by ""hard"" modes of assistance, such as trade-related infrastructure support. The Integrated Framework, which was meant to address some of these concerns, still had conceptual as well as coordination problems.          In the fourth session, it was stressed that, with the introduction of new rules for world trade under the Uruguay Round Agreements, the nature of S&D provisions had changed - from an emphasis on preferential market access and non-reciprocity to a greater focus on transition periods, transfer of technology, and capacity-building to assist developing countries in integration into the trading system. A number of participants said that S&D provisions must address, concretely, the difficulties faced by developing countries in integration - difficulties which might stem from such things as the size or trade sera of the country, administrative shortfalls including availability of trained personnel, or sectoral constraints. It was also argued that developing countries, being heterogeneous, did not necessarily fall into clearcut groups and that similar problems might overlap currently accepted categories of developing countries. Some participants also emphasised that, if S&D provisions were to be of value, they should be expressed in legally binding commitments, rather than in ambiguous terms as at present.                                                                                WT/COMTD/M/28/Add.1                                                                                             Page 3          In the fifth session, differing views on the adjustment process were expressed. On the one hand, economic reform and adjustment were necessary, essential conditions for economic growth and for successful integration into the world economy. It was suggested that S&D provisions had been counterproductive to the extent that they had delayed adjustment and encouraged the maintenance of policies that favoured the interests of narrow, special interest groups. On the other hand, others saw an need for policy flexibility in developing countries, given differences in economic conditions and endowments, as well as the existence of market failures that, in the absence of corrective action, could lead to misallocation of resources. Participants did not agree on the role of subsidies in the economy, whether as a spur to development or as a source of waste and inefficiency.          In the sixth and final session, some participants recalled the non-discriminatory basis of the multilateral trading system and recognized the tension between this principle and observed inequalities among WTO Members. Some believed that, rather than addressing these inequalities, the experience of S&D treatment was that it had increased them. Certain aspects of S&D, such as non-reciprocal preferences, had not been notably successful in all cases in promoting development and economic integration. The debate again turned around the questions of how S&D might be more closely calibrated to the situation of individual developing countries and how far policy flexibility could be a useful tool for promoting development. One major developed market Ambassador, as a panellist, outlined proposals that his delegation were considering for early action in the fields of market access for LDCs and capacity building for developing countries in general.

"2439",2439,"100","100.     He also stated that WTO's comparative advantage in technical assistance was its detailed knowledge of the different Agreements and provisions of the multilateral trading system. However, he also appreciated that WTO recognized the need to work with the other relevant organizations and bilateral donors to integrate trade-related technical assistance in general development projects and programmes. In the introduction of the 1999 report, reference was made to the two questionnaires for evaluation and to the production of an evaluation report. This gave the impression that one intended to integrate a summary of different technical cooperation activities with an evaluation of results obtained. Norway would have welcomed this approach and requested the Secretariat to ensure that next time similar information was prepared for the CTD. He noted with interest that, in the section on Services, certain comments on the utility of different types of technical assistance had been included. He agreed that it was necessary to secure regular and stable access to financial resources for Secretariat activities; in Norway's opinion, the best way to achieve this would be to make technical cooperation activities part of the regular budget of the WTO. This would not exclude voluntary contributions, but would relieve the reliance on ad hoc financing. In addition to the regular budget and voluntary contributions, outsourcing of activities was a possibility. He sought an update on Memoranda of Understandings (MOUs) that had been signed with other bodies.","WTCOMTDM29.pdf","WTO, WTO, Norway, Secretariat, CTD, Secretariat, Norway, WTO"
"2440",2440,"101","101.     The representative of Norway said that he was struck by the relatively low share of technical assistance activities covered by the Three-Year Plan. The high proportion of activities of an ad hoc nature complicated planning. To the extent possible, requests for technical assistance should be made well in advance. Norway agreed that technical assistance should be demand-driven, but also believed that the Secretariat should seek to apply a more pro-active policy by informing potential beneficiaries of the existence, objectives and modes of delivery of its technical cooperation activities. It was important that these activities should be seen in a comprehensive context by beneficiaries, and not undertaken in isolation from other capacity building efforts of a more general developmental nature.","WTCOMTDM29.pdf","Norway, Norway, Secretariat"

"2442",2442,"103","103.    The representative of Kenya noted that most technical activities concerning Kenya had been undertaken through JITAP. It is not by coincidence that the only activity outside this framework was funded by the Swedish Trust Fund, and Kenya appreciated this extra-budgetary contribution. Even if the WTO were to get the SwF10 million that it had been seeking before Seattle, there would still have been an element for extra-budgetary resources. He wondered what was the problem in trying to add the modest sum of SwF10 million for the regular budget.","WTCOMTDM29.pdf","Kenya, Kenya, Kenya, WTO, Seattle"

It would have been useful if there could have been some more detailed information for the Caribbean, as in the case of Asia and Pacific, on where some of the seminars and workshops had been held. She noted the importance of holding separate activities in the two sub-regions of the Caribbean on a linguistic basis. The CARICOM Secretariat was happy to work with the WTO Secretariat to organized workshops/seminars etc. in the region.

"2444",2444,"105","105.     The representative of Senegal said that the importance of technical assistance had been demonstrated as a very important activity of WTO. He noted the scope of activities directed towards Africa. However, this also showed a lack in technical cooperation activities, because African countries were the least integrated in the multilateral trading system. He hoped that the report would help in carrying out an exhaustive examination to reorient technical assistance to be more centered on implementation, so that all elements in connection with the different Agreements concerning special and differential treatment became compulsory. Precise indicators should be provided to show the progress achieved by developing countries in their integration into the multilateral trading system.","WTCOMTDM29.pdf","Senegal, WTO, Africa"

"2446",2446,"107","107.     Mr. Léger took note that some Members felt that the report was too quantitative in nature and not enough in terms of quality of activities conducted. A decision had been taken a few months earlier to separate the Evaluation Report (WT/COMTD/W/72) from the Annual Report (WT/COMTDW/70), The evaluation report was based on two questionnaires discussed in 1999 in the CTD, and follow-ups with numerous countries. Mr. H. Aboutahir of the Technical Cooperation Division (TCD) would present the interim evaluation report. Additional information on individual missions by mode of delivery and subject matter, and money spent, was available in the Secretariat database and could be provided. The Secretariat could also provide tables on person-month inputs for each mission and how much of this was outsourcing. Concerning internal coordination, he stated that each request received for a technical assistance mission went through the TCD. No request was signed until the cost associated with the mission had been identified and the necessary funding provided. Information was gathered on the destination, names of the official(s), the number of days and the objective of the mission. This information, available in the database in TCD, was updated on a daily basis. He took note that the Committee wished to see in 2001, before reviewing the activities for 2000, the Secretariat's specific strategy, objectives and priorities so that Members could compare these against the results. Regarding outsourcing, he noted that the WTO was negotiating a number of MOUs with other organizations, including UN regional commissions. MOUs with the ECA, ESCWA, ESCAP, and others, had as their objective to assist WTO in organizing regional seminars whereby the regional bodies would undertake responsibility for logistics and administrative matters.

"2447",2447,"108","108.     Introducing documents WT/COMTDW/72, W/73 and W/74, Mr. Aboutahir said that WT/COMTD/W73, in proposing a framework for evaluation of WTO technical assistance, put forward an approach and tool which the WTO Secretariat could use to assist and support the Committee in its evaluation and monitoring activities. The objectives of monitoring and evaluation were threefold: first, to evaluate the performance of technical assistance activities; second, to contribute to improving the content and format of technical assistance; and, third, to optimize the use of resources. The scope of the evaluation proposed by the framework related to: (i) individual activities, evaluated through questionnaires circulated to participants at the end of each event; (ii) regional projects and programmes in which WTO participated actively; (iii) specific topics, such as notifications or customs valuation, to evaluate for each subject the relevance of technical cooperation activities; and (iv) activities as a whole, where technical assistance could be assessed through their impact by region and by subject. The scope of monitoring and evaluation had three dimensions: the relevance of the activities, namely, whether or not they met the needs of beneficiaries and how WTO used its comparative advantage vis-à-vis other organizations; performance, particularly the effectiveness and efficiency of activities (reaching the best possible result with the least possible cost) and impact on beneficiaries, measured by indicators which should be identified in the planning phase. Mr. Aboutahir stated that the framework presented had suggested a number of concrete indicators relating to WTO's technical assistance activities. To give structure and analysis to this framework, it was proposed to use a matrix, as shown in the document. He emphasized that the process would only be successful when the direct beneficiaries of technical assistance as well as the donors are involved.","WTCOMTDM29.pdf","Aboutahir, WTO, WTO, Secretariat, Committee, WTO, WTO, Aboutahir, WTO"
"2448",2448,"109","109.    Document WT/COMTD/W/74, the Manual for Technical Cooperation, was a tool that could be used in the first stage in the process of monitoring and evaluation. The objective was to contribute to developing an evaluation culture in the Secretariat. Page 19 of the document contained a number of indicators directly connected to technical assistance objectives. The list was not exhaustive but was a set of examples, giving an indicative list of possible indicators, which could be elaborated in collaboration with beneficiaries.","WTCOMTDM29.pdf","Manual, for, Technical, Cooperation, Secretariat"

The Chairman said that, while it was true that discussions were on-going in the General Council regarding Observer Status, subsidiary bodies and committees had the authority to consider applications submitted to them. The CTD had agreed to admit, on and ad hoc basis, a number of participants. He therefore asked the representative of Israel whether his delegation had an objection to granting the League of Arab States ad hoc Observer Status to the CTD.","WTCOMTDM29.pdf","Chairman, General, Council, Observer, Status, CTD, Israel, CTD"
"2450",2450,"110","110.     Lastly, Mr. Aboutahir presented the interim evaluation report (WT/COMTD/W/72). This kind of interim evaluation of technical assistance was a first attempt. It should be further developed and improved following Members' suggestions at the meeting and through contacts with representatives of beneficiary countries in Geneva and in the capitals. The aim of the report was to provide the CTD with an evaluation of the relevance and performance of technical cooperation activities and to try to measure the impact of technical cooperation activities on beneficiaries. The report also proposed a number of recommendations aiming at improving the content and format of WTO's technical assistance. Mr. Aboutahir emphasized that all the information in the report reflected the opinions of beneficiaries both in their capitals and in Geneva on the technical cooperation activities conducted, and was also based on the questionnaires that participants fill out after each activity. As far as possible, the Secretariat had used the instruments proposed in document WT/COMTD/M/29 Page 20 WT/COMTD/W/73. In a number of cases, in particular on impact measurement, this report did not draw definite or final conclusions, because impact could only be measured over a long period, the evaluation process was in a very preliminary stage and a number of tools were just being developed. The methodology used was an analysis of documentation given by the technical assistance lecturer/official, as well as contacts with various officials from the Secretariat. At the second stage, field visits were made to beneficiary countries; the final stage was an analysis of questionnaires filled out by participants in technical assistance activities, by according to a random sampling, so that the questionnaires could be analysed in-depth.","WTCOMTDM29.pdf","Aboutahir, Members, Geneva, CTD, WTO, Aboutahir, Geneva, Secretariat, Secretariat"
"2451",2451,"111","111.    Mr. Aboutahir stated that, during the process of the interim evaluation, drawbacks were pointed out by a number of delegations particularly in terms of programming. Integrated programming should normally secure logical links between activities, clarify activities for a given period and identify the evaluation indicators and the basis for monitoring. At present, the implementation of technical assistance activities was basically carried out on an ad hoc basis. Concerning the content of activities, a number of fundamental elements appeared to be missing in the eyes of developing countries and economies in transition, such as evaluation of the use of funds and mechanisms. A full understanding of the WTO rules was not enough to ensure the possibilities of taking advantage of the WTO system; more emphasis should be put on practical means of applying the rules and mechanisms. In addition, it was suggested that technical assistance should provide greater support for a number of concrete and specific tasks; an example was the method of drafting laws and establishing technical regulations relating to a number of Agreements. New issues arising from the Singapore programme, and training in techniques of negotiation, should also have a place in the WTO's activities.","WTCOMTDM29.pdf","Aboutahir, WTO, WTO, Singapore, WTO"
"2452",2452,"112","112.    Mr. Aboutahir said that he had been told on repeated occasions that many developing countries, and particularly African countries, were not in a position to participate fully in the WTO system. They could not even manage better implementation without an ability to negotiate rules and without the possibility of participating in the decision-making process.","WTCOMTDM29.pdf","Aboutahir, WTO"
"2453",2453,"113","113.      Concerning training, it was noted that the ""training of trainers"" approach should certainly have priority because of its multiplier effect. This is an approach which most other international organizations use. It was suggested that WTO should try to set up trainers' networks in order to ensure a solid basis for the transfer of knowledge. The Secretariat was also told that in certain cases its training material was not well adapted to the needs of participants. Mr. Aboutahir suggested that WTO should consider dividing the content of this material into two or three levels so that participants can be better targeted.","WTCOMTDM29.pdf","WTO, Secretariat, Aboutahir, WTO"
"2454",2454,"114","114.    Use of WTO Reference Centres was reported as very high. However, approximately one-third of the Reference Centres were not operational for a whole set of reasons; for example, connection cost and a number of other reasons contained in the report. The assessment of impact had focused on Africa and revealed a number of positive indicators, namely better access to information and increased requests for detailed information after each activity. It appeared that the message was passing successfully. On-line contacts had also increased through the establishment of Reference Centres. There had been great interest on the part of African countries on participation in the WTO system, and particularly in technical cooperation activities with WTO. However, few participants could manipulate databases, a very important element if they were to negotiate new rules and take advantage of WTO systems. It was suggested that the Secretariat could do more in this area. Concerning the use of consultants, the Secretariat was told that it would be advisable to resort to national/regional competence alongside international experts. In this way, sometimes the message could be transmitted more rapidly and could sometimes contribute to efficiency and to the saving of resources.

"2455",2455,"115","115.     In conclusion, Mr. Aboutahir recalled that less than ten per cent of technical assistance activities were financed by the regular budget, with the other 90 per cent through voluntary contributions. On this inadequate and unforeseeable basis, technical cooperation activities will certainly continue to suffer on several fronts. The Secretariat was now trying to do better with its present means, but a more solid basis for financing would certainly help the Secretariat carry out improvements. A balance between the regular budget, extra-budgetary resources of Members, and resources from regional institutions should be encouraged. Several of the ideas contained in the report could not be fully implemented if human and financial resources were not put at the disposal of the Secretariat.","WTCOMTDM29.pdf","Aboutahir, Secretariat, Secretariat, Members, Secretariat"
"2456",2456,"116","116.    The representative of the United States appreciated the presentation, but recognized that document WT/COMTD/W/72 was an interim report. She asked whether the developing country Members who had participated in the interviews felt that it accurately reflected their views. She noticed that five countries were interviewed either in the capitals or at the Mission in Geneva. It was hard to tell whether some of the views expressed represented five or only some of the countries that were interviewed in Geneva, and therefore to get a clear idea quantitatively what views were represented in the report. She also asked if, in the context of perhaps the ""days of reflection"" or an informal discussion, a better idea could be gained from the individual countries of what they thought about the evaluation and its recommendations. She noted that in some areas there were very positive suggestions; but stated that her capital was not so sure of the level of objectivity. The vews of delegations that had contributed to the report would assist in assessing the objectivity of the report.","WTCOMTDM29.pdf","United, States, Members, Geneva, Geneva"
"2457",2457,"117","117.     Concerning WT/COMTD/W/73, the United States wholly supported the concept highlighted regarding the culture of evaluation and would like to see it elaborated further. Commenting on the technical mission feedback form, she noted that the second element spoke of whether or not objectives were met but did not ask what the objectives were. The United States considered that should come before the question of whether objectives were met. She also asked whether there was provision for advance written agreements between the Secretariat and the recipients on the needs, that is, the objectives of the assistance? The United States believed that such a process was vital, not only for the delivery of assistance, but also for the evaluation of its delivery and effectiveness. Concerning reporting to the Committee, she considered that the proposed process would convey information in a useful way. The United States might also like to elaborate further, during the ""Days of Reflection"" on some of the questionnaires that had been presented at this meeting.","WTCOMTDM29.pdf","United, States, United, States, Secretariat, United, States, Committee, United, States"
"2458",2458,"118","118.     The United States representative also noted that in the ""Days of Reflection"" her delegation would have more to say on bilateral technical cooperation, because, regardless of the sources of funding and other resources, when providing bilateral technical assistance, Members needed to have a full picture of resources available, not only those from the WTO, but also from recognized institutions that worked with the WTO. She cited U.S. funding for a WTO project in Egypt; the United States would document more thoroughly the different projects in which it was involved and the amounts it was spending, but this would not foreclose U.S. interests in contributing to the WTO Trust Fund and other relevant projects that came under the WTO itself.","WTCOMTDM29.pdf","United, States, Members, WTO, WTO, U.S., WTO, Egypt, United, States, U.S., WTO, Trust, Fund, WTO"
"2459",2459,"119","119.    The representative of Australia welcomed the Secretariat's report as a very useful evaluation of WTO's technical assistance activities. In particular, she noted the comments regarding the lack of technical cooperation activities in the area of negotiating techniques. She announced that Australia was funding a two-week trade negotiations training course for African members of the Commonwealth, scheduled to take place in South Africa in late July and early August. The recommendations and lessons set out on pages 19 and 20 of document WT/COMTD/W/72 appeared sound, providing a realistic ""shopping list"" of actions for the WTO to enhance the delivery of technical assistance. Australia particularly agreed on the need for an adequate and predictable funding base and strengthened cooperation and coordination with other relevant organizations. Australia also supported the use of local partners, initiatives to enhance the ""demand-driven"" approach WT/COMTD/M/29 Page 22 and the promotion of a culture of evaluation within the WTO and beneficiary countries. Australia considered that the documentation provided a good basis for careful reflection by the CTD on ways to strengthen the WTO's involvement in technical cooperation activities. It was important that the CTD should ensure full discussion of these issues and that appropriate follow-up action was initiated.","WTCOMTDM29.pdf","Australia, Secretariat, WTO, Australia, Commonwealth, South, Africa, WTO, Australia, Australia, WTO, Australia, CTD, WTO, CTD"
"2460",2460,"12","12.      The representative of Israel said that his delegation had no specific instructions and was therefore not in a position to join a consensus. He added that the League of Arab States sponsored activities that were against the core WTO principles of non-discrimination, and this was why Israel was not in a position to take a decision on the request made by the League of Arab States.","WTCOMTDM29.pdf","Israel, League, of, Arab, States, WTO, Israel, League, of, Arab, States"
"2461",2461,"120","120.    Two issues deserving more detailed consideration were, first, how to ensure the durability of technical cooperation activities and second, how to strengthen the synergies between the WTO's technical assistance and efforts taken by other organizations, bilateral donors and the beneficiary countries themselves to strengthen trade-related capacities. One should not underestimate the challenge involved in building stronger trade-related capacity in many developing countries, particularly the least developed, nor the time that this might take. A key factor might be enhancing domestic ownership through ensuring appropriate and adequately resourced domestic partners able to play an active role in identifying needs, helping design programmes and ensuring follow-up. Another important issue might be to recognize that short-term training programmes and missions might be of limited use if they were not adequately integrated into a longer-term strategic approach to developing capacity and appropriate skills. Three areas in which Australia was particularly interested were: how the WTO intended to enhance the effectiveness of its training packages, which currently were described as lacking an optimal pedagogical approach; how problems associated with the maintenance and use of the resource centres were being addressed; and the Secretariat's efforts to improve the programming of its activities. Australia would also be interested in advice on the training that WTO staff undergo in the use of the evaluation framework.","WTCOMTDM29.pdf","WTO, Australia, WTO, Secretariat, Australia, WTO"
"2462",2462,"121","121.     The representative of the European Communities, commenting on documents WT/COMTD/W/73 and W/74, said that on first reading, they seemed to reflect common sense. The EC would want their experts in the development field to look at the documents and might come back with more substantive comment at some stage. Commenting on WT/COMTD/W/72, he was happy that it was an interim evaluation report which could give a chance to take on board suggestions and comments by Members, to improve the document. He found the paper somewhat confusing: it was not clear where information ended and analysis began. He also found it confusing that the recommendations were spread out throughout the document, leading to a ""shopping list"" in which it was not very clear what the linkages were with the various parts of the analytical work of the report. Some streamlining could be done. He asked the Secretariat to shorten the report and bring it closer to WT/COMTD/W/73 and W/74. Commenting on some of the recommendations, he noted the emphasis laid on the question of negotiating techniques (point 10). He questioned whether this was a core WTO activity or whether it should be left to UNCTAD. Regarding point 12, he felt it was not clear what the ""involvement of the media"" mean in promoting the image and profile of WTO. Point 13 referred to the private sector and key players; he noted that there was a discussion of voluntary contributions from the private sector in progress. He would therefore suggest some caution in taking up such a recommendation at this point.","WTCOMTDM29.pdf","European, Communities, EC, Members, Secretariat, WTO, UNCTAD, WTO"
"2463",2463,"122","122.     The representative of Switzerland said that the interim evaluation report was a good start, even though greater focus on the evaluation would be necessary. There was too much emphasis on description and too little in terms of evaluation. In addition, he questioned whether lengthy explanations on the budgetary and financing problems belonged in such a report, even though they were important. Third, while nobody could deny that technical assistance was an integral part of WTO, it should not be the purpose of an evaluation report to state this. An evaluation report should look at the way actual technical assistance was provided, whether it was effective, and not on whether technical assistance was important or not. Although the interim report was a start, a lot more work was needed, certain problematic areas had to be singled out and evaluated more in depth and some general recommendations would have to be further worked on in order to allow improvement; for instance, the recommendation to strengthen cooperation with relevant international organizations. In a final report, areas where this could be feasible would have to be described, as well as the way such                                                                                      WT/COMTD/M/29                                                                                             Page 23 cooperation with other organizations could be carried out. He hoped that the ""Days of Reflection"" planned for mid-July would provide another opportunity to go more into details.","WTCOMTDM29.pdf","Switzerland, WTO"
"2464",2464,"123","123.     The representative of Switzerland suggested that, as a next step, areas of technical assistance could be singled out and evaluated in detail, for instance, technical assistance in the dispute settlement area. He suggested that for that purpose, dispute settlement could be regarded as a programme in itself and analysed with regards to its objectives, how success could be measured, positive points of the programme, weaknesses, plus, of course, detailed recommendations on how to improve the programme. Such a detailed evaluation could be an example for how to proceed in other areas of evaluation on technical assistance and how to improve the report as a whole.","WTCOMTDM29.pdf","Switzerland"
"2465",2465,"124","124.   The representative of Kenya noted that the document recognized the efforts made by developing countries toward meeting their obligations.

The observer from the Arab Maghreb Union noted that the reports were very well constructed and thanked the Secretariat for the establishment of a Reference Centre in the AMU Secretariat. Referring to the establishment of a regional focus centre, he suggested that this should be taken up on the basis of two elements: (i) training of trainers at the regional level;. (ii) participation in the logistics. He also supported the proposal by Egypt and others regarding the organization of regional seminars.","WTCOMTDM29.pdf","Arab, Maghreb, Union, Secretariat, AMU, Secretariat, Egypt"

"2469",2469,"128","128.     The representative of Zambia commenting on the Interim Evaluation Report on Technical Cooperation; said that the report was a good basis to engage in a qualitative discussion of developments and the performance of technical cooperation activities. It drew attention to positive aspects, as well as some short-comings that the Secretariat should address. The recommendations should contribute to making technical cooperation a better instrument for the integration of developing economies into the Multilateral Trading System. He suggested that technical cooperation should be reviewed and extended beyond its current form. This included not only WTO technical cooperation but also the whole context of technical cooperation in the area of trade and development undertaken by different organizations such as UNCTAD, UNDP and the World Bank. The WTO should exploit its comparative advantage, i.e its knowledge of the Multilateral Trade Agreements while improving its complementarity with the technical cooperation provided by other organizations such as UNCTAD. WTO technical cooperation should focus on giving support to the establishment of the legal and technical infrastructure required to fulfil the obligations and to take advantage of the rights embedded in the Agreements. He recalled that the WTO Decision on Measures in Favour of Least-Developed Countries stated that least-developed countries would be provided substantially increased technical assistance in the development, strengthening and diversification of their capacity for production and exports. In this regard, he commended the EC and U.S. for their support to technical assistance and two proposals on improving technical cooperation in WTO for capacity- building. While WTO technical cooperation targeted in the first place governments' capacity to participate in WTO activities and negotiations and to comply with the Multilateral Trade Agreements, the private sector was supposed to be targeted by ITC Technical Cooperation. He mentioned one aspect of technical cooperation for the private sector that current efforts did not include, namely, the private sector's interests in the Dispute Settlement Mechanism. He noted that technical cooperation WT/COMTD/M/29 Page 24 should be both a target and an instrument that ensures efficiency, credibility and ownership. Training of trainers and capacity-building of national institutions was critical. Local participation should also involve, for instance, the local media which needed to understand the challenges raised by participation in the WTO in order to disseminate accurate information to the public. A key issue was active involvement in the design and implementation of WTO technical cooperation. Technical cooperation could also provide support to the articulation between the regional trade agreements and multilateral rules. Donor assistance was invaluable to enhance the competitiveness of LDC economies by supporting enterprise development in particular by facilitating access to new technologies.","WTCOMTDM29.pdf","Zambia, Secretariat, WTO, UNCTAD, UNDP, World, Bank, WTO, UNCTAD, WTO, WTO, EC, U.S., WTO, WTO, WTO, ITC, Technical, Cooperation, WTO, WTO"
"2470",2470,"129","129.     Mr. Aboutahir, replying to the discussion concerning the U.S. intervention and the degree of objectivity in the sampling of opinion, recalled that the report's methodology was used by all international organizations, namely, in the first stage to study the documentation, and second to analyze questionnaires. The third element was field visits. The Secretariat had tried to visit a maximum number of countries allowed by its human and financial resources; five countries was a number acceptable in other methods of evaluation carried out in other Organizations. The conclusions drawn were to be approved by the Committee. He noted that a certain degree of subjectivity would always exist in any evaluation report, since the evaluator, whether in-house, or external, would give his opinion and his interpretation. He noted that, in preparation of the report, the Secretariat had contacted a small number of missions. It would not be possible to contact all permanent missions unless the CTD asked the Secretariat to do so. He agreed with the United States that there was room for improvement of the questionnaire on technical assistance; and that the objectives should be identified before saying whether they had been achieved or not. The Secretariat would make changes based on all the comments received.","WTCOMTDM29.pdf","Aboutahir, U.S., Secretariat, Committee, Secretariat, CTD, Secretariat, United, States, Secretariat"

The representative of the United States said that the request submitted by the Economic Wing of the League of Arab States was one that could meet her delegation's interest as far as the granting of ad hoc Observership was concerned. However, her delegation insisted on the right of Members to postpone consideration of requests for ad hoc Observership, and she hoped that by the time of the next meeting of the CTD, Members might be in a better position to deliberate on the economic content of application submitted by the League of Arab States.","WTCOMTDM29.pdf","United, States, Economic, Wing, of, the, League, of, Arab, States, Members, Observership, CTD, Members, League, of, Arab, States"
"2472",2472,"130","130.     Mr. Aboutahir also agreed with the Australian delegation regarding the way in which new training material and its pedagogical aspects should be introduced. Reflection would continue within the Technical Cooperation Division and with other Divisions in order to achieve better adaptation of this material. The idea was to adapt the material to the level of understanding and development of beneficiaries and to target groups, namely the final users of these training packages. He had noted the EC's comment concerning changes to the structure of the report. Future reports would be better targeted. An attempt would also be made to make them shorter. On the EC's question concerning substance and in particular regarding negotiation techniques, he agreed that this subject fell under the competence of UNCTAD. However, the WTO, while being neutral, had long and extensive experience in negotiating techniques. WTO also had databases that UNCTAD did not have, which could be of technical help to the developing countries helping them to negotiate better. One conclusion that could emerge was that UNCTAD and WTO should cooperate closely, each on the aspect where it had comparative advantage, to help developing countries to negotiate and thereby learn how to apply these negotiations to international trade and the WTO process. As for the private sector, the document suggested that there should be closer association of the private sector in the technical cooperation activities. From first responses, it was clear that the ""objectives and principles"" of the guidelines (WT/COMTD/8) should be also studied by the private sector, as a beneficiary.","WTCOMTDM29.pdf","Aboutahir, EC, EC, UNCTAD, WTO, WTO, UNCTAD, UNCTAD, WTO, WTO"
"2473",2473,"131","131.     Responding to Switzerland's comments relating to budgetary and financial aspects, Mr. Aboutahir noted that there were different ways of drawing up these reports; financial and budgetary aspects had been included to give a better in-depth evaluation of technical cooperation activities in relation to financing. If the CTD decided that financial aspects should not be included, the Secretariat would comply. He also said that the Secretariat would try to identify a specific programme every year, and make a more in-depth evaluation, if the CTD so decided. The Secretariat would take note of all the comments made by delegations.

"2474",2474,"132","132.     The representative of the Secretariat wished to correct an oversight in the report on training and offered, on behalf of the Secretariat, most sincere thanks to the Governments of Austria, Italy, Norway, Finland, Spain and Canada for having organized and hosted study tours for trainees. The study tour in Spain had just been completed and the one in Canada would take place in the fall of that year. He also thanked Switzerland for regularly hosting all groups of participants in Bern and for financing consultants for workshops on trade negotiating skills as well as courses for economies in transition. The summary account of the content of the courses found in the report gave a fair and accurate picture of the activities carried out during each course. He emphasized that the full programme was compulsory for the participants, although some flexibility could be applied in special circumstances. Much attention was devoted to the consistency and relevance of the programme as a whole. Delegations were not supposed to make use of trainees for official extra-curricular tasks and involve them in the regular activities of the WTO. In accordance with the internal rules of the fellowship programme, the trainees needed to devote all their official time to the courses. Starting with the previous course in 1999, a new feature of the selection process had been to include the economies in transition in the list of invited governments. For several years they had not been invited since they had benefited from the special six-week courses financed by Switzerland and the United States. As a result of the change in the type of assistance provided by the Swiss and US authorities, it was decided to include those beneficiary countries in the framework of the regular residential three-month courses. It had resulted in a much keener competition for the scarce number of fellowships each year. The implication for the countries involved was that they were subject to a different, less automatic selection process by the Secretariat as opposed to the one by the sponsoring countries in the earlier courses. Three years earlier, it had been decided to discontinue the practice of inviting applicants from the secretariats of regional organizations because of the large backlog of countries seeking participation in the courses. The only modification to that practice was that they allowed participation of self-financed candidates from those secretariats, thereby not depriving WTO Members or Observers of the few valuable fellowships. On course delivery and program assessment, the report described in some detail the delivery aspects of the courses as well as the efforts undertaken to assess their impact on the participants. They had completed in less than a year the preparation of a rather voluminous training manual. While the manual drew to a large extent from the Technical Cooperation Division's Training Package already available on the WTO Web-site, it had been complemented by reading lists represented in a user-friendly format. It was available in the three languages of the WTO and was distributed to all the course participants. Their intention was to make it available more generally, including on the WTO web-site, once the on-going in house verification had been completed. They hoped that it would provide a useful tool to delegations and capitals as well as to other interested readers. As to the follow-up and contact after the completion of the courses, the evaluation of the courses in Geneva was fairly advanced and elaborate. There was a need to improve the post-course evaluation by governments and participants themselves in capitals, which required closer cooperation from governments concerned. Their recent attempts in this regard had not yielded all the expected results. Indeed only about seventy percent of the ex-course participants' authorities had replied to their communication seeking to update their information as to the current location and job of their nationals. Information about assignments upon return and improvements back on the job would provide a better idea of the impact of the training received. They were thankful to those delegations which had submitted all the relevant information. They would be reviving, most likely in the autumn, the alumni association in Geneva. It was very comforting to the Secretariat to see so many ex-participants of the courses present in Geneva in various capacities. However, they were often unaware of others who had shared a common background with them and with whom they could exchange ideas in the framework of an alumni forum. The Secretariat would be contacting the ex-participants in the near future. Since mid-1999, up to 50 countries where Reference Centers had been installed had participated in the courses. Participants from those countries had been offered, as part of the curriculum, extensive computer training directly related to the use of the centers in their capital. A number of Reference Centers also WT/COMTD/M/29 Page 26 had a former participant in a training course as the person-in-charge. Updating the figures provided in the report on the total number of participants to the courses thus far, he said that the most recent figure was 1,757 (and not 1,702), including 90 self-financed auditors. Developing countries, least-developed countries and economies in transition shared the 144 fellowships and 36 auditor posts available over each two-year cycle, which guaranteed at least one fellowship to each applicant country or customs territory over that cycle. The proposal by the Director-General to double the training capacity would make it possible to ensure the same frequency of participation but over one-year cycles, instead of two, thus providing a meaningful improvement. This important initiative was being pursued by the Director General in the context of the preparation of the budget for 2001.","WTCOMTDM29.pdf","Secretariat, Secretariat, Austria, Italy, Norway, Finland, Spain, Canada, Spain, Canada, Switzerland, Bern, WTO, Switzerland, United, States, US, Secretariat, WTO, Members, Technical, Cooperation, Division, WTO, WTO, WTO, Geneva, Geneva, Secretariat, Geneva, Secretariat, Reference, Centers, Reference, Centers, Director-General, Director"

In fact, two officials were completing the most recent course in Spanish. They appreciated the fact that the Training Division was continuously updating and improving the curriculum in line with developments in the WTO. For example, that year training in agriculture and services sectors had been reinforced.. The follow-up to the courses was also very crucial as it gave the Secretariat an indication of which activities ex-participants were involved in. In responding to the WTO questionnaire, they had investigated and found out that in Chile many of the ex-participants, including one from the class of 1956, were working in the field of trade policy. Still, they had some comments and suggestions on how to improve the courses. There seemed to be a lack of coordination between similar activities undertaken at the WTO. For example, during the course of the latest three-month course in Spanish, there was a two-day seminar on GATS, an implementation seminar, and a dispute settlement course organized by the University of Geneva, in all of which the trade policy course participants could have participated. It might be a good idea to negotiate with the University of Geneva so that the participants could take advantage of the three-day course on dispute settlement. Study tours were regarded by some as superfluous trips, including touristic activities, which took away time from other activities and cost a significant amount. They wondered if the trips fulfilled the objectives of the courses and asked for a more detailed study regarding the effectiveness of the trips.","WTCOMTDM29.pdf","Chile, WTO, WTO, Secretariat, WTO, Chile, WTO, University, of, Geneva, University, of, Geneva"
"2476",2476,"134","134.     The representative of Venezuela wished to thank the Secretariat for the information presented, the details of which were provided in the comprehensive Secretariat Note on Training. The Days of Reflection would provide a good opportunity for further discussion. They appreciated the extraordinary support offered by the Secretariat in training activities. His delegation was one of the delegations that had benefitted from the courses regularly within the limits set for the equitable distribution of fellowships. In response to the Secretariat request to reply to a survey on where former participants of the courses were at the time, they had made an evaluation. It had shown that many of those officials had assumed important positions in trade policy decision-making and had participated in important trade negotiations, which demonstrated the importance of the courses offered. Still, the courses were not perfect and some improvements could be made. They needed to regularly take into account the changes taking place, not only in the framework of globalization, but also with respect to the requirements of the multilateral trade agreements. As the Secretariat Note stated, one of the fundamental objectives of the courses was to prepare officials for the administration of trade agreements. In addition, more attention needed to be paid to the level of knowledge and expertise of the participants. At times, there were junior officials in the courses along with officials which had experience in negotiations. It was important to ensure that the participants were of a similar level. Furthermore, the participants needed to come out with a strengthened conviction on the multilateral trading system and the liberalization process. They had noted that the dynamic of the courses was such that there was some discussion at the philosophical level, resulting in rhetorical conclusions about the utility of the multilateral trading system. It was important not to lose sight of the main objectives of the courses. Apart from being informed about the WTO Agreements, participants needed to be motivated about the importance of multilateral trade liberalization. At times, the participants entered too early into a philosophical discussion regarding the benefits of being signatories to multilateral trade agreements, before reaching a good understanding of what the process                                                                                   WT/COMTD/M/29                                                                                          Page 27 of trade liberalization meant and why the multilateral agreements were crucial for benefitting in the best manner possible from the process. With respect to the content of the courses, it was necessary to look at experiences elsewhere. In Venezuela, thanks to the support of the Secretariat, they had made an effort to see if they could succeed in having a multiplier effect to the WTO Trade Policy Courses through cooperation with a Venezuelan University. This could become a regular exercise where more universities would develop permanent modalities for training on WTO-related issues. Such an effort would help in overcoming difficulties arising from limitations on time and budget. Special training centres could be established in cooperation with important universities in all regions of the world in order to reach out to a wider audience. It would provide those in the government and in the private sector, who could not participate in the courses in Geneva, with an opportunity to learn about important WTO issues.","WTCOMTDM29.pdf","Venezuela, Secretariat, Secretariat, Secretariat, Secretariat, Secretariat, WTO, Venezuela, Secretariat, WTO, Trade, Policy, Courses, Venezuelan, University, Geneva, WTO"

They were glad to hear that the Director-General was trying to gather resources so that more opportunities would be available for training. On behalf of the LDCs and particularly of his country, he said that the differing needs of developing countries, LDCs and economies in transitions needed to be taken into account for a better allocation of resources. The fellowships needed to be awarded according to needs and not on a numerical basis. He suggested that training courses be held on the field as well. Some countries had fairly good institutes for their bureaucrats, providing training on various aspects of their internal governmental systems. If the faculty in those institutes were trained, they could in turn develop a module which could become part of the curriculum for the officials. Members as well as the Secretariat needed to insist on seeing that people who received training, either in Geneva or elsewhere, be posted in missions in Geneva. They were grateful to the countries which hosted study tours; however, the resources from donors could be better used for increasing the number of facilities and fellowships in Geneva for LDCs rather than for taking the participants out on short trips. He asked for clarification as to whether transition economies were benefitting from two channels of training, one through the trade policy courses and another through the training funded by the governments of the United States and Switzerland. He wondered whether separating the courses for LDCs and transition economies would be more useful for these two groups of countries. They appreciated the needs of transition economies; however, in view of the needs of LDCs, he asked that donors consider examining the whole situation so that money was well spent.","WTCOMTDM29.pdf","Bangladesh, Director-General, LDCs, Members, Secretariat, Geneva, Geneva, Geneva, United, States, Switzerland, LDCs"

Her country, which had been granted fellowships in the past, considered the Trade Policy Courses to be very useful and they looked forward to benefiting from the opportunity to participate in them in the future. She had taken note of the Secretariat commitment to offer at least one fellowship per Member or Observer over a two-year cycle. As a small economy, they had a significant need for technical assistance and their participation in capacity-building exercises, such as the trade policy course, contributed greatly to their economic development. Sometimes they found themselves in a dilemma: on the one hand, they needed to gain technical expertise; on the other hand, they experienced difficulties in releasing officials due to lack of human resources. Still, it did not mean that they were not going to take the fellowships they were offered. Regarding the diversity of trainees, she was of the view that the interaction between participants from developing countries and transition economies with different experiences, different origins could be very beneficial. However, the number of fellowships granted over a period of time should not be reduced as a result of the increase in the pool of invitees. The issue was related to the resources available in the budget.","WTCOMTDM29.pdf","Barbados, Secretariat, Secretariat, Member"

Most of her predecessors as well as herself had benefitted from them. It was her delegation's great concern that demand for the courses could not be met by the Secretariat. Extra-budgetary resources needed to be explored to allow for wider participation. Her delegation welcomed the decision of the Director-General to explore the possibility of obtaining more resources WT/COMTD/M/29 Page 28 for the endeavour. With regard to the study tours, she found them to be very useful as it provided practical insights to how a Member had been implementing the WTO agreements. Certain delegations had genuine concerns as the anticipated results might not have been reached due to the shortness of the programmes. But Members needed to give a second thought with regard to the termination of the study tours. Regarding course content, she was happy to hear that the Secretariat was establishing an alumni association, with which she wished to be associated. She would be happy to provide suggestions with regard to the improvement of the courses.","WTCOMTDM29.pdf","Sri, Lanka, Secretariat, Director-General, Member, WTO, Members, Secretariat"

The courses had always been beneficial for Turkish participants. They wished to see a continuation of the courses as well as their extension. The courses had not only provided practical knowledge about the WTO system but had also facilitated the opening of new horizons for better participation in world trade.","WTCOMTDM29.pdf","Turkey, Trade, Policy, Course, WTO, WTO, WTO"

The past evaluations of the programme were very positive. During the study tour in Canada, there would be sessions with the most knowledgeable trade policy officials in the federal government and also meetings with departments, other than foreign affairs and international trade, including the Department of Agriculture and the Canadian International Development Agency. There would also be visits to the private sector and meetings with representatives of two provincial governments. The programme did not allow for tourism activities, except for one day over the weekend. The study tours were meant to show participants how a specific country dealt with trade policy issues so that participants could observe concretely what they had learned. The Secretariat needed to make a thorough evaluation to ensure that money invested was providing a worthwhile experience. Her authorities would be interested in participating in the evaluation process.","WTCOMTDM29.pdf","Canada, WTO, Canada, Department, of, Agriculture, International, Development, Agency, Secretariat"

The course content was based on WTO work and also provided practical information on what was happening on the ground in other countries. Ex-participants from Uganda, with whom he had had the opportunity to interact in formulating position papers, played an active role in the Ministry of Trade and Industry. He differed with the delegate of Bangladesh regarding the effectiveness of the study tours. Judging from the experience of participants from Uganda, they were of the view that the trips provided an opportunity to gain practical, hands-on experience. He wondered how they might be made more effective rather than being eliminated. For that, one would need to look closely at the experience of the participants and the content provided. He wondered whether the shortening of the Trade Policy Courses from the original 6 months had had a negative impact on the course content.","WTCOMTDM29.pdf","Uganda, WTO, WTO, Uganda, Ministry, of, Trade, and, Industry, Bangladesh, Uganda"

The representative of Senegal congratulated the Secretariat and he expressed his delegation's satisfaction with the interim evaluation for 1998-99, particularly for its comprehensive nature and pertinent recommendations. Firstly, he noted with interest the proposal for creating sub-regional centers of excellence by training the trainers. It was necessary to have the right synergy between the WTO and other international and regional institutions, the private sector and the beneficiary countries. In addition, the stability and predictability of enhanced technical assistance activities was of utmost importance. Furthermore, the difficulty of evaluating technical assistance activities in the Africa region had already been mentioned. The Secretariat needed to encourage Members and sub-regional organizations to identify their own programmes so as to avoid overlap. The main beneficiaries themselves did not always rationalize their own activities. Moreover, all manuals and teaching materials needed to be in three languages. Finally, they wished that their country could benefit from internships.

Many of their participants were afterwards based either in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Trade or in the mission in Geneva. The importance attached to the Trade Policy Courses was demonstrated by the large number of applications: there were 300 applications from 150 countries for the course. It was important to enable developing countries to participate effectively in the world trading system. The Trade Policy Course was one of the core elements of the technical assistance and capacity building programme, helping developing countries better integrate into the multilateral trading system. The importance of avoiding duplication had already been mentioned. Every Member was offered one fellowship every two years. One could take advantage of impartial trade-related courses offered at other institutions and countries. The possibility of offering courses at the regional level could also be explored.","WTCOMTDM29.pdf","Mauritius, Ministry, of, Foreign, Affairs, Geneva, Member"

The representative of Ecuador, as an ex-participant, said that many of the trade negotiators were bureaucrats with high qualifications but their interaction with the private sector was very limited. The study tours allowed for a closer look at the real operators in the economy to see how they organized themselves to face the challenges of the marketplace. It was very useful to see the administration and the management of private firms, be they big ones or SMEs, including in the field of electronic commerce. The study tours could be improved but they were as valid as the theoretical training that participants received.","WTCOMTDM29.pdf","Ecuador"
"2487",2487,"144","144.     A representative of the Secretariat said that he would focus on some of the many points raised by Members. He was glad that some of the ex-participants of the trade policy courses had contributed to the discussion on study tours, which dated back 45 years and which had always been considered as an integral part of the programme. It provided the participants with an opportunity to see in practice what the WTO or formerly the GATT meant for government officials. The aim was to ensure that the programme offered during the study tours was directly relevant to the curriculum that had been followed during the trade policy course. At times, it was impossible to avoid a certain departure from that, for example, when visiting a private enterprise which was not familiar with all facets of the WTO. As for visits at the governmental level, it was a useful addition to the theoretical programme for the participants to see how policies were formulated, coordinated, and then implemented. They had also been considering reallocating the funds possibly to finance additional fellowships. However, the decision was not taken lightly because they were aware of the usefulness of the study tours, not only for the participants, but also for the host countries, which considered them as long-term investment. They were far from being tourism activities even if that was at times part of the programme. The host countries had themselves attached high importance to the tours and had committed a lot of money to it, expecting a return in the long term. The representative of Chile had suggested that there be better coordination with other technical cooperation activities in the house, namely, with some of the other courses taking place, either on dispute settlement or on other selected issues. They were not adjusting the course programme to fit other activities, which were meant to reach out to more people, not just to train the same people. Whatever was being taught in the special courses was also covered in the regular courses. With respect to the comment of the representative of Venezuela on having participants of the same level, he said that the selection was done on the basis of written application. While certain participants might look alike on paper, that might not in fact be the case. Besides, they were not aiming at uniformity in that respect, since their mandate was not to provide a specialized course to train experts, but rather to provide a better understanding of all the WTO Agreements and the multilateral trading system to participants, who would contribute to policy formation once they returned to their capitals. There had been some problems in this respect in certain groups. There was possibly a misunderstanding of the objectives of the courses, which were explained in the invitation letter. The addition of economies in transition to the list of invitees had not been at the detriment of the other countries. The economies in transition did not get priority in receiving fellowships. They had just been integrated into the list of invitees. There was also a mandate from the High Level Meeting on Least-Developed Countries that they should give priority to least-developed countries and they had done so.                 They supported wholeheartedly the WT/COMTD/M/29 Page 30 Director-General's proposal which would reduce the fellowship cycle to one year. It depended on the willingness of the Members to provide the necessary funding. They had taken note of all the proposals and recommendations.","WTCOMTDM29.pdf","Secretariat, Members, WTO, GATT, WTO, Chile, Venezuela, WTO, Director-General, Members"
"2488",2488,"145","145.     The representative of the United States referred to the issue of coordination, which the representative of the Secretariat had addressed in his very thorough response. They too were interested in seeing more coordination in-house. The way the agenda for that day had been structured certainly went quite far in the area of internal coordination. It certainly helped them understand better what was going on with respect to WTO-specific technical assistance. At times it was hard for them track down where a certain amount of their funding had gone. It would be better if there were one central source for channelling all information on funding so that all technical assistance activities could be easily tracked down. Further to recent legislative decisions in the United States, her delegation was looking into additional funding for technical assistance.                 Comprehensive documentation on WTO technical assistance initiatives would help them get a better picture of which areas they should be targetting in addition to their bilateral assistance and WTO technical assistance.

"2489",2489,"146","146.    The representative of the European Communities said that in conjunction with the document WT/COMTD/W/69 on technical assistance, there was another document circulated in the Customs Valuation Committee with the symbol G/VAL/W/71. The European Communities had circulated a document on Trade-Related Technical Assistance in the WTO in April of that year (WT/COMTD/W/69). He wished to explain to the Committee the guiding concepts which had led them to introduce the paper, and also to explore with the Committee how to proceed. The Community strongly welcomed the fact that one of the results of the Seattle Ministerial, which without ambiguity was positive, was the new approach by Members on technical assistance in the WTO. The issue had been the subject of intensive debate in the CTD, but also in the General Council where various contributions by individual delegations and the WTO Secretariat had been put forward. There was broad consensus in the organization that it was necessary to have more and better technical assistance. The time had come to translate the consensus into concrete action. It was not an easy exercise, as the delivery of technical assistance was complex, involved many players, required adequate financial and human resources, and a clear vision of what the Members wanted to achieve. The first result of the EC's thinking was contained in document WT/COMTD/W/69. The key principles governing their thinking, which they did not claim to have invented, but which they wanted to reinforce, were: (i) ownership, a demand-driven approach, including full participation by the recipients to better target the actual needs; and (ii) better cooperation between the donors to enhance coherence and better use of funds and serious follow-up once technical assistance measures had been implemented to draw the appropriate lessons. These principles were well known to Members, as they formed the core of the Integrated Framework which had been agreed in 1997. It was not the place to assess the work of the Integrated Framework, which would be done in the Committee in a different context. Whatever the views were on the Integrated Framework, the principles governing it remained valid and were the appropriate starting-point for further reflection on technical assistance in the WTO. The same conclusion had been drawn in different contexts. The recent statement of the Chair following the Darwin APEC Ministerial contained an Annex B, which included capacity building in APEC related to the implementation of the WTO Agreements. It was worth noting that their emphasis on the principles of the Integrated Framework did not mean that they wanted to expand the Integrated Framework in its present form to other countries. It was premature, and had the inherent danger of lessening the attention they all had to pay to the difficult situation of the LDCs. The EC attached importance to coherence in the international setting. Many delegations had pointed out that technical assistance had to go beyond the mere implementation via domestic laws of the highly technical WTO Agreements. Building domestic capacities and achieving supply-side reform required a large variety of measures, which were trade-related, but which the WTO Secretariat with its limited means could not tackle on its own. The EC had witnessed progress in the effort to mainstream trade into                                                                                      WT/COMTD/M/29                                                                                             Page 31 development strategies but certainly more remained to be done in cooperation with all international development institutions. The EC wished to inform the Committee that they had taken a first step in the Customs Valuation Committee to see how they could turn their good intentions to concrete action. While the document circulated had qualified the approach therein as a pilot project, the EC were of the view that it was more adequate to talk of a renewed approach to customs valuation aiming at strengthening and reinvigorating the approach already taken in that Committee. Looking at the activities undertaken in that Committee, the EC had found that a bottom-up approach to technical assistance in line with their own had already been taken. It meant that the Committee had looked at the individual needs of countries which had problems in meeting certain deadlines and had identified the necessary steps which would enable countries concerned to implement the various provisions of the Customs Valuation Agreement. It had also tried to coordinate the various actors which delivered technical assistance. The EC had taken the initiative to systematise and generalise the principles underlining the approach, in order to strengthen and reinforce the direction of the ongoing work. The initiative would also help gain experience in applying the general principle referred to earlier in a very important area of WTO work. If successful, a similar targeted approach could be adopted for example in the areas of Technical Barriers to Trade (TBT) or Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures (SPS). The Chair of the Customs Valuation Committee had been mandated to consult informally and the EC hoped to have consensus on the concrete steps necessary to strengthen technical assistance in customs valuation very soon. The CTD would be kept informed. The EC hoped that the results of their efforts in the area of customs valuation, and soon after in other Committees, would allow the Committee on Trade and Development to evaluate the results of the EC's renewed approach in line with the CTD's responsibilities on technical assistance and capacity building.","WTCOMTDM29.pdf","European, Communities, Customs, Valuation, Committee, European, Communities, WTO, Committee, Committee, Community, Seattle, Ministerial, Members, WTO, CTD, General, Council, WTO, Secretariat, Members, EC, Members, Integrated, Framework, Committee, WTO, APEC, APEC, WTO, Integrated, Framework, EC, WTO, WTO, Secretariat, EC, EC, Committee, Customs, Valuation, Committee, EC, Committee, Committee, EC, Committee, Customs, Valuation, Agreement, EC, WTO, Customs, Valuation, Committee, EC, CTD, EC, Committee, on, Trade, and, Development, EC, CTD"

Capacity-building could and needed to be addressed in a broader sense to ensure that technical assistance activities in the WTO were properly focused. It was important to give consideration in parallel to improving the functioning of the Integrated Framework so as to contribute to the enhancement of the work in capacity-building. As for funding, they appreciated that some Members, including the EC and their member states, had been making voluntary extra-budgetary contributions to enable technical assistance activities to be undertaken. However, funding from the regular budget was the only way to secure stability and continuity of technical assistance activities. The representative reiterated its strong support and intention to actively contribute to the work towards this goal, hoping that a satisfactory solution would be achieved in the near future.","WTCOMTDM29.pdf","Hong, Kong, China, Members, WTO, Integrated, Framework, Members, EC"

The representative of Jamaica thanked the EC for their interesting paper and said that an integrated approach as proposed should prove to be a more efficient means of delivering technical assistance and ensuring that technical assistance from and the policies of international organizations were harmonized. Full participation by recipient countries and a demand-driven orientation should realize great effectiveness and efficiency in the use of technical assistance funding. There was a general impression that technical assistance was supply-side driven to a significant degree, resulting in a poor match between needs and resources. In the recent seminar on implementation, her delegation had raised the point that the implementation needs of developing countries went well beyond a basic introduction to elements of the WTO Agreements as many difficulties were encountered in the actual hands-on or practical application of the Agreements. Such had been Jamaica's experience. Jamaica had benefitted from assistance in implementing the Customs Valuation Agreement; however, it faced similar resource constraints in implementing other WTO Agreements, such as those relating to trade remedy rules. Jamaica would not expect the implementation of a new approach to result in a reduction of the current total level of assistance to recipient countries. The gap in funding to cover technical activities for the year 2000 and beyond was a perennial concern requiring a long-term, predictable and stable solution. The solution was in providing funding from the regular budget. Jamaica welcomed the fact that the importance of providing technical assistance for WT/COMTD/M/29 Page 32 implementing WTO Agreements and for wider capacity building had come increasingly to the forefront of discussions in the organization.","WTCOMTDM29.pdf","Jamaica, EC, WTO, Jamaica, Jamaica, Customs, Valuation, Agreement, WTO, Jamaica, Jamaica, WTO"
"2492",2492,"149","149.     The representative of Bangladesh said that the EC delegate's introduction had outlined the basic ideas that the EC wished to follow in its technical assistance activities in the WTO. Bangladesh welcomed the recognition by the EU that more needed to be done in the area. There was consensus that adequate resources would need to be found. There was a group of countries that needed to be brought into the mainstream of technical assistance activities. They wished to see the principles of ownership, participation, coherence, a demand-driven approach, etc., played up in the new system. If those principles were followed diligently, it would increase the value-added in technical assistance activities. He welcomed the proposal that the Integrated Framework be brought into parallel play in the new system. The IF provided a parallel but very important set of activities which donor countries, particularly important donors like the EC, would have to follow with more diligence. Bangladesh also welcomed the fact that the EC was not in favor of expanding the IF at that stage. His delegation was concerned sometime back that there were discussions about expanding the stillborn or not fully developed IF into other areas. There was no question of expanding it to other countries than the LDCs until they had seen how it shaped up. Bangladesh also appreciated the point made by the EC that they wished to see a trade and supply response as well as other trade-related activities mainstreamed into the WTO work, reflecting the development strategies of the poorest. With respect to the Customs Valuation Agreement, he was sure that the EC would keep in mind the different needs of countries in the new programme. For example, his country had already entered the new phase of the Customs Valuation Agreement commitments. Therefore, his country's needs were different from those of a country which was awaiting transition. If there was an overarching concern about being fair and equal to all countries, that in itself would be unfair.","WTCOMTDM29.pdf","Bangladesh, EC, EC, WTO, Bangladesh, EU, Integrated, Framework, EC, Bangladesh, EC, Bangladesh, EC, WTO, Customs, Valuation, Agreement, EC, Customs, Valuation, Agreement"

The representative of Canada supported the overall thrust of the EC paper, which advocated among other things a demand-driven and more coherent technical assistance approach. Canada also expressed support for the Japanese paper on trade-related capacity building. There were cross-links between the APEC work and the EU proposal. Technical assistance was a priority and it was important to continue to reflect on it. The various reports provided by the Secretariat were useful in that respect.

They acknowledged the commitment of the EC in providing resources for the initial pilot project. Technical assistance in the area of building capacity needed to focus on improving expertise in trade policy formulation and not only on implementation. Implementation was important but there were also other aspects of trade policy which needed to be given due consideration. Countries needed to understand the principles and rationale behind the approach to the multilateral system: trade policy courses provided such an opportunity. Funding was a major concern and they welcomed the initiatives of donor countries in contributing to technical assistance activities.","WTCOMTDM29.pdf","Malaysia, EC, EC"
"2496",2496,"152","152.     The representative of Mexico said that the intention of the EC paper was to reach better coherence in the application of technical assistance in the organization. The new focus of the EU was based on two pillars: technical assistance and capacity building. There was a clear distinction being made between the two. The aim of the former was to promote the understanding and use of the WTO rules so that recipients were able to exploit to a maximum the opportunities offered by the multilateral trading system. That approach was already being applied in various Committees and the Technical Cooperation Division. The second, capacity-building, went beyond technical assistance and was implicit in the Integrated Framework, which emphasized administrative, technical and financial capacity building. It would be important to follow and learn from developments in the IF. In the area of Customs Valuation, there was already a technical assistance programme, coordinated with the Technical Cooperation Division. There was a coherent approach since both the Committee and the                                                                                    WT/COMTD/M/29                                                                                           Page 33 Division carried out the administration of the programme and examined technical assistance support that was being provided by other IGOs, regional organizations and bilateral assistance. Presenting the outcome of the pilot project in the CTD would be very useful. The lack of funding was a fundamental concern in the exercise. With respect to the Integrated Framework, according to information received recently, a fund had been set up at UNCTAD to be able to focus attention on the projects that had been presented in the framework of the IF. However, at present, it seemed that no project had been implemented due to lack of funding.         In the WTO, there was a Global Fund, through which developed countries could make contributions in order to support technical assistance. This was a good channel, a part from the possibility of having more funds available from the regular budget.","WTCOMTDM29.pdf","Mexico, EC, EU, WTO, Customs, Valuation, Technical, Cooperation, Division, Committee, CTD, UNCTAD, WTO"
"2497",2497,"153","153.     The representative of Norway joined previous speakers in thanking the EC for their constructive paper, which contained a lot of good ideas. Norway shared the objective of better coordination and structuring of trade related technical assistance, including the formulation of objectives and monitoring and evaluation of projects. Members could learn from UN organizations with vast experience in projects, including those which were not necessarily technical projects on WTO matters. Nevertheless, the U.N. had something to teach on how to monitor and evaluate projects. Her delegation fully agreed with the EC that there was need for more coherence in carrying out of technical assistance activities in the trade area in order to make it more efficient and to avoid overlap. Norway was not convinced that coordination needed to be done within the WTO. The WTO should not develop into becoming more of a technical assistance organization, but rather its technical assistance should aimed at helping Members to meet their obligations and benefit from their rights in accordance with the Agreements. The challenge would be to find a modality on how to achieve coherence and coordination between technical assistance activities of WTO, other IGOs and donor countries. Norway found the proposed pilot project on customs valuation to be a good initiative. It was not meant to be exhaustive and other trade-related areas could be of interest as well. She recalled an intervention by the Moroccan Ambassador at a meeting on implementation some time ago where he had underlined the need for LDCs in Africa to define their needs in the implementation area. It all boiled down to financing, as had been mentioned by several speakers. She fully subscribed to what had been eloquently stated by the delegate of Hong Kong, China, both with respect to voluntary contributions and to the financing of technical assistance through the regular budget.","WTCOMTDM29.pdf","Norway, EC, Norway, Members, UN, WTO, U.N., EC, Norway, WTO, WTO, Members, WTO, Norway, Ambassador, LDCs, Africa, Hong, Kong, China"

He would explain his delegation's proposal based on the summary of the proposal in document WT/COMTD/W/75. The full version submitted to APEC had been circulated as a room document that day. The background of the proposal was clear and self-explanatory. Developing Members of the WTO were facing difficulties in implementing WTO Agreements. The question of implementation had been taken up as an important issue in the preparatory process and was one of the reasons why the Members could not reach consensus at the Third Ministerial Conference in Seattle. In order to strengthen the multilateral trading system and also to integrate developing members within the system, capacity-building related to implementation of WTO Agreements was a matter of priority. In the WTO, the importance of confidence-building measures had been confirmed in early May. In APEC, Japan's proposal of capacity-building as APEC's contribution to the WTO had been welcomed by senior officials earlier that year. The draft proposal had then been circulated to all APEC WT/COMTD/M/29 Page 34 members. The revised proposal had been endorsed at the APEC Trade ministers meeting in Darwin, Australia on 6-7 June. The purpose of the proposal was to facilitate the implementation of WTO Agreements and the integration of developing economies into the multilateral trading system and to alleviate the concerns and the burden of the developing economies of APEC to participate in a new round. The WTO and other organizations were reviewing the IF, which was designed to support capacity-building of least developed countries. The Director-General and the Secretariat were engaged in discussions on capacity-building with other relevant international organizations, such as the World Bank. On 6 July there would be a high-level coordination meeting on the improvement of the IF. His delegation fully understood that least-developed countries had major needs for capacity-building and supported the IF. However, more attention needed to be paid to developing countries in general, including developing economies in APEC. That was the reason why Japan had introduced the proposal in APEC on strategy and on measures to help developing economies in APEC to support capacity building needs. The gist of the proposal was that based on the needs of the individual economies APEC should have its own initiative for strengthening capacity-building activities in developing economies, with the cooperation of developed economies in the area, the WTO and other relevant international organizations. The Japanese proposal consisted of four elements: (a) identification of needs and drafting of proposals and the APEC strategy; (b) endorsement of the APEC strategy to be utilised as appropriate in the context of the development strategy of members and related international organizations; (c) identification of possible sources of funding for the programme; (d) creation of a mechanism for achieving and following up the programme. Regarding the objectives to enhance capacity in developing countries, they envisaged the following six elements: (i) expanding knowledge and skills for implementation of WTO Agreements; (ii) developing a legal framework for domestic implementation; (iii) enhancing the physical infrastructure for domestic implementation; (iv) enhancing the negotiation skills of those participating in international negotiations; (v) building capacity to participate in the international dispute settlement mechanisms of the WTO; (vi) contributing to support for accession to WTO by new Members. Questionnaires would be used for the effective identification of needs of developing economies in these six categories, on the basis of which studies would be conducted. Through such studies, the needs of developing countries in APEC would be identified in detail and concrete projects would be designed. Two case studies had already carried out to assess the needs for capacity-building, and there was a very ambitious schedule to carry out the project. First, on 6-7 June, Trade Ministers had already agreed to develop further the APEC strategy. Second, after the Trade Ministers meeting, Japan was to distribute the questionnaires to all APEC developing countries. Third, by the end of August, interested economies would respond to the questionnaires. Fourth, from September to October, a coordinating group of APEC members would coordinate further activities in view of the studies held in interested economies. Next, on 12-13 November, on the occasion of the APEC Ministerial Meeting in Brunei and on the basis of the activities already explained, Ministers would be asked to endorse the APEC strategy to be utilised as appropriate in the context of the development strategies of members. The investment liberalization fund would be allocated to possible pilot projects. At the same time, it was hoped that Ministers would agree that Members would adjust their priorities as appropriate in their development programmes in the light of the APEC strategy. Ministers would also be asked to invite relevant international development organizations such as World Bank and the Asian Development Bank to provide support for the programme. APEC Trade Ministers supported the Japanese proposal to help developing members of APEC in capacity-building related to the implementation of WTO Agreements. Japan would continue to cooperate with all APEC economies, the WTO Secretariat and other relevant international organizations to achieve a meaningful result from the initiative. He hoped that his explanation would help Members understand the APEC initiative and that the initiative would complement efforts in the WTO to enhance capacity-building for implementation of WTO Agreements. As a supplementary point, another representative of Japan, said that it was an APEC initiative and did not directly relate to WTO. The paper had been introduced for two reasons: for transparency purposes and to see if any lessons could be drawn from the APEC activities. They found that the spirit of the APEC initiative had commonalties with the EC initiative.

He said that OPEC had made its request in view of its interest in the activities of the Committee. He said that OPEC Members were heavily dependent on income from oil, and as such, was heavily concerned by development issues addressed by the CTD. He said that OPEC played an important role in global trade, and the consequences of such trade for development could not be overestimated. He said that some OPEC member countries were in the WTO, while other were in the process of accession. He said that OPEC had also applied to the Committee on Trade and Environment (CTE), and that by applying to both the CTD and the CTE, it wished to correct the impression that it was only concerned with price and quota fixing, which were the most visible parts of its activities. He said that OPEC was                                                                                   WT/COMTD/M/29                                                                                           Page 3 also seriously concerned with the environmental impact of oil resources, as well as the equilibrium between oil producers and oil exporters. OPEC therefore sought ad hoc Observer Status with the CTD and the CTE, in order to benefit from the work of the Committees in these areas. He said that the Nigerian delegation strongly supported the application by OPEC for ad hoc Observer Status, and called on members to give the application favourable consideration.","WTCOMTDM29.pdf","Nigeria, OPEC, OPEC, Committee, OPEC, Members, CTD, OPEC, OPEC, WTO, OPEC, Committee, on, Trade, and, Environment, CTD, CTE, OPEC, OPEC, CTD, CTE, OPEC"

The Chairman refered to the statement made by the Director-General at the 3 May General Council meeting regarding provision of information on market access for exports originating in least-developed countries, and said he wished to take up an issue of procedure. He said that normally notifications and information provided on changes to the GSP were sent to the CTD under the provisions of the Enabling Clause. He assumed, therefore, that information on any actions taken by developed Members under their GSP schemes in favour of LDCs would also be provided in this way. On the other hand, steps taken by developing countries under the 1999 Waiver on Preferential Tariff Treatment for LDCs were to be notified to the Council on Trade in Goods. There was clearly an inconsistency here. What he propose was that, with Members' permission, he would consult with the Chairman of the CTG (and with the Chair of the Sub-Committee on LDCs) on how to resolve this inconsistency. He proposed that informal consultations could be held once he had spoken to the Chairman of the CTG.","WTCOMTDM29.pdf","Chairman, Director-General, GSP, CTD, Members, LDCs, Members, Chairman, CTG, Chairman, CTG"

"2510",2510,"165","165.     The Director, Development Division said that the Secretariat had initiated a number of activities in respect of non-resident members, of which there were 28, and non-resident observers of which there were nine. Of these 37 countries, 17 were least-developed. The first of these initiatives was the hosting by the WTO of the ""Geneva Week"" in favour of non-residents. A first Geneva Week was held in November 1999, and the second Geneva Week was scheduled for a full week, running from 21 to 27 October 2000. It would immediately follow the meeting of the UNCTAD's Trade and Development Board, beginning with the holding of a seminar on small economies under the auspices of the CTD, on 21 October, and finishing with the 31st Session of the CTD scheduled for 27 October. He said that the proposed programme for Geneva Week 2000 gave emphasis to mandated negotiations; to implementation issues; to developments in the field of technical cooperation (including the new structure of the Integrated Framework); to developments in relation to market access and electronic commerce; and to development in the ""Trade and…"" topics, such as trade and environment, trade and investment and so forth. It was hoped that other organisations could be invited. It was intended to finance the participation of one representative from capitals, and one from the European-based Mission (where this existed). The total cost of the week was estimated at approximately SwF570,000. The Secretariat would be looking for assistance from Members to meet the costs of Geneva Week 2000. The second of these initiatives was the preparation of briefing notes, which gave an overview of selected areas of WTO work. The notes were sent out by e-mail and fax to non- residents. The notes drew on material already available to Members, and were intended to provide non-residents with a concise overview of on-going activities. The third set of initiatives lay in discussions held by the Director-General with non-resident Members and certain smaller resident Members in order to examine ways of enhancing the participation of such members in the work of the WTO. In this context, some Members had proposed that there be established a centre to support the work of non-residents. In considering such a proposal, it was necessary to avoid duplication with other facilities existing in Geneva, to ensure that there was ownership of the work carried out by the centre, and to ensure that the work was truly responsive to the needs of non-residents. Finally, the attention of Members was drawn to a questionnaire circulated on 24 May 2000 requesting feedback from Member on various aspects of WTO work. To date, 40 replies had been received, out of which 33 were developing or transition economies. Feedback was sought on the utility of different tools used by the Secretariat to facilitate the dissemination of information. Responses received showed that the WTO web-site was found by delegations to be most useful, followed by press-releases, the Document Dissemination Facility and the Integrated Data-Base. Members had suggested that improvements could be made to the Daily Bulletin, in terms of augmenting and standardising the information contained therein.","WTCOMTDM29.pdf","Director, Development, Division, Secretariat, WTO, Geneva, Week, UNCTAD, Trade, and, Development, Board, CTD, CTD, Integrated, Framework, Secretariat, Members, WTO, Members, Director-General, Members, Members, WTO, Members, Geneva, Members, Member, WTO, Secretariat, WTO, Integrated, Data-Base, Members"

Her delegation also looked forward to the concretisation of initiatives which were aimed at facilitating the participation of non-residents, which had not yet borne fruit. Her delegation admitted to being one of those which had not yet submitted a response to the questionnaire, and this was partly due to the capacity constraints inherent to smaller missions – a somewhat ironic situation given that the questionnaire was aimed to a large extent to identify just such constraints.

"2525",2525,"179","179.     The representative of Zambia thanked the staff of the Development Division for their full cooperation, and especially Ms Métivier and Mrs Vittori of the division's secretariat. His delegation wished to thank all delegations of both developing and developed countries that had supported or showed a positive attitude to the proposal made presented by Zambia at the 28th Session of the CTD. He said that such an attitude was a real motivation for smaller missions such as his to participate in the meetings of the WTO. He said that the ultimate objective of the implementation exercise and of work in the WTO was to strengthen the supply capacity of developing countries, especially LDCs, by creating a sound technology base. Because technology development was the basis for development, transfer arrangements tended to be economically and technologically complex. It was important to develop capabilities within these countries to facilitate the acquisition of technology. It was in this context that Zambia had presented a proposal at the 28th Session of the CTD, which received support from members, and which Zambia hoped would soon be an integral part of the CTD work programme. He said that the Zambia proposal assumed that efforts by the WTO in the implementation of provisions on technology transfer needed to be complemented by other organisations. The essence of the proposal contained in document WT/COMTD/W67 was to kick-start the process of implementation of the provisions relating to technology transfer to developing countries, particularly LDCs, which all Members realised was at the heart of improving the integration of such economies in the global trading system. The proposal was not about technical assistance, but about the exploration of a mechanism to implement these provisions. While technical assistance remained important in improving supply capacity, it was not a substitute for technology- content products that were essential for developing countries to compete. He said that in order to compete effectively, products from developing countries needed a technology content, and its blending with current forms of capacity-building. On its own, the current form of capacity building would not do much to salvage the trade position of LDCs. Technology content was the dynamo and only hope for integrating LDCs in the world trading system. He said that Zambia were aware of Uruguay Round Agreements that were supply-oriented. In addition to TRIPS, other opportunities, that were refered to in the seminar on implementation issues, did exist for the WTO to spur the supply response of LDCs. These included Agreements such as the GATS, SPS, TBT, TRIMs, Subsidies, Services, and issues such as coherence. He said that at a later stage it would perhaps be possible to specify to the CTD the potential opportunities of other agreements. What was needed was simply the political will among developed country trading partners. This was why Zambia wished to put technology transfer at the centre of WTO activities. Technology transfer required a series of steps, and the Zambian proposal was about starting that process. He said that in this context, his delegation strongly supported the suggestion made by Norway in the 28th Session of the CTD that the international organisations listed in the proposal, namely the UNCTAD, the WIPO, the UNIDO, and the World Bank, and indeed any other organisation competent in the area of technology be invited to provide information on their work in the area of technology. As was said in the seminar on implementation, approaches existed through which technology transfer could be achieved. The contributions of organisations such as those mentioned above, and individual experts such as Mr. Jeffrey Sachs, would go a long way in assisting the WTO to implement such important provisions.","WTCOMTDM29.pdf","Zambia, Mrs, Vittori, Zambia, CTD, WTO, WTO, Zambia, CTD, Zambia, CTD, Zambia, WTO, Members, Zambia, Uruguay, WTO, GATS, SPS, TBT, CTD, Zambia, WTO, Norway, UNCTAD, WIPO, UNIDO, World, Bank, Jeffrey, Sachs, WTO"

These economies were listed in the document. Japan's intention to exclude these economies was first notified in WT/COMTD/N/2/Add.7 of 10 June 1998. He quoted from the final paragraph of Annex 1 to that document, which read: ""starting from 1 April 2000, a beneficiary country or territory is to be excluded from the list of GSP beneficiaries if it is classified as a high income economy in the previous three years' World Bank Atlas in a row or, when it is not on the World Bank Atlas, recognized to have the same level of GNP per capita."" In setting such a criterion, Japan had considered the purpose and objectives of the GSP, and the level of development of the territory in question. Also considered was the strength of domestic industry in Japan, the need to expand benefits to beneficiaries other than advanced economies, and modifications made by other countries providing preferences through the GSP.","WTCOMTDM29.pdf","Japan, Japan, Japan, GSP, World, Bank, Atlas, World, Bank, Atlas, Japan, GSP, Japan, GSP"

"2535",2535,"188","188.    A seminar on the Implementation of WTO Agreements was held on 26 June 2000 under the auspices of the WTO Committee on Trade and Development. The seminar was opened by the Director-General, who said that implementation issues were among the main reasons for the failure to reach agreement in Seattle and remained a key to the launching of any new negotiations. A special mechanism established under the General Council had just begun its work, and the seminar should provide insights which would help that process. Developing countries had an interest in implementing fully WTO Agreements, but there were real problems that required time and technical assistance, while WTO resources were limited. While some options for industrial development may be foreclosed through implementation, there were other WTO consistent measures for this purpose, and the Director-General indicated his interest in hearing Members' views on the options. He believed the seminar would be a useful start in the process of resolving the difficult questions relating to implementation.","WTCOMTDM29.pdf","WTO, WTO, Committee, on, Trade, and, Development, Director-General, Seattle, General, Council, WTO, WTO, WTO, Director-General, Members"
"2536",2536,"189","189.     The seminar took the form of a series of panels covering (a) an overview of implementation issues; (b) policy perspectives on implementation; (c) practical aspects of implementation (focussing mainly on TRIPs, Customs Valuation and TRIMs); (d) difficulties of developing countries in the pursuit of their rights under the WTO; and (e) a round-up session looking at the way forward on the issues. Panelists included Geneva-based ambassadors and other delegates, as well as representatives of international organisations and the academic community.","WTCOMTDM29.pdf","Customs, Valuation, WTO"

The representative of Canada said that his delegation had no strong views in respect of any of the organisations whose application was under consideration, though Canada did have a preference that any decision on Observer Status be postponed until the General Council had issued guidelines. He sought clarification as to whether the proposal was to grant ad hoc or permanent Observer Status.","WTCOMTDM29.pdf","Canada, Canada, General, Council"
"2538",2538,"190","190.    Presentations showed that the general theme of implementation covered a number of distinct, but inter-related, issues, including the process of bringing national policy regimes into conformity with multilateral rules and disciplines; a perception by some Members that benefits expected from the Uruguay Round Agreements had failed to materialise; and a perception by some Members that there existed imbalances and asymmetries in Agreements. One participant emphasised that there was a number of areas where implementation was proceeding as scheduled, and that a focus in the seminar on problems only could give a misleading impression.","WTCOMTDM29.pdf","Members, Uruguay, Members"
"2539",2539,"191","191.    Concerning the process of bringing national policy regimes into conformity with multilateral rules and disciplines, presentations made by panelists and from the floor drew attention to the magnitude of human and financial resources and technical and institutional capacity required to implement a number of the WTO Agreements and to ensure their proper enforcement. This was perhaps most vividly illustrated by the case of the TRIPS Agreement and the Agreement on Customs Valuation. The point was also made that failure to achieve conformity was not always primarily a result of resource or capacity constraints. For example, in the TRIMs Agreement, lack of implementation could also stem from policy considerations, particularly in relation to the anticipated costs of adjustment associated with the phasing out of WTO inconsistent measures, notably in the automotive industry, where most remaining TRIMs were being used.","WTCOMTDM29.pdf","WTO, Customs, Valuation, WTO"
"2540",2540,"192","192.    A separate set of implementation concerns related to the perception by some Members that anticipated benefits had failed to materialise owing to insufficient action on the part of others. Members cited textiles and clothing, continuing market access barriers and domestic support measures in agriculture, insufficient ""Mode Four"" liberalisation in services, the cost of anti-dumping actions for developing country exports, and a lack of operationalization of provisions relating to transfer of         1             This was first issued as Job No. 4175 on 30/06/2000.

In response, it was stated that in some areas, developed countries had not realized benefits owing to the persistence of access barriers in the markets of developing Members for trade in both goods and services in which developed Members enjoyed a comparative advantage.","WTCOMTDM29.pdf","Members, Members, Members, Members"
"2541",2541,"193","193.     Some speakers pointed to perceived asymmetries in WTO Agreements, and a lack of balance in rights and obligations applying to developing country Members. The view was expressed that, while there may have been imbalances, actions to achieve redressal and rebalancing of Agreements might best be taken as part of further trade negotiations.","WTCOMTDM29.pdf","WTO, Members"
"2542",2542,"194","194.     The question arose whether the implementation of certain WTO agreements in some countries made economic sense from a policy perspective. It was suggested that a negative answer could perhaps be given, particularly for certain least-developed countries, where the implementation of certain agreements was particularly onerous from a budgetary point of view. However, the point was made that the implementation of Agreements which imposed heavy demands on resources could nevertheless yield significant benefits by improving the transparency and predictability of policy regimes and thus signalling the credibility of policy reform to foreign investors. A positive outcome would also result where implementation required the phasing out of trade-distorting measures.","WTCOMTDM29.pdf","WTO"
"2543",2543,"195","195.    Technical assistance and capacity-building were cited as important factors in assisting implementation. In the areas of Intellectual Property Rights and Customs Valuation, specialized agencies such as the WIPO and the WCO devoted considerable resources to supporting Members in the implementation process. Speakers pointed to problems in WTO technical assistance resulting from difficulties in funding and a focus on the holding of seminars and workshops, which had limited impact in facilitating implementation. Issues of concern to least-developed countries were raised, notably the severe capacity constraints faced by such countries, which hampered their ability to participate effectively in international trade and to implement their WTO commitments. Emphasis was given to the need to facilitate access to technology, and to ensure that the Integrated Framework delivered tangible results.","WTCOMTDM29.pdf","Intellectual, Property, Rights, and, Customs, Valuation, WIPO, WCO, Members, WTO, WTO, Integrated, Framework"
"2544",2544,"196","196.    Speakers pointed to the need for coherence in addressing issues related to implementation. One idea that was stressed was the need to develop an overall strategy that could match implementation objectives with costs, time-periods, and inputs of technical and financial assistance. Some speakers pointed to the need to resolve an inherent tension between the horizontal rule-making approach pursued by the WTO and a case-by-case approach that took into account the specific constraints of individual countries.","WTCOMTDM29.pdf","WTO"
"2545",2545,"197","197.    A number of speakers pointed out that not all implementation issues could be addressed by technical assistance, capacity building measures or financial support. In some cases, implementation involved short-term adjustment costs, while benefits would accrue in the longer term. Implementation was especially problematic where costs appeared to be a certainty, and benefits only a possibility. It was suggested that greater impetus could be given to implementation if actions in developing countries were matched by actions in developed countries in areas where developing countries held comparative advantage.","WTCOMTDM29.pdf",""
"2546",2546,"198","198.    With regard to difficulties experienced by developing countries in the pursuit of their rights within the WTO, it was noted that special and differential treatment provisions were ambiguous, couched in ""best endeavour"" terms, and not enforceable. In addition, matters of ""interpretation"" of WTO provisions had become increasingly significant and had raised questions regarding the balance between policy discretion of individual Members, the collective decision-making responsibilities of the Membership, and the scope and reach of the Dispute Settlement Mechanism.

"2547",2547,"199","199.    The final session reviewed much of the discussion during the day. In relation to the processes currently under way in the WTO, it was emphasised that the objectives of the special mechanism under the General Council were to assess the difficulties, to identify ways to resolve them whether by technical assistance or substantive changes, and to take decisions on the appropriate action. While paragraphs 21 and 22 of the draft Ministerial Text of 19 October 19992 were the main basis for discussion, it was important to take into account developments that had taken place in recent months. A good start had been made in the Special Mechanism but it was necessary to move beyond the restatement of positions. Both the seminar and the General Council discussions had demonstrated that while different views persisted in some areas, there was full recognition of the importance of implementation issues and the need to resolve them.         2             Job(99)/5868/Rev.1                                                                                     WT/COMTD/M/29                                                                                            Page 43                                               ANNEX II                                            Statement by                Mr. O.

Obviously, industry and trade have a strong correlation, as without productive and technological capacity, countries have limited ability to diversify their exports and engage in high- value added, international trade.

"2553",2553,"203","203.    By the nature of UNIDO’s work and mandate, UNIDO’s contribution to trade promotion is through promoting the industrial competitiveness of developing countries, improving their productive capacities and addressing overall supply-side conditions.

"2554",2554,"204","204.     As some of you may know, UNIDO has engaged in a major reform process that was launched in early 1998. Since then, UNIDO has drastically reoriented its operations, both on the administrative and organizational level, but most importantly on the programmatic level. Basically, UNIDO has been refocusing its services into 16 core services in pursuit of sustainable industrial development, which the organization defines as competitive economy, productive employment, and a sound environment (the so-called 3 E’s). These basic dimensions capture the essence of UNIDO’s services, intended to enhance the competitiveness of enterprises and of the countries in which they operate, to address and prevent ecological problems in industrialization, and to stimulate the creation of productive jobs.         UNIDO Services in the Field of Trade Promotion","WTCOMTDM29.pdf","UNIDO, UNIDO, UNIDO, UNIDO, UNIDO, Services"
"2555",2555,"205","205.    Without going into the detail of all 16 services, let me briefly pinpoint those are relevant from a trade and supply-side perspective. I also wish to underline, that UNIDO is by and large a technical assistance agency, focussing on practical, project-driven type of programmes and with less emphasis to analysis, research and reporting.         •       formulation of industrial or supply-side policies. The main objective of this service is                 to encourage good industrial governance by providing policy advice and build                 institutional capacity for policy analysis and formulation. In the process of policy                 formulation and implementation, UNIDO suggests to set up public-private sector                 consultation mechanisms so as to fully involve the private sector and tap into its                 developmental potential. Often a environmental policy element is being introduced,                 such as in China, where UNIDO is conceiving strategies for the competitiveness of                 key sectors, in particular the automotive sector.         •       sub-sectoral support, Under this service modules, UNIDO seeks to strengthen the link                 between agriculture with industry and to upgrade entire productive systems in the WT/COMTD/M/29 Page 44           agro-industry sector. In line with UNIDO’s comparative expertise, priority sector           include food processing, textile and leather, wood, agro-machinery and chemicals. To           enable the production of competitive goods of consistent quality demanded by the           specific markets, UNIDO pursues a holistic approach, involving the full range of           sector-specific and cross-sectoral institutions and policy issues. Projects also           integrate factory-level support, such as technology assessments and on-the job           training on technology transfer issues, product quality, process optimization,           maintenance, cost minimization and product safety.      •    continuous improvement and quality management at the productive level. The aim of           this service module, is to restructure and upgrade industries to enhance their           competitiveness, through the introduction of quality management principles. At the           institutional level, UNIDO works with local institutions which are being trained in           enterprise diagnosis, technical audits, performance improvement and good           manufacturing practices. Through these institutions, UNIDO works directly with           enterprises which are being coached in the implementation of the financial and           operational restructuring plans.      •    support to standardization, certification and metrology bodies. The aim of this service           module is to strengthen country’s standardization infrastructure together with national           capacities at government, institutional and enterprise level. This involves the           technical and managerial upgrading of national or regional standardization bodies. It           also involves the establishment or improvement of certification and accreditation           procedures. National and regional certification and accreditation bodies are being           supported to achieve international recognition of certification for products, systems,           laboratories, tests and technical personnel. Institutions in turn improve the capacity at           the enterprise level for improved product and process quality, export performance,           environmental performance and certification to relevant international standards.           A good example of this service module has found application in Uganda, whose           exports to the EU were banned due to the contamination of fish from the Great Lakes.           In parallel with the formulation of safety regulations and inspection standards,           UNIDO has been setting up a laboratory and certification procedure to ensure           compliance with EU regulations, as a result of which Uganda managed to obtain re-           access of its fish products to the European market.      •    cleaner production programmes, pollution control and waste management. The           objective is to create a sustainable balance between industrial development and           environmental management and conservation.           By advising on appropriate clean and waste management technologies and related           production processes, UNIDO seeks to reduce environmental degradation and           pollution caused by industrial production. A centrepiece in this are the national           cleaner production centres (CPCs), which provide advisory services to the local           industry. UNIDO has established CPCs in some 17 countries ( including Guatemala,           Morocco, the Russian Federation, Hungary, India, Nicaragua, Mexico, Slovakia,           Tunisia, Tanzania, Vietnam and Tanzania), while an additional three are planned in           Ethiopia, Kenya and Mozambique.           A sector-specific centre, focusing on the oil and gas industry, was established in the           Russian Federation. In the pesticide sector, a regional cleaner production and           information programme covers some 15 countries in Asia and the Pacific. This                                                                                      WT/COMTD/M/29                                                                                             Page 45                resulted in the banning of the most persistent and toxic pesticides and facilitated the                introduction of new environmentally friendly and bio-pesticides.        •       private sector and enterprise development. UNIDO places private sector development                at the core of its vision and technical assistance and fully subscribes to the global shift                away from government intervention towards the creation of an environment in which                market forces play a dominant role.                UNIDO projects are based on an integrated support strategy, that may include the                promotion of a more favourable policy and institutional environment for SMEs, the                strengthening of business service centres and business incubators with a view to                create, expand and modernize private enterprises. They may also involve the                formation of SME clusters of enterprises to allow for collective business strategies.                Such an integrated private sector development programme is under implementation in                Guinea, where he types of enterprises targeted vary form micro and small enterprises                (such as artisans in the traditional textile sector) to formal, medium-sized enterprises (                ready to engage in partnerships with foreign investors).                In addition, UNIDO is increasingly establishing linkages with institutions and                enterprises in the private sector of developed countries, many of which have become                partners in projects or providers of technical cooperation. In India, for example,                UNIDO has forged a partnership with FIAT, INSEAD, the Prince of Wales Business                Leaders Forum, and the automotive component manufacturers association of India.                The aim is to strengthen the supply chain of Indian SMEs in the automotive                component sector, with a view to linking them up with the supplier network of FIAT.                Through provision of shop-floor level expert advice in areas such as management,                quality, productivity, Indian SME’s are being upgraded to meet international quality                levels and become accredited suppliers to FIAT.        •       investment and technology promotion. Investment and technological innovation are                the prime movers of economic development and globalization. To achieve sustainable                increases in investment and technology flows, UNIDO strengthens local investment                promotion agencies in the promotion and negotiation of foreign investment and                technology projects, with a view to forming international industrial partnerships,                particularly among SMEs. To this end, UNIDO offers a package of tools and                methodologies for the formulation and appraisal of investment projects, their                promotion towards foreign investors, the finalization of cooperation agreements as                well as linkages with the financing system. Under a recent initiative, the UNIDO                Exchange, UNIDO is setting up an electronic platform, accessible through our home                page, which includes databases on investment opportunities, technologies and many                referral points, while allowing partners to engage in business interactions.

A central element of UNIDO’s reform, was not only the focusing and streamlining of its technical assistance services, but also a rethinking in the way these services are being delivered. While in the past, UNIDO would address support requirements through small projects isolated from each other, the new strategy is to package services into integrated country programmes, with well- defined linkages among the various components allowing for a more holistic approach and multi- disciplinary solutions.

He said that from a policy perspective, it was necessary to introduce more equity to enable fair competition from developing countries in world markets. He said that close analysis revealed that the economic and social structures of developing countries were very different from those of developed countries. It was thus necessary to develop a better type of special and differential treatment to avoid distortions which arose from the existence of different negotiating powers between developed countries and developing countries. He said that further seminars on this subject should be held in the future.","WTCOMTDM29.pdf","Cuba"

"2598",2598,"53","53.      The Chairman recalled that at its 28th Session, the CTD had discussed the Seminar on Special and Differential Treatment held on 7 March and the Secretariat paper WT/COMTD/W/66 entitled ""Concerns regarding Special and Differential Treatment Provisions in WTO Agreements and decisions"". Following those discussions, it had been agreed that the item relating to special and differential treatment be kept on the agenda of the CTD, and that the further thought be given on how to take forward the work on this subject. The Chairman said he wished to devote the present Session of the CTD, at least in part, to discussing how this should be done, and noted that a number of suggestions had already been made by Members. Some called for a special working mechanism on special and differential treatment, while a number called for more detailed work to be carried out. It was important that the CTD recognise that since the 28th Session there had been a number of developments. Most notably, a special process on implementation had been established under the auspices of the General Council. Since concerns relating to special and differential treatment were an important part of the implementation question, it was important that the work of the CTD be sensitive to direction by the General Council, and that it did not prejudge the conclusions that might be reached through the General Council process. It was also necessary to recognise that the question of special                                                                                     WT/COMTD/M/29                                                                                             Page 7 and differential treatment was also being pursued at a very detailed technical level in relation to some specific agreements in the different subsidiary bodies of the WTO. The most recent example was the meeting of the Committee on Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures held on 21 and 22 June 2000. The Committee on Technical Barriers to Trade (TBT) was due to organise a workshop on 19 and 20 July 2000 on technical assistance and special and differential treatment in the context of the TBT Agreement, and that in this context a questionnaire has been sent out inviting Members to identify any difficulties encountered in the implementation and operation of the Agreement, as well as any technical assistance needed. It was therefore important to ensure that the work done in the CTD was fully aware of, but did not duplicate, that carried out by other bodies.","WTCOMTDM29.pdf","Chairman, CTD, Secretariat, WTO, CTD, Chairman, CTD, Members, CTD, General, Council, CTD, General, Council, General, Council, WTO, Committee, on, Sanitary, and, Phytosanitary, Measures, Committee, on, Technical, Barriers, to, Trade, Members, CTD"
"2599",2599,"54","54.      The Chairman said that, with these points in mind, it was nevertheless necessary to consider how to take forward the work of the CTD on the subject, as the oversight of the special provisions in favour of developing countries was central to the terms of reference of this Committee. He threw out some pointers to allow the CTD to structure its thinking. It was important to recall that the distinctive feature of the CTD was the horizontal nature of its work – this was well reflected in document WT/COMTD/W/66. The Chairman suggested the CTD could continue with and update the type of stock-taking contained in that document, and collate information on ongoing work on special and differential treatment in the WTO. Secondly, the Chairman said that the CTD could make use of the kind of typology of special and differential provisions was set out in document WT/COMTD/W/66 - which classified special and differential provisions into: (i) provisions aimed at increasing trade opportunities; (ii) provisions that required WTO members to safeguard the interest of developing country Members; (iii) flexibility of commitments; (iv) transitional time periods; (v) technical assistance, and (vi) provisions relating to measures to assist LDC members. He was not, however, suggesting that the CTD either endorse or tie itself rigidly into this typology. The third consideration that needed to be borne in mind in order to guide the CTD's work is that there appeared to be a near-universal acknowledgement that special and differential provisions had not contributed satisfactorily to the integration of developing countries into international trade. He said that Members would all agree that that the provisions relating to special and differential treatment, and its application, needed to be refined so that they were more responsive to the particular problems faced by Members with respect to international trade and the multilateral trading system. He noted that one of the CTD's tasks was to contribute to this process. With these preliminary comments, the Chairman opened the floor for suggestions by Members.","WTCOMTDM29.pdf","Chairman, CTD, Committee, CTD, CTD, Chairman, CTD, WTO, Chairman, CTD, WTO, Members, CTD, CTD, Members, Members, CTD, Chairman, Members"
"2600",2600,"55","55.     The representative of India recalled the statement made by his ambassador during the Seminar on Special and Differential Treatment held in March 2000, which said that special and differential treatment was one of the major problems faced by developing countries in regard to the implementation of WTO Agreements, and that the major concern was the non-binding and non-operational nature of special and differential treatment provisions in WTO Agreements. His delegation reiterated that having provisions that were devoid of any operational significance or legal enforceability was unsatisfactory, creating a false impression that benefits were accruing to developing countries. His delegation was of the view that, under the General Council process, special and differential provisions needed to be given an operational content and be made legally binding. Recalling that another participant at the Seminar on Special and Differential Treatment had made comments to the effect that special and differential treatment constituted an exception to the rules of the multilateral trading system and that the costs of such an exception needed to be evaluated, the representative of India recalled that his ambassador had responded by calling for an evaluation of the costs of exceptions to the multilateral rules of two major areas of export interest to developing countries, namely agriculture and textiles. India and other developing countries were desirous to see that binding and legally enforceable provisions for special and differential treatment were developed to reduce existing inequities in the multilateral trading system. The representative of India referred to paragraph 38 of document WT/COMTD/W/66, which reflected comments made by Egypt, and which stated that, ""It is obvious from the preceding analysis that a number of special and differential provisions have not been implemented, others have been partially implemented and a number of them WT/COMTD/M/29 Page 8 have been adequately implemented. Numerous special and differential provisions are vague and aspirational in nature and it is the collective responsibility of developed and developing countries alike to ensure that these provisions are translated into concrete benefits to developing countries."" India supported this statement, though it was of the view that only a very few special and differential provisions had been adequately implemented. Finally, his delegation was of the view that it would be useful to take into account proposals made in the preparatory process for the Seattle Ministerial Conference and in the special process of the General Council. In this connection, reference could be made to paragraph 23 of the note of the 28th Session of the CTD.","WTCOMTDM29.pdf","India, WTO, WTO, General, Council, India, India, India, Egypt, India, Seattle, Ministerial, Conference, General, Council, CTD"

He said that his delegation would expand on this issue under agenda Item K (as well as in the TRIPS Council).","WTCOMTDM29.pdf","Zambia, India"
"2602",2602,"57","57.      The representative of Pakistan said that special and differential treatment was one of the crucial aspects of the Uruguay Round Agreements, and that these provisions had been introduced for a variety of reasons. The prime reason was to provide developing countries with the opportunities to be on par with developed countries in terms of aspirations to development. He said that Pakistan, along with other Members, was convinced that the provisions for special and differential treatment contained in the Uruguay round had not been operative. The formulation of these provisions in a vague and ill-defined manner, largely in best-endeavour terms, had led to the problems now facing developing countries. The onerous nature of commitments undertaken by developing countries through the Uruguay Round Agreement was recognised, partially at least, at the time of concluding the agreements. The commitments were nevertheless undertaken in the belief that special and differential treatment would be provided, but unfortunately none of the provisions for special and differential treatment had been made operational. He said that the seminar held in March to discuss special and differential treatment had been useful. He echoed the Chairman in saying that, as work had begun on the question of Special and Differential Treatment in the context of the General Council, it was important to ensure that work undertaken in the CTD was not duplicative. He said that the CTD should focus on refining and redefining special and differential treatment to ensure that such treatment was made mandatory and binding.","WTCOMTDM29.pdf","Pakistan, Uruguay, Pakistan, Members, Uruguay, Uruguay, Chairman, General, Council, CTD, CTD"

As could be seen from the request circulated to Members, the economic and trade role of the League of Arab States was self explanatory, and would WT/COMTD/M/29 Page 2 undoubtedly facilitate the work of the WTO in dealing with Arab states in economic and trade fields, and would be a means of addressing issues connected to trade liberalisation in these countries and their integration into the multilateral trading system.","WTCOMTDM29.pdf","Egypt, League, of, Arab, States, Members, WTO, Arab"
"2617",2617,"70","70.      The Chairperson of the JAG said that the Joint Advisory Group on the ITC had held its 33rd Session in Geneva from 10 to 14 April 2000.                       Its report was contained in document ITC/AG(XXXIII)/181. The terms of reference of the JAG were to review the activities of the ITC and to formulate recommendations to the governing bodies of UNCTAD and the WTO. The Group had examined the following matters during its session: ITC's technical cooperation activities in 1999, based on its annual report; the report of the Consultative Committee on the ITC Global Trust Fund; the evaluation of ITC's trade information programme, a new ITC strategy for trade information services; and the report of the 1999 ITC technical meeting. The JAG had also taken note of ITC's contribution to the Medium Term Plan of the United Nations for the period 2002-2005. During the opening session, the Deputy Director General of WTO and the Officer-in-Charge of UNCTAD had praised the crucial role that the Executive Director of the ITC had played in developing and strengthening the ITC. The three organizations had cooperated within the framework of JITAP (Joint Integrated Technical Assistance Programme in Selected Least-Developed and Other African Countries) and were also joining forces in electronic commerce, an area of vital importance for the participation of developing countries in international trade. In his statement to the Group, Mr. Bélisle had given examples of ITC's contribution to capacity-building for trade development, which was the organization's overriding objective. The ITC had already been involved in multi-country capacity-building programmes such as JITAP and could build sustainable capacities cost-effectively in a large number of countries through global programmes like the World Trade Net. During the review of ITC's technical cooperation activities in 1999, the JAG had noted that ITC's forward- looking orientation in technical assistance products and services had positioned it well to respond to the rising needs and expectations of partner countries. The JAG had adopted the Report of the Committee on the Global Trust Fund as well as the new strategy for Trade Information Services and had taken note of ITC's contribution to the Medium Term Plan of the United Nations for the period 2002-2005. As was practice each year, government representatives had announced or confirmed voluntary contributions to the ITC. On behalf of the JAG, she expressed gratitude to the Governments of Canada, Cyprus, China, Denmark, France, India, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland and Turkey as well as the Islamic Development Bank and the Agence Intergouvernementale de la Francophonie.","WTCOMTDM29.pdf","Chairperson, JAG, Joint, Advisory, Group, ITC, Geneva, ITC, UNCTAD, WTO, Group, ITC, Consultative, Committee, ITC, Global, Trust, Fund, ITC, ITC, ITC, ITC, United, Nations, Director, WTO, UNCTAD, Director, ITC, ITC, Joint, Integrated, Technical, Assistance, Programme, Group, Bélisle, ITC, ITC, ITC, JAG, ITC, Committee, Global, Trust, Fund, Trade, Information, Services, ITC, United, Nations, ITC, JAG, Canada, Cyprus, China, Denmark, France, India, Italy, Netherlands, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland, Turkey, Islamic, Development, Bank"

"2619",2619,"72","72.     The Executive Director of the ITC congratulated the Chairman for his election to chair the important Committee on Trade and Development and thanked him for the time and opportunity given to them to share with the Committee some of the work done by ITC to support that of the WTO in the technical assistance field. His impression was that it was not known to all precisely how the ITC tried to complement the efforts of the WTO. Given that the Committee was discussing technical cooperation from various angles that day, it was especially opportune to be able to elaborate on ITC's work following Ambassador Seifert's presentation. First, the best of ITC's efforts were targeted towards exporting small and medium-size enterprises (SMEs), particularly from LDCs. Second, all of ITC's work relating to the WTO was done in very close collaboration and friendship with the WTO Secretariat. He asked Mr. Badrinath, the Director of the Trade Support Services Division at ITC, to give a brief overview of what was being done to support WTO's efforts in technical assistance and elaborate on one specific tool to give the Committee an example of what it meant in everyday work.

"2620",2620,"73","73.      A representative of the ITC said that ITC's work on technical cooperation complemented that of the WTO in three different areas: policy and rule-making work, normative and research work, and technical assistance activities. The focus of ITC's technical cooperation was the business community and business support institutions, particularly SMEs in developing and transition economies, with special attention paid to those in LDCs. All activities were carried out in close consultation with the WTO's Technical Cooperation Division and other substantive divisions, be they field-based programs or preparation of business-guides or training and technical materials. ITC's value-added was its experience of over 35 years in providing technical assistance, its institutional competence, tools, techniques and skills for delivery as well as its combination of approaches which had been developed over the years. Broadly, the approach of the ITC involved needs assessments, using a mixture of global, regional, and country projects, concentrating on national capacity building, promoting partnerships and network building in the field, and making the fullest use of advanced technologies for delivering technical cooperation. In the area of the multilateral trading system, the programmes had three major objectives: improving the trade performance of the business sector, especially the SMEs; building national capacity so that the business community could benefit from the multilateral trading system; concentrating on enterprises, associations, Chambers of Commerce, the legal community; and facilitating and enriching the dialogue between the public and private sectors so as to incorporate effectively the views of the business community in shaping the multilateral trading system. ITC would present to the CTD more detail on some features of the World Trade Net, an important programme of ITC. Members were welcome to visit them at the ITC or virtually on the web-site to obtain more information. The World Trade Net was only one example of an entire range of activities covered by ITC's various programmes, including the Integrated Framework and JITAP, where the WTO was a joint-implementer. ITC had a large number of country programmes as well as sector and function specific programmes, covering areas such as services, SPS, TBT, public procurement, apparels, textiles and clothing among others. The genesis of the World Trade Net programme had been the 1996-1999 Uruguay Round Follow-up Programme, which had been centered around a Business Guide to the Uruguay Round. The Guide was an easy to read publication, published in English, French, and Spanish, explaining the Uruguay Round Agreements. Some countries had also taken the initiative to translate it into other languages. The Guide had been disseminated through 160 seminars in over 70 countries. The rich experience gained, thanks to feedback and questions from the business community and government counterparts, had paved the way for the ITC to plan and prepare for the World Trade Net Programme. Broadly, the output of the programme was easy-to-read business guides: the new Business Guide to the World Trading System, copies of which were available outside the meeting room, and the Business Guide to the GATS. It also included training materials, including for training the trainers. A web-site and web-based services had been developed, which would be the focus of a more detailed presentation that day. All material of the World Trade Net, most of which was available in English, French and Spanish, was accessible for all members of the ITC, whether they were Members of the WTO or not. At the moment, the web-site was only in English, but the French and Spanish versions would be ready by the end of the year. In addition, there were some full members of the World Trade Net, which were the motivated and committed partners receiving additional assistance in the field under the programme. At present, 15 countries were full members and 12 were waiting to be incorporated into the programme. Other countries would be considered for full membership in a phased manner.","WTCOMTDM29.pdf","ITC, ITC, WTO, ITC, WTO, Technical, Cooperation, Division, ITC, ITC, Chambers, of, Commerce, ITC, ITC, Members, ITC, ITC, Integrated, Framework, WTO, ITC, SPS, TBT, Uruguay, Round, Follow-up, Programme, Uruguay, Round, Uruguay, ITC, World, Trade, Net, Programme, GATS, ITC, Members, WTO, World, Trade, Net"
"2621",2621,"74","74.      Following the general introduction, a second representative of the ITC said that she would take the Members on a guided tour through the more practical aspects of their work. The World Trade Net provided information, training and advice to the business community on the whole range of WTO related issues and aimed to facilitate the integration of business sector views into national trade negotiation strategies. Their main partners in the different networks were business associations. While the composition of network partners differed in every country, they included WTO focal points in different ministries, trade promotion officials, academia, consultants, lawyers, business trainers. WTO Reference Centers and regional institutions were also partners in the networks. All interested players were invited to join the network and were encouraged to interact, exchange information, and WT/COMTD/M/29 Page 12 cooperate among themselves. The basic condition for a country to participate in the World Trade Net was simply the active interest expressed by the public and the private sectors in that country. Considerations for extending the network included the potential for synergy affects with other ITC activities and with activities by other donors as well as the intention to create a geographically diverse network with member countries at different levels of development. The training and reference materials provided to all ITC members comprised practical training packs, business cases written by members based on their experiences and concerns in trying to adjust their business strategies to the changes in the multilateral trading system. ITC provided a service answering questions related to the changes concerning business operations emanating from the multilateral trading system. Last but not least, the web-site of the programme was an additional tool, not replacing the other tools, but helping to create another channel of better communication and access to information by network members. Using a power-point presentation, the representative of the ITC demonstrated the various features of the web-site. The web-site had been utilised to provide information about video-conferences, which had provided opportunities for network partners to comment on and update their knowledge about the on-going negotiations on the GATS and discuss developments in their respective countries. The up-coming video conference on the GATS and the export of services was organized in cooperation with the World Bank Distance Learning System and would be hosted in Bangkok, Thailand, with participation from Malaysia, Philippines and experts from Switzerland. Another one had already been hosted out of Sri Lanka with participation from Pakistan, Nepal, and Bangladesh. The ""what's new"" section of the web-site included a newsletter on developments in the WTO and was sent monthly to about 400 e-mail addresses. Overviews of the Business Guides were also available on the web-site, including a section on most frequently asked questions, which had been compiled during seminars with business representatives. The most important part of the web-site was the information about the networks and member countries, which allowed partners from different networks to interact, exchange information, and cooperate. The core of the World Trade Net Programme was the action plans and activities implemented by its members through the networks. ITC helped with those activities through kick-off meetings and joint-planning. The World Trade Net was neither a web-site, nor mere support from Geneva, but was the accomplishment of network members.","WTCOMTDM29.pdf","ITC, Members, WTO, WTO, WTO, Reference, Centers, ITC, ITC, ITC, ITC, GATS, GATS, World, Bank, Distance, Learning, System, Bangkok, Thailand, Malaysia, Philippines, Switzerland, Sri, Lanka, Pakistan, Nepal, Bangladesh, WTO, World, Trade, Net, Programme, ITC, Geneva"

The representative of Mexico thanked the ITC, particularly Mr Bélisle and his team for the advanced programmes they were developing, particularly by using electronic media.               In November 1999 his delegation had suggested that ITC use video conferencing and had been told at the time that there were obstacles, which seemed to have been resolved in the meantime. His delegation welcomed the use of video conferencing, which would support the technical cooperation work of the ITC, complementing the work of the WTO and UNCTAD. He hoped that ITC's work in the area of technical cooperation would be discussed further during the forthcoming Days of Reflection on technical cooperation.","WTCOMTDM29.pdf","Mexico, ITC, Mr, Bélisle, ITC, ITC, WTO, UNCTAD, ITC"
"2624",2624,"77","77.     The Executive Director of the ITC said that video conferencing had seemed difficult to arrange at the time the Mexican delegation had suggested it; however, since then ITC had made an arrangement with the World Bank Institute whereby ITC used their infrastructure at no cost and paid only for the telephone connection. The first conference, which had lasted almost two hours, had cost US$459.","WTCOMTDM29.pdf","Director, ITC, ITC, World, Bank, Institute, ITC"
"2625",2625,"78","78.     The representative of Zambia said that the LDCs were benefiting most from ITC activities. His delegation had always commended the role of the ITC especially in capacity building for trade focusing on enterprises. They applauded the work of Mr. Bélisle and his team on special programs for LDCs such as JITAP. While the WTO focused on rule-making and implementation, ITC had a complementary role, coaching enterprises in producing the right products, taking them to the right                                                                                       WT/COMTD/M/29                                                                                              Page 13 market, and helping them to integrate multilateral rules into their work. His delegation urged the ITC to continue its good work on linking multilateral rules with elements of capacity building. However, without increased financial support ITC would not be able to sustain its operations. He therefore thanked all donors supporting ITC and asked those with the means to join them.","WTCOMTDM29.pdf","Zambia, LDCs, ITC, ITC, Bélisle, LDCs, WTO, ITC, ITC, ITC, ITC"

"2632",2632,"84","84.      The representative of Bolivia said that the document WT/COMTD/W/65 called for a serious reflection by Members regarding the multilateral trading system they had created, and on the responsibilities which lay with different Members. For the small and vulnerable economies, whose exports were dominated by raw materials and agricultural products, the slow – or absence of – liberalisation in the agricultural sector and the textiles and clothing sectors had retarded the development of these sectors. Slow reforms in areas of export interest to small and vulnerable economies meant that there persisted tariff structures which acted as a disincentive impeding a better diversification of products. She said that the ultimate results of fluctuations in trade shares or the lack of market access were opportunities lost forever; lives cut short; underprivileged children, and excessive urbanisation. She said that said that these considerations seriously affected rural and urban environments, and made it difficult to do anything about enhancing the welfare of animals, since it was difficult to explain to the populace why the welfare of animals should be given consideration before its own. She said that Bolivia had adopted structural adjustment programmes and trade liberalisation policies, and had made many sacrifices, in order to generate much-needed growth. However, Bolivia had not received as a counterpart to its efforts, the opening of markets which would have lead to an increase in exports, and had indeed experienced chronic balance of payment deficits, making policy openness unsustainable, and politically unacceptable to the population. She said that in WT/COMTD/M/29 Page 14 this era of globalisation, it was necessary that each player assume his responsibilities. She asked how one could justify the resistance to change and opening up of access opportunities in favour of those economies that most needed such opportunities, which, if seized, could enable small and vulnerable economies to move out of their present condition. It was necessary to ensure that small and vulnerable economies received sufficient export revenues, in order for them to sustain their reforms.","WTCOMTDM29.pdf","Bolivia, Members, Members, Bolivia, Bolivia"
"2633",2633,"85","85.     The Chairman said that the trends in the trade of developing countries were evolving, and added that the CTD certainly needed to come back to this topic at a later date. He said that some time needed to pass before there was information on the trends the CTD had been discussing. It would be useful to come back to this in the middle of next year when Members could can have a meaningful update of the Secretariat paper. Of course, if there were to be any important rapid developments, the option was also open to revert to the issue earlier. It was proposed that the next update of the paper could be planned for sometime in 2001.","WTCOMTDM29.pdf","Chairman, CTD, CTD, Members, Secretariat"

"2635",2635,"87","87.      The Director of the Technical Cooperation Division, Mr. Léger, indicated that in 1999 the WTO carried out some 382 technical assistance activities, representing a 24 per cent increase over 1998. In 1999, such activities took place in 127 countries of which 100 were WTO Members, 20 countries and territories negotiating their accession to WTO, and seven were countries expressing an interest in joining WTO. The activities conducted in 1999 respected the guidelines for WTO technical cooperation issued by the CTD in October 1996, that is to say, the Secretariat followed a demand-driven-approach, ensured as much as possible a geographical balance among the different regions of the world, and also gave a priority to LDCs. However, regarding the number of activities identified as part of the three-year plan for the year 1999, only 52 per cent were actually carried out (79 missions). These in turn represented only 21 per cent of the total technical cooperation activities carried out in 1999. If the activities planned for 1998 that were in fact carried out in 1999 were added, the percentage increased from 21 to 30 per cent. Therefore, 70 per cent of all technical assistance activities carried out by the WTO in 1999 were not identified in the three-year plan. Concerning activities undertaken by WTO together with other international organizations, 41 per cent were fully organized by the WTO; an additional 23 per cent were organized jointly with another international organization; and invitations for WTO to conferences, seminars and workshops represented 36 per cent of activities conducted in 1999.","WTCOMTDM29.pdf","Director, Technical, Cooperation, Division, Léger, WTO, WTO, Members, WTO, WTO, WTO, CTD, Secretariat, WTO, WTO, WTO, WTO"
"2636",2636,"88","88.     Mr. Léger noted that, in 1999, the largest number of activities took place in Africa with 106; the largest percentage increase, however, was in Latin America and the Caribbean, where 100 activities were undertaken. This was due in large part to WTO's collaboration with the Institute for the Integration of Latin America and the Caribbean, the training arm of the Inter-American Development Bank, and cooperation with the Organization of American States. Regarding mode of supply in 1999, WTO undertook more national seminars than regional seminars, indicating a tendency for subjects presented to be more narrowly focused. There was a sharp drop in regional seminars, from 71 to 51, and a sharp increase in symposia, workshops and training courses, from 106 in 1998 to 173 in 1999, again underlining the trend towards more specialized activities. Finally, in 1999 there was an increase in both general-type seminars and more focused technical missions, although the rate of increase was larger for more specialized types of missions.","WTCOMTDM29.pdf","Léger, Africa, Latin, America, Caribbean, WTO, Institute, for, the, Integration, of, Latin, America, Caribbean, Inter-American, Development, Bank, Organization, of, American, States, WTO"
"2637",2637,"89","89.   Mr. Léger referred to Annex 2 of the report identifying the activities held under the Integrated Framework and under JITAP, a joint programme with UNCTAD and ITC. In 1999, 67 missions were                                                                                      WT/COMTD/M/29                                                                                             Page 15 related to these two programmes. Regarding budgetary aspects, he noted that voluntary extra-budgetary contributions accounted for more than 90 per cent of funding, and stressed that this heavy dependence on voluntary contributions made it difficult to plan technical assistance. Thus increasing the regular budget for technical assistance remained a major priority. He also noted the shortage of human resources for technical assistance. This, he said, was a very urgent problem in view of the fact that more requests were being received from developing countries to assist them in the negotiations on agriculture and services. Finally, he said, one element that should not be forgotten was the process of continuous renewal of developing countries' administrations, with a steady stream of new government officials requiring training on WTO Agreements.","WTCOMTDM29.pdf","Léger, Integrated, Framework, UNCTAD, ITC, WTO"

"2639",2639,"90","90.      Referring to the budget, Mr. Léger noted that money spent so far in 1999 (i.e. up to July) amounted to SwF6.05 million against projected expenditures of SwF10 million for the whole year. A large number of activities could not be carried out because of a shortfall in financing; human resources were also stretched to the limit. He recalled that five years ago the WTO conducted 79 missions, compared to 382 last year; the increase in human resources that the organization had received over the years for technical cooperation, not only in the Technical Cooperation Division, but in all divisions, was not commensurate with the increase in the number of activities.","WTCOMTDM29.pdf","Léger, WTO, Technical, Cooperation, Division"
"2640",2640,"91","91.      The representative of Egypt noted with approval a certain tendency to holding more national than regional seminars and more specialized ones rather than those of a general nature. Coupled with this issue was the relationship with the limited financial and human resources of the Secretariat. Some requests submitted to the Technical Cooperation Division for holding national seminars or specialized training courses were still pending, possibly due to lack of human or financial resources; while others were being addressed through regional or general seminars. The representative had doubt that regional or general seminars were very important and of very considerable benefit to some countries, but such seminars should take place among ""harmonized"" countries in terms of their levels of economic development, so that the exchange of views could be beneficial to all. Finally, the representative stressed that technical assistance was an educational process that should be done through the means identified by the requesting country, which was in the best position to know its needs.","WTCOMTDM29.pdf","Egypt, Secretariat, Technical, Cooperation, Division"
"2641",2641,"92","92.      The representative of Switzerland first referred to the report's conclusion, once again, the financing basis for technical assistance was insufficient and not stable enough, due to the fact that no solution had yet been found with regard to using funds from the regular budget. Switzerland regretted this situation, believing firmly that strong support for technical assistance in the regular budget was necessary and for that reason it should be increased.","WTCOMTDM29.pdf","Switzerland, Switzerland"
"2642",2642,"93","93.      Commenting on the report presented by Mr. Léger, he reported a criticism made previously that it was too much geared to a purely quantitative presentation. The value of this information may be interesting for statistics, but was of limited use for determining the value of technical assistance and for deciding future policy on technical assistance. On the other hand, he would have expected to find some indication in the report of the money spent while executing individual activities, i.e. some indication on where, in what areas, and on what activities the SwF6.05 million francs mentioned had been spent.","WTCOMTDM29.pdf","Léger"
"2643",2643,"94","94.      Turning to planning, he noted that 70 per cent of all activities carried out in the previous year did not have a reference in the three-year plan. On the one hand, this was a clear sign that the three-year plan, as a potentially useful working and planning instrument, was not yet where it should be. On the other hand, Members as demandeurs should take much of the blame because the WTO Secretariat was not necessarily in the position to reject ad hoc requests. In that context, he wondered whether the term ""demand-driven"" was not confused with the term ""ad hoc"". He was not convinced that it should be ""understandable"" that ""countries often cannot anticipate a specific need long in advance"". This might have been understandable in the first couple of years after the WTO came into WT/COMTD/M/29 Page 16 being; however, now it should be possible for Members to estimate their needs in advance and to organize technical assistance in a longer perspective. He suggested that the Secretariat could also do more against this ""ad hocism"", through a well-designed technical assistance programme with a longer and sustainable perspective. This would assure that assistance teams were not constantly called into countries on an ad hoc basis. By designing longer-term technical assistance programmes it would easier to reject ad hoc calls; in addition, such long-term programmes would certainly also yield longer lasting benefits than just ad hoc interventions.","WTCOMTDM29.pdf","Members, WTO, Secretariat, WTO, Members, Secretariat"

The representative of the European Communities first announced that the Kingdom of Sweden had decided to give additional funding this year to the Global Trust Fund of SwF1.3 million or Skr7 million. He thanked the Secretariat for the report, which gave a good overview of what was being done in the field of technical assistance. Positive aspects were that the call for greater regional cooperation and for outsourcing of activities seemed to have been heard, at least through involving more organizations - although he noted in passing the WCO was not mentioned while WIPO and other regional organizations received attention. He encouraged the Secretariat to pursue this particular avenue as far as possible. Building on a question raised by Switzerland, he said that it was not a very good basis for a discussion with donor agencies to say that ""the number of activities has increased by 24 per cent"". Some of these activities might be very short, involving one official, while others may be very long involving several officials. It would be better to argue how human resources needs have risen, or how needs have been diminished by using outsourcing. He also asked why countries could not foresee their needs in advance, and why there was so much ""ad hocism"". If 48 per cent of planned activities could not take place, something was wrong. A more structured approach to technical assistance should be taken. Thirdly, he noted that the training packages developed by WTO should play a bigger role. Fuller use should be made of these and even more could be done. Lastly, regarding the funding and human resources, he asked whether activities that had not been carried out because of lack of funding could have been done if the money had been there, in other words, there were adequate human resources?","WTCOMTDM29.pdf","Kingdom, of, Sweden, Secretariat, WCO, WIPO, Secretariat, Switzerland, WTO"
"2645",2645,"96","96.      The representative of India said that his Government had participated in several activities organized by WTO or with other organizations. He felt that much more could be done in the field; the main problem was lack of manpower and funding to cope with the increased demand. If technical cooperation was to be effective, it should go beyond the present endeavour to organize workshops to explain the provisions of the agreements, and instead focus on the exchange of technology and scientific know-how to help developing countries better access the global markets and integrate themselves into the world economic order. He agreed with the parts of the report on Agriculture, SPS, and Services. For TBT he agreed that technical cooperation seminars should focus on assisting developing countries in meeting the requirements of standards, technical regulations and conformity assessment procedures in their main export markets. He also emphasized the need for help for developing countries to develop their human and institutional resources; and finally, he stated that support to regional coordination and cooperation in assistance to small and medium-size enterprises in developing countries to benefit fully from the WTO system were also necessary.","WTCOMTDM29.pdf","India, WTO, Agriculture, SPS, TBT, WTO"
"2646",2646,"97","97.     The representative of Japan thanked the Secretariat for the two excellent reports on technical assistance activities and on evaluation. She would comment once full remarks were received from the Capital. Japan considered that developing countries fully recognized and were convinced that they can benefit from the multilateral trading system. Japan supported technical assistance to help the developing countries integrate better into the multilateral trading system and acknowledged the importance for WTO to coordinate its work with the bilateral donor countries and other international organizations that provide technical assistance in the field of trade, in particular World Bank, UNCTAD and ITC, to make it more efficient and effective.","WTCOMTDM29.pdf","Japan, Secretariat, Japan, Japan, WTO, World, Bank, UNCTAD, ITC"
"2647",2647,"98","98.     The representative of United States welcomed the improved organization and format of the reports and emphasized that the evaluation of the effectiveness of technical cooperation activities                                                                                    WT/COMTD/M/29                                                                                           Page 17 would be an important complement to the discussion of the reports. She emphasized the importance of coordination in technical assistance; recognizing that there could be some difficulty in internal coordination at the national level in countries receiving assistance, she also sought more information about coordination within the WTO Secretariat, particularly since a number of Divisions are involved; in particular, how technical cooperation was coordinated and whether there was a specific strategy for avoiding overlap and duplication of internal activities. She also reiterated the importance of coordination with other organizations. Noting that ITC had maximized outsourcing possibilities, she sought a better strategy for dealing with WTO's technical assistance. The United States had made suggestions in the Sub-Committee for Least-Developed Countries and the General Council in respect to improvements in technical cooperation and on the Integrated Framework. Her delegation would look very carefully at the review taking place and would comment on that, as it would be very significant for future technical cooperation activities. She also recognized the need also to be more informative about the bilateral technical assistance the United States and other donors were providing, and hoped that a better picture of the effective use of technical cooperation would emerge.","WTCOMTDM29.pdf","United, States, WTO, Secretariat, ITC, WTO, United, States, General, Council, United, States"
"2648",2648,"99","99.       The representative of Norway expressed his delegation's agreement to seeking an evaluation of technical cooperation. However, a thorough consideration by the CTD would have been facilitated if all the reports had been available well in advance of the meeting. As a general comment, he stated that it would have been useful if the report had included an explicit reference to the strategy behind WTO's technical assistance activities, with objectives and priorities clearly stated. With this, the CTD would have been better able to undertake a comprehensive review of the 1999 report and to consider the different elements to which reference was made in the report.","WTCOMTDM29.pdf","Norway, CTD, WTO, CTD"

The Chairman recalled that the MERCOSUR Working Party, which was established by the GATT 1947 Committee on Trade and Development in May 1993, had not been able to meet since then. For the Working Party to operate under GATT 1994, an adaptation of its terms of reference was needed - and that required a formal Decision by the Committee on Trade and Development. Also of relevance were the transitional arrangements adopted by the General Council on 31 January 1995, which applied to regional arrangements and by implication to the MERCOSUR Agreement. From a procedural point of view, adaptation of the original terms of reference was necessary, since they stated that the Working Party would report to the GATT 1947 Committee on Trade and Development and also mentioned the CONTRACTING PARTIES and the Council, bodies transformed under GATT 1994.","WTCOMTDM3.pdf","Chairman, MERCOSUR, Working, Party, GATT, 1947, Committee, on, Trade, and, Development, Working, Party, GATT, Committee, on, Trade, and, Development, General, Council, Working, Party, GATT, 1947, Committee, on, Trade, and, Development, GATT"

The Chairman indicated that the draft text of the modified terms of reference for the MERCOSUR Working Party (document WT/COMTD/W/3) followed the substance of those agreed for the 1995 Working Party on the Enlargement of the European Communities. He proposed the adoption of the following terms of reference: ""To examine the Southern Common Market Agreement (MERCOSUR) in the light of the relevant provisions of the Enabling Clause and of the GATT 1994, including Article XXIV, and to transmit a report and recommendations to the Committee on Trade and Development for submission to the General Council, with a copy of the report transmitted as well to the Council for Trade in Goods. The examination in the Working Party will be based on a complete notification and on written questions and answers"". These terms of reference should be read together with the following Understanding: ""It is understood that the statement read out be the Chairman of the Council for Trade in Goods under item 7 of the Agenda of its meeting on 20 February 1995, as contained in document WT/REG3/1, applies mutatis mutandis to this Working Party.""

"2667",2667,"5","5.       The Chairman briefly commented on some relevant issues which would be discussed at the next meeting of the Committee on Trade and Development. On the subject of observership, he recalled that this matter was still outstanding in the General Council, and that the Committee had been deciding at each meeting which organizations it would invite for its next meeting. The Chairman informed the Committee that in August 1995, he received a letter from the Director-General of UNIDO requesting observer status in the Committee, and that he had asked the Secretariat to reply that a definitive response could not be given as the issue of observership was being considered by the General Council. However, in light of the interim procedures under which the Committee on Trade and Development was working, he invited comments on whether UNIDO could be invited to the next meeting of the Committee on Trade and Development. In response to a question posed by the representative of the European Communities, the Chairman indicated that UNIDO did not have observer status in the GATT 1947 Committee on Trade and Development. In the absence of further comments and in light of the ad hoc procedures, he proposed that the Committee on Trade and Development agree to invite a representative of UNIDO to its Fourth Session as well as all the organizations that were invited to its Third Session. The Committee so agreed.","WTCOMTDM3.pdf","Chairman, Committee, on, Trade, and, Development, General, Council, Committee, Chairman, Committee, Director-General, UNIDO, Committee, Secretariat, General, Council, Committee, on, Trade, and, Development, UNIDO, Committee, on, Trade, and, Development, European, Communities, Chairman, UNIDO, GATT, Committee, on, Trade, and, Development, Committee, on, Trade, and, Development, UNIDO, Committee"
"2668",2668,"6","6.       Turning to the forthcoming meeting of the Committee on Trade and Development, the Chairman indicated that it would take place on Friday, 17 November 1995. He would propose an agenda based on the agreed programme of work in addition to two items from the last meeting of the Committee on Trade Development: i.e. (i) review of the impact of the results of the Uruguay Round on developing country Members, in particular on the least-developed country Members; and (ii) consideration of measures and initiatives to assist the expansion of trade and investment opportunities of developing country Members, in particular the least-developed country Members. Under this last item, the question of credit and recognition for autonomous trade liberalization measures could be discussed further and, the net food-importing developing countries' issue would also be addressed. The Chairman recalled that background documentation had been circulated by the Secretariat for the July meeting. Items deriving from the programme of work were (i) review of the participation of developing country Members in the multilateral trading system; (ii) review of the application of special provisions in the WTO system in favour of developing country Members, and in particular least-developed country Members, including the supervision of the implementation of Part IV and the Enabling Clause and the annual report of the Committee of Participating Countries on the operation of the Protocol Relating to Trade Negotiations Among Developing Countries; (iii) annual review of WTO technical cooperation activities as they relate to developing country Members; (iv) work of the Sub-Committee on Least-Developed Countries; and (v) future work programme of the Committee on Trade and Development. The Chairman expressed the hope that at the next meeting, constructive comments would be made, for the benefit of the Committee itself and of all developing country Members.","WTCOMTDM3.pdf","Committee, on, Trade, and, Development, Chairman, Committee, Uruguay, Members, Members, Members, Members, Chairman, Secretariat, Members, WTO, Members, Members, Committee, of, Participating, Countries, WTO, Members, Committee, on, Trade, and, Development, Chairman, Committee, Members"
"2669",2669,"7","7.       On the question of notification requirements, the Chairman indicated that the seminar on notification obligations had been very useful and instructive. He recalled that the GATT 1947 Committee on Trade and Development dealt with notification requirements in 1965, 1966 and 1980; however, not all decisions taken on those occasions, were strictly followed and a number of points remained unsettled. He was of the view that given the importance the WTO attaches to notification obligations as exemplified by the establishment of a Working Group on Notification Obligations and Procedures, the Committee should devote some time to reviewing the notification requirements of the texts it had been given responsibility for - i.e. Article XVIII:A, C and D, Part IV, and the Enabling Clause. He                                                                         WT/COMTD/M/3                                                                         Page 3 asked delegations to reflect on this matter so as to allow a first exchange of views at the Committee on Trade and Development's November meeting. Following a request made by the representative of Argentina, the Chairman indicated that the Secretariat would circulate documents containing notification obligations related to development issues as well as past decisions of the Committee on Trade and Development on this matter. The Committee took note of the comments made.","WTCOMTDM3.pdf","Chairman, GATT, Committee, on, Trade, and, Development, WTO, Working, Group, on, Notification, Obligations, and, Procedures, Committee, Page, Committee, on, Trade, and, Development, Argentina, Chairman, Secretariat, Committee, on, Trade, and, Development, Committee"

"2676",2676,"101","101.    As Chairman, I have deduced from the discussion during the two Days of Reflection a clear recognition of the link between trade-related technical assistance, trade and development, and of technical assistance as a core function of the WTO. The discussions have also led me to reflect on whether WTO technical assistance should not perhaps logically have two foci: a narrower focus on providing information on and promoting implementation of the WTO Agreements, and a related role in support of broader trade and development strategy, in which WTO's technical cooperation should, as appropriate, be coordinated with and reinforce development assistance provided by other organizations and institutions within their areas of competence, as well as in some cases by bilateral donors. These two elements seem to me to pervade the discussion of objectives, ways and means, and disposal and use of resources for technical cooperation and, it seems to me, should be a basis for the discussion of strategy and modalities for the WTO's technical cooperation in the future.","WTCOMTDM30.pdf","Chairman, WTO, WTO, WTO, WTO, WTO"

Among the issues on which he thought Members would want to continue to reflect were: how best to balance planning needs against urgent demands; how to balance demands against budget and personnel constraints; what should be the substantive content of the seminars; how best to deliver technical cooperation on the one hand, through regional or national and, on the other hand, through specialised or more general seminars; how best to collaborate with other international and national agencies; and how the success of WTO technical cooperation function on an ongoing basis might effectively be monitored, and how ideas for improvement could be taken up.","WTCOMTDM30.pdf","Chairman, CTD, WTO, Members, WTO"
"2697",2697,"29","29.      The representative of Norway welcomed the Chairman's report on the ""Days of Reflection"", which was a useful summary of the themes raised. Norway clearly agreed with several points in the report, such as the need for a clear strategy for technical cooperation in the WTO; the need to reduce dependence on ad hoc initiatives; and the need to address the serious underfunding of WTO technical cooperation. His delegation reminded the CTD of Norway's strong conviction that the WTO's technical assistance activities should be made part of the regular WTO budget, while not precluding voluntary contributions. The inclusion of the financing of these activities on the regular budget was necessary to ensure the stable and predictable funding base of the Secretariat's planning of technical assistance. More information was needed on what was meant in concrete terms by the reference to the need to involve the private sector. Was this a reference to possible private funding of WTO         1             See Annex, pp.16-20. WT/COMTD/M/30 Page 4 technical assistance activities, or was it a reference to the role private actors such as academia and NGOs could play in technical assistance programmes at the national level? His delegation sounded a word of caution regarding the role of the WTO in technical cooperation. As Norway saw it, this role was clearly linked to submitting information, building capacity, and providing training concerning the various rights and obligations that existed in the WTO Agreements. Norway did not foresee a role for the WTO in technical assistance activities of a more general, developmental nature. Such activities were to be left to other organisations such as the World Bank, the IMF, the UNDP, and the UNCTAD, as well as bilateral donors. The WTO's technical cooperation activities needed to be coordinated with those of other partners, and trade-related technical assistance needed to be better integrated into general development projects and programmes.","WTCOMTDM30.pdf","Norway, Chairman, Norway, WTO, WTO, CTD, Norway, WTO, WTO, Secretariat, WTO, WTO, Norway, WTO, Norway, WTO, World, Bank, IMF, UNDP, UNCTAD, WTO"

"2699",2699,"30","30.      The representative of Bangladesh was sorry not to have been able to attend the ""Days of Reflection"". Like other LDCs, Bangladesh looked forward to more enhanced levels of technical cooperation. His delegation generally supported what had been said by the representative of Norway, particularly the need to place the funding of WTO technical cooperation on a firm footing through the regular budget. He said that another point of the report that had attracted his delegation's attention was the need for priority for technical assistance programmes for LDCs. Regarding the role of the Integrated Framework (IF), he said that Bangladesh was disappointed by the fact that the IF had not performed as well as expected. He added that the IF, hamstrung as it was, was being saddled with extra responsibilities. It seemed to be becoming a coordination mechanism of sorts, and there was also the additional, and not fully understood, issue of integrating the IF into the PRSP process. He felt that the IF should be left as it was conceived to be.","WTCOMTDM30.pdf","Bangladesh, Bangladesh, Norway, WTO, Bangladesh"
"2700",2700,"31","31.      The representative of Switzerland said the ""Days of Reflection"" had been quite useful, and that the Chairman's report adequately summarised the proceedings of the event. He said that it was necessary to work out a clear strategy in the months to come, with a clear definition of objectives, and a logical sequencing of technical assistance activities. This was, however, unlikely to solve another major problem in the delivery of technical assistance activities: as the Chairman's report pointed out, it was difficult to programme technical cooperation activities when only a minority of beneficiary countries responded to the planning questionnaires. He said that the ad hoc nature of technical assistance delivery was not primarily a problem of the WTO Secretariat, since the Secretariat was not necessarily in a position to reject an ad hoc request by a country official. Therefore, Switzerland was of the view that the CTD should give support to the Secretariat, by enabling it to take measures which would make the three-year plan a more reliable planning instrument. He said that there were several possibilities which could be envisioned to facilitate the programming of technical assistance activities an the early announcement of technical assistance needs. For instance, one possibility – which could be called a ""soft option"" – would be to name those countries which made extensive use of ad hoc requests. Another possibility was that the CTD should take a decision that the Secretariat should only accept requests which were made in due time, that is, in the autumn of the year preceeding the delivery of the activity. This would be a ""hard option"", but had the advantage of sensitising everyone to the fact that technical assistance had long-term effects, and that it needed to be carefully planned by beneficiary countries. A third possibility, which would build-in some flexibility to deal with urgent, ad hoc, requests would be to specify that ad hoc requests were not excluded per se, but that they would be only accepted on condition that the requesting country partially participate in the financing of the activity. Switzerland proposed that the Secretariat be mandated, as part of its current work on assessing and redefining technical assistance, to develop proposals on measures to reduce ad hoc requests, and therefore to make the three-year plan a more reliable instrument","WTCOMTDM30.pdf","Switzerland, Chairman, Chairman, WTO, Secretariat, Secretariat, Switzerland, CTD, Secretariat, CTD, Secretariat, Switzerland, Secretariat"
"2701",2701,"32","32.     The representative of the United States said that her delegation was of the view that the ""Days of Reflection"" had been useful, and had allowed for a closer focus on technical cooperation, which had become a significant and critical issue. Her delegation had made some suggestions during the days of reflection, and she hoped that these suggestions would be taken into account in any further work done by the Secretariat. Her delegation had also mentioned on a number of occasions the bi-                                                                                      WT/COMTD/M/30                                                                                              Page 5 lateral assistance provided by the United States. A compendium had been compiled of all technical assistance provided, a copy of which was to be distributed to the WTO, and the information contained therein was also accessible through the World Wide Web, at http://www.usaid.gov/. The compendium compiled information on technical assistance provided each region and the financial resources involved. She urged Members to consult the compendium, as this could be used to identify problems, and also possibilities for the use of technical assistance. She said that the question had once been raised in the CTD as to why the United States did not devote the resources it had been providing bi-laterally to fund technical assistance through the WTO. She said that while comments made in CTD meetings on the role of the Secretariat in the delivery of technical assistance were important, bi- lateral technical assistance was a fact of life, and had been taking place prior to, and independently of, the WTO's establishment and the GATT. She said that it was important for Members to coordinate the technical assistance they received from various sources, and that if there was a comprehensive approach to the use of technical assistance, the results would also be comprehensive. She said that the compendium was an example of how the United States coordinated its efforts in the delivery of technical assistance, and hoped that there would be similar efforts in coordination on the beneficiary side, so that the results of technical cooperation could be better realised. She said that the United States was to submit a contribution of SwF1 million to the Global Trust Fund, specifically for the Africa region, as a start, and that this money would cover WTO technical assistance for both least-developed countries and other developing African countries. The United States and the WTO Secretariat had evaluated how the funds would be utilised, and it was expected that a second contribution would be made in 2001 for other developing countries. She said that technical assistance provided by WTO experts was effective, and that the funds required for the delivery of such assistance would be available, but the United States was concerned that, irrespective of the source of technical assistance, there be better coordination on the donor, the WTO and the beneficiary sides, in order that the results of technical assistance delivery be optimal.","WTCOMTDM30.pdf","United, States, Secretariat, United, States, WTO, Members, CTD, United, States, WTO, Secretariat, WTO, GATT, Members, United, States, United, States, Global, Trust, Fund, Africa, WTO, United, States, WTO, Secretariat, WTO, United, States, WTO"

"2703",2703,"34","34.       The representative of the European Communities said that the Chairman had compiled in a clear and factual manner the proceedings of the ""Days of Reflection"". He said that the issues under discussion were complex, as evidenced by the number of points raised in the Chairman's report, which ranged from matters of budget, to matters of planning, to matters of scope and so forth. His delegation agreed with the issues identified by the Chairman, in the introductory section of his note, as being the most urgent ones. His delegation believed that the time had come to see how the report could be built on, given the clearer view that Members now had on the issues at stake. He said that discussions on technical assistance were not only advancing in the CTD, but elsewhere as well. He said that one of the tasks of the CTD would be to synthesise the common elements of the various discussions which were taking place. For instance, the TBT Committee had discussed what approach it could take to technical assistance, and the EC had also submitted its own proposal to the Committee on Customs Valuation. There was also an extensive discussion on the Integrated Framework, which also addressed questions such as funding, planning and scope, as well as the concept of ""mainstreaming"". He said that there was also a debate in the context of APEC, as well as the initiatives taken by donors at a bilateral level. Finally, he noted that the Director-General had sent out a questionnaire on these issues as well. He said that discussions should reflect these various initiatives, and that conclusions should be drawn on this basis. He said that Switzerland had made a concrete proposal regarding the planning of technical assistance activities, and that this was one way to start a concrete discussion. Another way to start concrete discussion was to be aware of the various discussions that were on-going, notably those surrounding the Integrated Framework, which were in many ways the leading discussions on technical assistance and which covered many areas of relevance to the delivery of technical assistance in general. He said that there had been proposals made to the effect that the principles of the Integrated Framework be extended to technical assistance in general in the WTO. He said that a general strategy based on all these points was an important WT/COMTD/M/30 Page 6 demand, though it was not clear who was in a position to write such a strategy. His main concern was that the various approaches pursued be pulled together, so that their essence may be distilled.","WTCOMTDM30.pdf","European, Communities, Chairman, Chairman, Chairman, Members, CTD, CTD, TBT, Committee, EC, Committee, on, Customs, Valuation, Integrated, Framework, APEC, Director-General, Switzerland, WTO"

In order that a more complete picture of the topics and issues for discussion that came out of the ""Days of Reflection"" be given, her delegation thought it important that account be taken of a specific proposal that had been made by her delegation, and endorsed by others, during the ""Days of Reflection"" to the effect that consideration should be given to the provision of funds to enable experts from capitals to attend meetings in Geneva in order to provide support for missions in Geneva that lacked adequate capacity. Such actions would ensure better implementation of agreements and a better compliance with commitments.","WTCOMTDM30.pdf","Colombia, Chairman, Geneva, Geneva"
"2705",2705,"36","36.      The representative of Haiti recalled that his delegation had intervened on a number of the themes identified in the report. He said he wished to emphasise three areas: cooperation with other inter-governmental agencies; technical cooperation in favour of least-developed countries; and the question of human resource requirements and the financial implications of such requirements. Regarding the question of cooperation with other inter-governmental agencies on matters of technical cooperation, his delegation had made concrete suggestions to the effect that Memoranda of Understanding (MoUs) signed between the WTO and various other inter-governmental organisations could have concrete results for the delivery of technical cooperation activities by the WTO. For instance, he had suggested that the conclusion of the MoU between the WTO and the UNIDO could be speeded up, so that there might be cooperation on matters related to industrial development. Referring to the ITC, and the mandate that the WTO had for close collaboration with this organisation, his delegation expressed surprise at what appeared to be, in the context of the implementation of the Integrated Framework, a reduction of the scope of cooperation with the ITC. He said that the ITC had been responsible for the Administrative Unit of the IF, which was now being handed over the WTO. He raised questions about this transfer of responsibilities, in view of the fact that there was already too much for the WTO to handle. With respect to the issue of technical cooperation in favour of least-developed countries, and the Integrated Framework, he recalled that his delegation had already expressed the concern that by anchoring technical cooperation in the activities of other agencies that the Integrated Framework was losing the focus of its mission, which was to address the trade-related concerns of least-developed countries. He said that linkages were being made between trade-related technical cooperation, and the UNDP's poverty reduction framework, and also with the World Bank's mission regarding poverty and development. While his delegation believed that particular attention needed to be given to poverty reduction, the IF was a complementary exercise, which was intended to focus on trade-related problems, and not social problems. If the IF was too closely attached to other poverty reduction programmes, then the IF as had been mandated by the Singapore Ministerial Conference would be diluted. Regarding human resource and financial resource needs, he said that the quest for core budgetary funding of technical cooperation had been on-going for two years. He said that prior to the Seattle Ministerial Conference, the proposal had been to stagger an amount of SwF10 million over a three-year period, whereas now it was proposed that the sum be provided over one year. In relation to the latter proposal, he noted that it had also been proposed that 75 per cent of this sum be devoted funding activities, while 25 per cent be devoted to human resources. His delegation requested clarification of what was meant by ""activities"". His delegation was also of the view that each Member should contribute towards the funds.","WTCOMTDM30.pdf","Haiti, MoUs, WTO, WTO, WTO, UNIDO, ITC, WTO, ITC, ITC, WTO, WTO, Integrated, Framework, Integrated, Framework, UNDP, World, Bank, Singapore, Ministerial, Conference, Seattle, Ministerial, Conference, Member"
"2706",2706,"37","37.     The representative of the Philippines said his delegation appreciated the value of the ""Days of Reflection"" and the report submitted by the Chairman, insofar as it covered issues of the management of technical cooperation. He said that the delivery of WTO technical assistance related to general development-oriented technical assistance provided by other agencies. He said that the value of the ""Days of Reflection"" would be determined by how the discussion of technical cooperation could be moved forward. He said that in moving the process forward, it was necessary to take into account the view of donors, beneficiaries, and the Secretariat. He said that a framework should be developed by                                                                                    WT/COMTD/M/30                                                                                            Page 7 the WTO Secretariat on how the programme of management could be worked out and consulted with the donors and beneficiaries. He said that he was unaware of any set of guidelines on how the technical cooperation programme worked, and what were the main and subsidiary objectives; and whether technical cooperation was accessible to all and on what criteria. He said that following the establishment of the WTO, there was huge demand for technical cooperation which had perhaps been unanticipated. It was on the basis of reflections that the WTO could craft certain guidelines on technical cooperation. He said that it was recognised that WTO operated in a wider setting, and, as had been demonstrated in discussions on the Integrated Framework, there as an increasing emphasis on mainstreaming trade policies into overall development strategies, including those related to poverty reduction. This was another paradigm which needed to be taken into account, and for which specific resources may need to be devoted. He said that there was a specific issue concerning collaboration with NGOs and the sharing of expenses, and there had been some positive experiences from both the ITC's and the UNCTAD's activities in this respect. He said that it was necessary for the WTO to consider all these issues and develop a common approach.","WTCOMTDM30.pdf","Philippines, Chairman, WTO, Secretariat, WTO, Secretariat, WTO, WTO, WTO, Integrated, Framework, ITC, UNCTAD, WTO"
"2707",2707,"38","38.      The representative of Haiti proposed that in order to develop concrete solutions to questions relating to the financing of projects under the Integrated Framework, the WTO should take up with the World Bank the idea that a quarter of resources generated by debt relief should be allocated to the funding of trade-related projects coming under the Integrated Framework. He said that this was a concrete area where the collaboration between the WTO and the World Bank could be effective.","WTCOMTDM30.pdf","Haiti, WTO, World, Bank, Integrated, Framework, WTO, World, Bank"
"2708",2708,"39","39.      The Director of the Technical Cooperation Division said that, in respect of least-developed countries, a separate Secretariat Working Group had been established. Regarding the transfer of the Integrated Framework's administrative unit from the ITC to the WTO, he said that this had been done to improve the administration of the IF, given that the person responsible for chairing the Inter- Agency Working Group was part of the WTO Secretariat. He said that other questions raised by Haiti could be addressed at the meeting of the Sub-Committee on LDCs. Regarding the relationship of the private sector to the development of technical assistance, he said that the question had not arisen from the point of view of funding, but rather from the perspective that the private sector was the engine of growth. Since this was the case, the view had been expressed that attendance by representatives of the private sector during WTO technical assistance activities would be beneficial. There was no intention that the WTO take over the mandate of the ITC. Regarding the need to consolidate the various ideas and proposals that had been expressed on the subject of technical assistance, the Director of the Technical Cooperation Division brought to the attention of the CTD a document that had been prepared by the Technical Cooperation Division, and circulated two days prior to the 30th Session, which was entitled ""A Strategy for Technical Assistance in the WTO"". The intention was to table the document at the 31st Session of the CTD. The document took into account all existing documents that had been prepared on technical cooperation since the establishment of the WTO, all the suggestions made at the ""Days of Reflection""; the chairman's report; and the recommendations of the two task- forces on technical assistance which had been set up over the previous two years. The document was structured into seven different sections. He said that the document was still far from complete, but constituted a first step. It provided in one single document coverage of many of the issues and elements raised by Members, and hopefully would assist Members in their deliberations on technical assistance. Regarding the question of the budget for 2001, he said that there was a section on technical assistance. There was paper which summarised a presentation given by Deputy Director-General Mr. A. Stoler. The text contained two tables, one outlining the fact that out of the 10 milion requested for 2001, some SwF2.5 million would relate to additional human resources, that is about 16 new positions across the whole of the WTO secretariat. A second table depicted what would be done with the other SwF7.5 million. The matrix was organised by subject and modes of delivery, and it covered developing countries and least-developed country members.","WTCOMTDM30.pdf","Director, Technical, Cooperation, Division, Secretariat, Working, Group, Integrated, Framework, ITC, WTO, Inter, -, Agency, Working, Group, WTO, Secretariat, Haiti, WTO, WTO, ITC, Director, Technical, Cooperation, Division, CTD, Technical, Cooperation, Division, WTO, CTD, WTO, chairman, Members, Members, Director-General, A., Stoler, WTO"

However, some Members indicated that they wished to revert to the consideration of two Secretariat documents: The Framework      for    Monitoring      and     Evaluating     the    WTO      Technical   Cooperation Activities (WT/COMTD/W/73) and Monitoring and Evaluation of the WTO's Technical Cooperation Activities – Manual for WTO's Secretariat Staff dealing with Technical Cooperation Activities (WT/COMTD/W/74). During the previous meeting, Members had raised a number of questions on the reports, and clarifications were given by the Secretariat. Members also made a number of suggestions for improvement in the reporting process in order to facilitate the monitoring of the WTO's technical cooperation activities. The Chairman said that the Secretariat was going to take these comments on board","WTCOMTDM30.pdf","Chairman, Members, Secretariat, WTO, Technical, Cooperation, Activities, WTO, WTO, Secretariat, Staff, Members, Secretariat, Members, WTO, Chairman, Secretariat"
"2712",2712,"42","42.      The representative of Norway thanked the Secretariat for the preparation of the document on a strategy for technical assistance. His delegation was of the view that such a document would be very useful as a point of departure for the evaluation of WTO technical assistance. His delegation were particularly interested as to how the Secretariat would spell out the niche that the WTO would occupy in the delivery of technical assistance, and how the WTO could cooperate with other agencies, without making such cooperation an added burden. His delegation welcomed proposals by Switzerland on how to tackle ad hoc requests for technical assistance. He said that in a number of cases, speedy action was needed on the part of beneficiary countries. On the other hand, a situation where ad hoc processes became dominant was one to be avoided. Specifically regarding documents WT/COMTD/W/73 and WT/COMTD/W/74, his delegation had sought expert advice. Their experts were of the view that the Secretariat approach disclosed a highly professional approach to monitoring as well as evaluation, and that the set-up was ""state of the art"". However, the experts warned against an approach in monitoring and evaluation that was too ambitious in relation to the realities at hand. While it may be useful to draw on UNDP and OECD models, these also had dimensions that were different from those which applied to the WTO. Norway advised the CTD to allow the Secretariat to implement its strategy progressively over a period of years. This was a pioneering activity in uncharted territory. Concerning monitoring and evaluation reports, his delegation noted that the Secretariat adopted a very positive attitude as they did not seek to point to errors or blame any party. While his delegation favoured a constructive attitude, it was also of the view that the Secretariat needed to be frank in assessing experiences, for its own benefit and that of the CTD, so that the CTD could be familiarised with both successes and failures. He said that much attention had been given to the Secretariat's role and its capacity to fill that role. However, its success in this depended on commitments made by other parties, namely donors and recipients. Regarding donors, his delegation had stressed the importance of integrating technical assistance fully into the regular WTO budget. No less important was follow-up of and feedback from recipients. Donors needed to know how their monies had been spent, and one aspect of long-term financing was the assessment of the recipients themselves on how the assistance had functioned, and its effects. His delegation recommended in future that the opportunity be given to recipients to express their assessment and advice.","WTCOMTDM30.pdf","Norway, Secretariat, WTO, Secretariat, WTO, WTO, Switzerland, Secretariat, UNDP, OECD, WTO, Norway, CTD, Secretariat, Secretariat, Secretariat, CTD, CTD, Secretariat, WTO"
"2713",2713,"43","43.     The representative of the Philippines said that his delegation shared Norway's appreciation of the Secretariat's efforts in producing the draft Strategy paper. He suggested that issues of monitoring and evaluation could be discussed later in the context of the overall strategy. He said that the draft strategy could be placed for the consideration of beneficiaries, who would ensure that donors would be responsible enough to meet in a more effective way donor concerns regarding resource allocation. His delegation shared the view that the delivery of technical assistance was the responsibility of                                                                                      WT/COMTD/M/30                                                                                              Page 9 donors, and beneficiaries were responsible to ensure that they benefitted from technical assistance in a useful way.","WTCOMTDM30.pdf","Philippines, Norway, Secretariat"
"2714",2714,"44","44.      The representative of the United States said that the Secretariat report called for the evaluation of WTO programmes on a geographic and thematic basis which made it possible to collect lessons applicable as widely as possible to activities across more than one country. He said that such information would be systematically disseminated to the Secretariat, beneficiary countries, and donors countries, and that therefore the United States supported the concept. He said that his delegation was happy to note that the proposal incorporated both external and internal evaluation. His delegation also had specific comments and questions concerning the report. First, he noted that the evaluation questionnaires did not ask participants what their objectives were, and said that it was important to collect information on, inter alia, the objectives of participants. He asked whether, in the process of planning the activity, there was a process for written agreement between the Secretariat and the beneficiary on the needs to which the assistance provided was designed to address, and the objectives of the assistance. His delegation believed that such a process was vital, not only to the delivery of the assistance, but also for the evaluation of its delivery and its effectiveness. He said that the process of reporting back to the CTD in a format that conveyed useful information was also important, and his delegation wished to hear the Secretariat's thinking in this regard. He also asked that if the information was stored in the technical assistance data-base, whether it would be possible for the Secretariat to report back to members on a more frequent basis.","WTCOMTDM30.pdf","United, States, Secretariat, WTO, Secretariat, United, States, Secretariat, CTD, Secretariat, Secretariat"
"2715",2715,"45","45.     The Director of the Technical Cooperation Division said that he was in full agreement with the representative of Norway that the implementation of monitoring and evaluation functions should be done on a gradual basis. He said that, given available resources, this was the only approach could be envisioned over the coming years, adding that it was a wise approach that would allow lessons to be drawn. Referring to the question from the Philippines, he said that the Strategy paper contained a section on evaluation and follow up. He said that as a result of suggestions made at the 29th Session of the CTD, the questionnaires had been revised to include a section on objectives. These revised questionnaires were to be annexed to the draft Strategy paper circulated in November. He said that the Technical Cooperation Division was prepared to make available on a more frequent basis information on activities undertaken, their costs and purposes. He said that discussions were underway with the Secretariat Working Group on LDCs so that the same database could be used, and discussions were underway with the Finance and General Services Division (FGSD), so that financial figures which appeared were the official figures of the FGSD.","WTCOMTDM30.pdf","Director, Technical, Cooperation, Division, Norway, Philippines, CTD, Technical, Cooperation, Division, Secretariat, Working, Group, on, LDCs, General, Services, Division"

The Chairman recalled that at the 29th Session of the CTD, he had mentioned the statement by the Director-General at the 3 May General Council meeting regarding provision of information on market access for exports originating in least-developed countries, and had indicated that he wished to take up an issue of procedure. Normally, notifications and information provided on changes to GSP were sent to the CTD under the provisions of the Enabling Clause and it was assumed, therefore, that information on any actions taken by Members under their GSP schemes in favour of LDCs would also be provided in this way. On the other hand, steps taken under the 1999 Waiver on Preferential Tariff WT/COMTD/M/30 Page 10 Treatment for LDCs were to be notified to the Council on Trade in Goods. The Chairman recalled that at the 29th Session, he had said that he would, with Members' permission, consult with the Chairman of the CTG on how to resolve this inconsistency, and then hold some informal consultations. However, because of the summer break it has not yet been possible for the Chairman to hold these consultations with the Chairperson of the Council for Trade in Goods. He hoped to be able to report back to the CTD at the next session. Advice was also to be sought from the WTO Legal Division on the matter.","WTCOMTDM30.pdf","Chairman, CTD, Director-General, GSP, CTD, Members, LDCs, Chairman, Members, Chairman, CTG, Chairman, Chairperson, Council, for, Trade, in, Goods, CTD, WTO, Legal, Division"

The representative of Bangladesh brought to the attention of the CTD the fact that the European Commission had recommended to its Member states that unrestricted market access be extended to all exports of LDCs, with the exclusion of arms. He said that the LDCs had been arguing in favour of such an initiative, and that therefore the EC's proposal was welcome. He proposed that the CTD take note of this initiative, and that it encourage that the proposal be finalised. He asked that the CTD call on other OECD Members, especially the United States, Canada and Japan, to take similar steps.","WTCOMTDM30.pdf","Bangladesh, CTD, European, Commission, Member, LDCs, EC, CTD, CTD, OECD, Members, United, States, Canada, Japan"

He said that the Commission had proposed that all remaining imports from LDCs which were not subject to unrestricted market access (excluding arms) be granted such access, with phase-in periods on sensitive products such as bananas, sugar and rice. The outcome of the debate among EU member-States was awaited. He recalled that the EC already absorbed 56 percent of LDC exports, which made it the largest importer of LDC products, and his delegation hoped that this announcement would inject more momentum to the discussion of such initiatives amongst other trading partners, and lead to improved market access conditions for LDCs.","WTCOMTDM30.pdf","Commission, EU, EC"
"2722",2722,"51","51.      The representative of Canada informed the CTD that as of 1 September 2000, Canada had increased the number of products that could enter duty-free from LDCs. She said Canada had eliminated duties on imports from LDCs on an additional 570 tariff lines, as a result of which LDC exporters were eligible for duty-free treatment on 90 per cent of all tariff lines, up from 82 per cent. She said that to further improve opportunities for LDC exporters, Canada had further liberalised the origin requirements that applied to imports from LDCs.","WTCOMTDM30.pdf","Canada, CTD, Canada, Canada, Canada"
"2723",2723,"52","52.      The representative of Uganda expressed the appreciation of his delegation to the EC for the proposal by the Commission on unrestricted market access for LDCs. His delegation also welcomed the statement made by Canada. He said he hoped these measures would facilitate diversification. He said that a discussion of how to take advantage of such increased access opportunities through capacity-building was important. He encouraged trading partners to continue providing increased access through preference schemes, without bringing in extraneous issues.","WTCOMTDM30.pdf","Uganda, EC, Commission, Canada"
"2724",2724,"53","53.      The representative of Zambia thanked the EC and Canada for the information they had communicated, and encouraged other trading partners to take similar steps in the near future. He recalled the Director-General's appeal to major trading partners to open their markets more fully to the exports of LDCs, and to provide more technical assistance. He said that such measures were a top priority. He said that in addition to tariff and non-tariff barriers, supply-side issues should also be an element of market access discussions. His delegation thought that an approach focused uniquely on market access without paying due attention to supply-side constraints was incomplete, as many constraints continued to impede exports. He said that the WTO needed to play a vital role in exploring export possibilities and opportunities for LDCs, and should encourage other relevant organisations to address their supply-side constraints.","WTCOMTDM30.pdf","Zambia, EC, Canada, Director-General, WTO"

"2727",2727,"56","56.      The Chairman recalled that, following a period of uncertainty, the General Council agreed on 17 July 2000 to reinvigorate the work programme on electronic commerce on a practical basis. This was understood to be without prejudice to any delegation's position on the status of the 1998 Declaration (WT/MIN(98)/DEC/2). Four subsidiary bodies, including the CTD, were invited to pick up their work on e-commerce within their respective spheres of competence, identify cross-sectoral issues, and report back to the General Council at its regular meeting in December 2000. He recalled, the work programme on e-commerce adopted in September 1998 had called on the CTD to ""examine and report on the development implications of electronic commerce, taking into account the economic, financial and development needs of developing countries"" (WT/L/274). Since then a number of delegations had made submissions and comments on the issue and the Secretariat issued a ""Note on the Development Dimension of E-commerce"" (WT/COMTD/W/51) and also organized a seminar on electronic commerce and development. (The report on the seminar is available in document WT/COMTD/18.) A final report on the contribution of the CTD to the work programme was presented to the General Council in July 1999 (WT/COMTD/19). He said that in the report of the CTD, a number of questions that might be further explored were listed. These included, for example: What were the infrastructure and human resources developments required to address the needs of developing countries in e-commerce? What kind of technical assistance could be provided by the WTO? What were some of the innovative solutions and success stories in developing countries that others could learn from? What impact was e-commerce likely to have on customs revenue in developing countries? How significant were the duties on particular products traded electronically in specific countries?","WTCOMTDM30.pdf","Chairman, General, Council, CTD, General, Council, CTD, Secretariat, CTD, General, Council, CTD, WTO"
"2728",2728,"57","57.      The Chairman drew the attention of Members to different possibilities regarding the organisation of the work of the CTD on electronic commerce for the rest of the year. He recalled that the General Council had asked the CTD to report at the December meeting of the General Council. At the same time, the CTD planned to have one more formal session, during which it would need to hold whatever discussions Members desired to have on the subject and finalise the report. Given this situation, he said Members might feel it necessary to have informal consultations, in order to facilitate the finalisation of the report presented to the General Council. The schedule of meetings was extremely crowded for the month of October, which created logistical problems for both Members and the Secretariat. However, he drew the attention of Members to the fact that during the Geneva Week for non-residents, a briefing session was planned on electronic commerce, for the afternoon of the 25th of October. Speakers at this session included WTO Secretariat staff as well as staff from the ITU, ITC, and UNCTAD. The Chairman proposed that the CTD could make use of this opportunity and enlarge this particular session of the Geneva Week into an informal CTD consultation on electronic commerce. This would have a number of benefits: it would enable the CTD to have informal consultations in a context where logistical difficulties may have hampered the organisation of such consultation; the CTD could draw on the planned presence of experts from other IGOs; and the CTD would also receive the input of non-residents into a component of the CTD's work programme, which was in keeping with the desire of the Membership to increase the effective participation of all members in the work of the WTO. The overall the goal of the informal consultations was to facilitate the finalisation of the CTD's report to the General Council.","WTCOMTDM30.pdf","Chairman, Members, CTD, General, Council, CTD, General, Council, CTD, Members, Members, General, Council, Members, Secretariat, Members, WTO, Secretariat, ITU, ITC, UNCTAD, Chairman, CTD, CTD, CTD, CTD, CTD, WTO, CTD, General, Council"
"2729",2729,"58","58.     The representative of the United States said that her delegation could support the suggestions made by the Chairman, and said that it would be very beneficial to hear from other institutions. She said that e-commerce had become a very significant feature on the development side. She said that with respect to the questions raised earlier on revenue, there was an unofficial Secretariat study which was undertaken in 1999 on revenue issues. She said that the Secretariat could assist interested WT/COMTD/M/30 Page 12 Members in identifying where they could locate the study. She said that, with reference to the ITC Executive Forum, the ITC web-site for the event identified several policy-related questions which Members were seized upon in the WTO. She suggested that if the work programme were to proceed in accordance with the General Council decision in December, that the CTD could consider holding a symposium with the participation of developing country entrepreneurs, to update information provided in the seminar on electronic commerce of 1999 organised by the CTD. She said that at the informal session, it would be useful to distribute information on the initiative launched at the G-8 Okinawa Summit, which aimed at building capacity in developing countries in order to level the playing field in e-commerce. The initiative brought together the G-8 countries in their commitment to build capacity for e-commerce in developing countries in a number of areas, including infrastructure and training. Furthermore, private sector companies had signed on to the initiative and announced their intention to work with developing country partners. She said that since the 1998 Declaration on E-Commerce had indicated the relevance of the impact of e-commerce on developing country financial and economic interests, and that there had been a lot done since 1998. Her delegation hoped that once direction had been given by the General Council, Members could address some of the initiatives on capacity-building, and that the CTD could benefit from case studies and examples that have resulted from various initiatives. She pointed to the United States initiative to connect Sub- Saharan African countries, which was a US$15 million initiative over a five-year term. The United States also had an ""Internet for Development"" initiative which included pilot countries, a list of which was increasing and which included Egypt, Uganda, Guatemala and various others. Her delegation would expand on these initiatives in the future. Her delegation was of the view that the G-8 initiative went beyond what most bilateral initiatives had to offer.","WTCOMTDM30.pdf","United, States, Chairman, Secretariat, Secretariat, Members, ITC, ITC, Members, WTO, General, Council, CTD, CTD, Okinawa, Summit, G-8, General, Council, Members, CTD, United, States, United, States, Egypt, Uganda, Guatemala"

His delegation could also support the proposal in favour of holding a symposium on electronic commerce. He said that in view of the increasing importance of electronic commerce, the development of electronic commerce presented great opportunities for all WTO Members, in particular developing countries, and all businesses, including small and medium-size enterprises. In this context, the examination of electronic commerce issues in the CTD should take place. His delegation was of the view that issues related to electronic- commerce included cross-cutting issues, in particular, issues relating to financial and economic development issues; and to technical cooperation and capacity-building issues. His delegation was firmly in support of setting up a horizontal task force with the participation of capital-based experts, as this was the most appropriate forum for addressing cross-cutting issues. His delegation requested that the Chairman's report should state that electronic commerce related issues should be further examined as expeditiously as possible, especially from the point of view development. His delegation also requested that the Chairman report to the General Council state that many Members supported the establishment of a horizontal task force.","WTCOMTDM30.pdf","Japan, General, Council, WTO, Members, CTD, Chairman, Chairman, General, Council, Members"

The representative of Pakistan agreed that, whatever was being done as part of the reinvigoration of the work programme, was without prejudice to the status of the 1998 Declaration. He said his delegation could go along with the basic parameters set out by the Chairman, and was willing to participate meaningfully in any work undertaken, as the outcome of work conducted in the CTD was of paramount importance in terms of the ultimate analysis of e-commerce and the work of the CTD covered areas of importance to developing countries such as technical and financial assistance and fiscal issues. His delegation had taken note of proposals for a symposium and was of the view that February was too early for organising such an event, as it would be better to await the outcome of work conducted in the CTD and the other three subsidiary bodies. Regarding fiscal issues, and more specifically the unofficial study undertaken by the Secretariat in 1999, his delegation was of the view that this study should be circulated to Members, perhaps in the form of a non-paper, so that it could become a basis for discussion. Finally, his delegation requested that advance notice be given of the holding of informal discussion, and requested the Secretariat to prepare a short synoptic note on the discussion of electronic commerce held in the CTD prior to July 1999.

He said that the interest of developing countries in the subject of electronic commerce was further made manifest by the fact that the forthcoming Heads of Government Meeting of the G-15 had as its theme Information Technology and Telecommunications, with development questions as a fundamental perspective, including those questions relating to human resources and the development of competitiveness, which were brought under the collective heading of ""e-development"".","WTCOMTDM30.pdf","Venezuela, Members, UNCTAD, Electronic, Commerce, Okinawa, United, States, Japan, Information, Technology, and, Telecommunications"

It appeared that Members were comfortable with the idea of joining forces with the Geneva Week to hold informal consultations, with a view to finalising the report during the last meeting of the CTD in October. He noted that there had been a number of requests for further information, and said that the Secretariat would look into this and provide information as appropriate.","WTCOMTDM30.pdf","Chairman, CTD, General, Council, Members, CTD, Secretariat"
"2737",2737,"65","65.     The Chairman recalled that at the 29th Session of the CTD, he had mentioned that the CTD may be required to contribute to the WTO input to the UN High Level Event on Financing for Development, to be held in 2001, but that this would depend on the outcome of the General Council to be held on 17 July. At that meeting of the General Council, Ambassador Bryn, the Chairman, recalled that on 19 May 2000, an informal meeting with Members of the UN Preparatory Committee for the High-Level Event on Financing for Development, Heads of Delegations of WTO Members and Senior Officials of the WTO Secretariat, had been held in order to hear from the Bureau of the UN Preparatory Committee proposals for a closer dialogue and cooperation with the WTO for the preparation of the High-Level Event scheduled for May 2001. Ambassador Bryn also mentioned that the Secretariat was already involved in two of the preparatory working groups, on trade and on systemic issues. Given the strong wish of the Preparatory Committee of the High-Level Event to receive a political input from the WTO membership, Ambassador Bryn proposed that the contact point for such an input be the CTD and that its Chairman be in contact with the Preparatory Committee. This proposal was accepted by the General Council. The Chairman recalled that it was also agreed that issues which might be raised in the context of the preparations for the High-Level Event would be discussed in the CTD. He recalled that a similar procedure had been followed in preparing a GATT contribution to the 1992 United Nations Conference on Environment and Development (UNCED) in Rio de Janeiro. That contribution was based on an input from the Secretariat and discussions among Members in the appropriate Committee, and it was agreed that the Chairman of the General Council would inform the Co-Chairs of the UN Preparatory Committee accordingly.

"2738",2738,"66","66.      The Chairman recalled that the UN had structured the preparatory process for the High Level Event through the establishment of six working groups: Systemic Issues; Domestic Financial Resources; FDI and other private flows; International Financial Cooperation, ODA and Debt; and Trade. The UN had also initiated a process of holding regional consultative meetings, the first one having been held in Jakarta in early August for the Asia-Pacific region. The objective was that the work of the working groups was to contribute to the final declaration to be adopted in May 2001 at the High Level Event. In the context of these preparations, the involvement of the WTO had to date followed two tracks. First, the WTO secretariat had been invited to take part in the work of the working group on systemic issues, on FDI and other private flows, and on trade. The working group on systemic issues had its first meeting on 25 July 2000 in Tarrytown, New York, and aimed to complete its work by November of this year. Regarding the working group on trade issues, the WTO Secretariat had been invited to make a written input in the form of an analytical paper. Secondly the Preparatory Committee had a strong wish that the WTO make a written input of a political nature. As this input was to be from the WTO's Membership, it was important that the matter be taken up to establish how the CTD shall proceed. The following possibilities suggested themselves: (i) that the CTD await the completion of the Secretariat paper, and hold a discussion on its content. The report would then be forwarded to the Preparatory Committee, with a covering letter in which the Chairman would summarise the views expressed by Members. (ii) Alternatively, that the CTD ask the Secretariat to make a compilation of points made by Members in discussions on the Secretariat paper, and on the question of Financing for Development in general, and attach this compilation to the Secretariat paper, and forward these to the Preparatory Committee.","WTCOMTDM30.pdf","Chairman, UN, Domestic, Financial, Resources, International, Financial, Cooperation, ODA, UN, Jakarta, Asia-Pacific, WTO, WTO, Tarrytown, New, York, WTO, Secretariat, Preparatory, Committee, WTO, WTO, CTD, CTD, Secretariat, Preparatory, Committee, Chairman, Members, CTD, Secretariat, Members, Secretariat, Secretariat, Preparatory, Committee"

Mr Ravier, in his introduction, pointed out that, although technical cooperation was enshrined in practically every WTO agreement, its positioning in respect to other WTO Secretariat activities was not always perfectly clear.

"2749",2749,"76","76.     Therefore, targeting of technical cooperation was important. Likewise, the instruments of technical cooperation needed to be targeted: both general and specialized instruments were necessary, as well as coordination with other international organizations to avoid overlapping and to make best use of scarce resources. In this connection, financial resources were not the only important aspect. The availability of human resources in the WTO Secretariat was also of utmost importance.","WTCOMTDM30.pdf","WTO, Secretariat"

A number of participants pointed out that, for developing countries, especially least- developed countries, the building-up of supply capacity was a key element in trade-related development. This was partly, but not wholly, the WTO's responsibility. The WTO's competence and expertise lay in improving knowledge of multilateral rules and working procedures, assisting in the definition of approaches to negotiations, and assisting in the implementation of commitments including the effective use of the DSU.       This was particularly relevant to poorer developing countries, including LDCs.","WTCOMTDM30.pdf","WTO, WTO"
"2752",2752,"79","79.      By contrast, it was noted that the relatively more developed and integrated developing countries had somewhat different needs, including a deeper understanding of WTO rules and disciplines; of detailed negotiating techniques in agriculture and services; and the creation of capabilities to address problems of implementation.

While Members' immediate needs in fulfilling obligations and taking advantage of trading opportunities could be a starting-point, a multi-year programme based on a logical sequencing of activities should be the main focus for the construction of a clear strategy. Follow-up action and assessment criteria should also be identified at the programming stage. Identification of priorities should be seen as a key component of programming and planning, but flexibility should be built in to deal with urgent, ad-hoc requests.","WTCOMTDM30.pdf","WTO, Members"
"2758",2758,"84","84.     The implementation of technical cooperation activities should continue to be mainly demand- driven. Needs assessments should thus be the starting point of the programming and planning of technical cooperation activities. These assessments should be carried out in a systematic manner, but they should not be too rigid nor too time-consuming to prepare by countries.","WTCOMTDM30.pdf",""
"2759",2759,"85","85.     Three levels of coordination of technical cooperation activities were identified: within the Secretariat, at the national level, and with other international and regional organizations. In this connection, the view was expressed that WTO technical cooperation should be limited to what the organization can do best. It was observed by the Secretariat that programming of technical cooperation activities was extremely difficult when only 40 per cent of developing countries                                                                                    WT/COMTD/M/30                                                                                           Page 17 responded to the WTO questionnaire on their needs for technical assistance for the forthcoming year and when 90 percent of activities were financed through voluntary contributions.","WTCOMTDM30.pdf","Secretariat, WTO, Secretariat, WTO"

With regard to technical cooperation in general, five ""disconnects"" were identified: ownership (with different ministries in Members being responsible for finance, trade and development); transparency of dissemination of information at the national level; information sharing on training taking place in different ministries of countries; information on what other international organizations do at regional and other levels; and the need for adequately trained human resources to undertake negotiations.

"2762",2762,"88","88.      In developing the WTO's strategy for technical cooperation delivery, consideration should be given to ways in which information could be more effectively disseminated. Innovative techniques that might be used could include more effective use of established reference centres; distance learning; technical assistance linked to trade policy reviews; training of trainers; and outsourcing to regional institutions. However, some developing Members noted that they lacked technical capacity for distance learning and that there was no substitute for direct contact with expertise from the WTO.

This would mean ensuring that:         -       monitoring by WTO staff was continuous. WTO staff should be clear from the outset                 what needs were to be addressed in a technical cooperation programme, what were                 the objectives of the programme, and which indicators were best suited to judge the                 results of the programme.         -       evaluation at the project or programme level was built in from the outset and was part                 of the programme outline (criteria, deadline, internal or external evaluation);         -       an internal assessment was done for each technical assistance project (independently                 from a more specific CTD-evaluation mandate);         -       the main elements of evaluations were collected in a computerized database;         -       follow-up was automatically envisaged when planning and executing technical                 cooperation activities;         -       lessons learned were fed back into the planning and programming of technical                 assistance programmes; and that WT/COMTD/M/30 Page 18         -       experiences drawn from monitoring and evaluation at the project-level by WTO staff                 were reflected adequately in the annual reports to the CTD on technical cooperation.

The interplay between the LDCs, donors and agencies in the formulation of projects and the delivery of assistance was also mentioned. In this regard, the potential rôle of the IF as a mechanism for coordination was stressed; some supported the need to set up a Trust Fund to support its operation.

Mr Stoler, introducing the topic, emphasised the serious human and financial resource constraints faced by the Secretariat in the area of technical cooperation, as well as the need to bring the financing of technical cooperation on budget. This would bring greater predictability and consistency to the WTO technical cooperation programme, and enable it to respond positively to requests for assistance. Furthermore, it would have the effect of spreading the financial burden in a more equitable manner and providing adequate resources both for training and for technical                                                                                    WT/COMTD/M/30                                                                                           Page 19 cooperation. It was recalled that for the WTO 2001 budget exercise, the proposal had been made to increase the technical cooperation budget to 10 million Swiss Francs, of which about 75 per cent was activity-related and 25 per cent human resource-related (new staff posts). On training, a separate proposal intended to double the capacity of the Secretariat to provide Trade Policy Courses had been drafted.","WTCOMTDM30.pdf","Stoler, Secretariat, WTO, WTO, Secretariat, Trade, Policy, Courses"
"2773",2773,"98","98.      Mr Stoler observed that although technical cooperation was a demand-driven activity, a certain distillation of requests received from developing countries for the year 2000 needed to be carried out to determine what could reasonably be expected in the light of resource constraints. For this purpose, a number of criteria and priorities needed to be established; (i) activities which were similar, both by country and by issue, to what had already been done in 1999 should be eliminated where possible; ii) requests for which there was little or no further information should be discounted; iii) requests which were duplicative, or that could be folded into other activities, should be combined; iv) if national priorities could be addressed in the framework of regional activities, this should be done; v) requests where host governments could probably provide the financing or at least cost- sharing should be identified; and vi) where the number of WTO officials engaged in an activity could be reduced, this should be done. Priority should be given to activities with LDCs; activities to assist most recent Members and countries and territories in the process of accession; and issues related to immediate implementation and current negotiations in agriculture and services.","WTCOMTDM30.pdf","Stoler, WTO, Members"

It was emphasised that clear planning, prioritisation and vision were necessary for the effective allocation of resources. The Secretariat should not act simply on the basis of demands but should filter demands through prioritisation, planning and full consultation with Members concerning the mix of activities and budgetary constraints. It was stated that even if technical cooperation activities were funded on-budget, there would still be a balance to be found between budgetary and extra-budgetary funds.","WTCOMTDM30.pdf","Stoler, Secretariat, Members"

This was due in part to the fact that efforts had been taken to ensure that all concerned divisions in the house had checked the document to ensure it was as complete as possible. The pressure of work leading up to Geneva Week had also been a factor. The document was an update of previous work undertaken in the CTD (notably documents WT/COMTD/W/35 and WT/COMTD/W/66) and was pursuant to a request made by Members at the 29th Session of the CTD. He said the objective was to provide an overview of the implementation of the special and differential treatment provisions in the various WTO agreements and decisions. He said that in preparing the document, it had been possible to draw on the substantive information available and discussions held in the various WTO committees. The document also sought to examine to what extent it was possible to measure, either qualitatively or quantitatively, the implementation of various types of special and differential treatment. There were a number of instances where it was possible to measure the implementation of WTO agreements, and part of the information on this came through notifications, such as, for instance, under the Agreement on Agriculture, or information on technical assistance provided by Members. The paper had used a six-fold typology of special and differential treatment provisions, which had been first used for the 1999 High-Level Symposium on Trade and Development. The six types of special and differential treatment were specified in the document. Each of the sections in the paper which dealt with a particular agreement began with general comments, and then proceed to provide information on the special and differential treatment by type of provision found in the agreement in question. Information was presented in the form of a table, with one column giving the provision, and a second column, entitled ""Comment"" which showed how the different types of special and differential treatment provision had been used and also contained references to the sources of information. He said that section C of the paper contained a table which showed the number of special and differential treatment provisions by agreement and by type of special and differential treatment provisions.","WTCOMTDM31.pdf","Director, Development, Division, Geneva, Week, CTD, Members, CTD, WTO, WTO, WTO, Members"

As such, her delegation hoped that the CTD would carry over its discussion on the paper to future meetings of the CTD.

For example, there were numerous statements criticising the GSP programmes, but there was no discussion of their benefits. Was one to assume that there were no benefits? Nor was there any data presented on the use of GSP programmes, nor on South-South trade between developing countries. There had been some comments made earlier on the discussion on market access for least-developed countries which were thought-provoking and possibly overlapped with some of the points made under this rubric. She said that the paper should also be modified to take into account the benefits developing countries were already receiving through technical assistance. In redrafting the document, the Secretariat could also take into account information on the participation of developing countries in international trade that was already being developed. She said that in regard to certain cases where there was connection between special and differential treatment provisions and technical assistance, there was already a major debate on technical assistance throughout the WTO.

In relation to the GSP, which had been in existence prior to the WTO, she asked whether the Secretariat was in a position to provide some sort of comparative study. Her delegation, along with others, was of the view that some of the benefits of the GSP had been eroded through trade liberalisation and after the WTO agreements had come into force. She did not know how such an exercise would fit into the discussion of special and differential treatment, but it was important to examine whether there had been an enhancement of benefits under the GSP, or whether these had been eroded.","WTCOMTDM31.pdf","Sri, Lanka, CTD, Members, WTO, United, States, GSP, WTO, Secretariat, GSP, WTO, GSP"

He said that the approach taken by the Secretariat was commendable since it identified the broad lines of special and differential treatment. He said that further time was needed to reflect on the document, though of course delegations such as his were reflecting on the subject of special and differential treatment all the time. He said his delegation remained to be impressed by some of the points identified in the document, such as: provisions aimed at increasing the trade opportunities of developing countries; provisions under which WTO Members would safeguard the interests of WTO developing country Members; flexibility of commitments, of action, and use of policy instruments; transition time periods; technical assistance; and provision relating to least-developed countries.

He said there clearly was a ""moving target"" aspect to the issue, and that a number of requests and suggestions had been made. There had been requests to present the up-side and down-side of aspects of special and differential treatment, and in that respect the Secretariat was in the hands of the Membership. The document reflected what had factually become known, and comments made, in various committees, which perhaps explained why the document recorded certain views and not others. He noted that there had been requests for information on GSP programmes, and it remained to be seen in what context this could be done. One possibility was to look at the use of GSP in the context of the paper on the participation on international trade, and it was not clear to what extent information on preferences was currently available or reflected the current situation. In terms of updating WT/COMTD/W/77, he said that a discussion of a Secretariat working paper on special and differential treatment had been incorporated in the draft work programme for 2001, for the autumn 2001 meeting of the CTD, so there was scope for at least one update.","WTCOMTDM31.pdf","Director, Development, Division, Secretariat, GSP, GSP, Secretariat, CTD"

He said that a newsletter was available on the UNCTAD web-site which reported changes to GSP schemes made by preference donors. In the course of 2001, the UNCTAD would be undertaking a number of studies evaluating the impact of GSP schemes on preference-receiving countries. He recalled that at the CTD Seminar on Special and Differential Treatment held in March 2000, the UNCTAD had made a short presentation on the GSP and on the impact of these schemes on preference recipients.

The purpose of the seminar was to allow a frank exchange of views on the issue and to provide an input into the Committee's consideration of the question. (The seminar was also considered to be part of the ""Geneva Week"" for non-resident Members and Observers of the WTO.)       The seminar addressed two basic questions: the nature of the problems facing small economies and the possible solutions to those problems.          There was a broad measure of agreement that pursuing the question of definition was of limited value, but some participants felt that self-definition would be appropriate.                The methodological and other difficulties surrounding the computing of indices of vulnerability was also noted. It was widely agreed that it was more important to focus on the problems and possible solutions. As to the sources of vulnerability, small economies were characterised by a number of factors, some of which were inter-related. These include: (i) the limited size of their domestic market, reducing the scope for exploitation of economies of scale; (ii) the limited diversification of their export structure, both in relation to the range of products and concentration on a few markets; (iii) vulnerability to external and exogenous shocks, including natural disasters, and a limited adjustment capacity to these shocks; (iv) remoteness from markets and transport costs; (v) limited human resources and other factor endowments; (vi) shortfalls in institutional and administrative capacity.         While openness to trade may sometimes exacerbate vulnerability, such openness also afforded the opportunity to develop global industries, beyond the limited local market, and could also be a motor for growth and development.          There was broad agreement that internal reforms and policy measures were critical in addressing the problems of the small economies and in determining their participation in international trade and the global economy. Such reforms and measures included sound macroeconomic management. At a microeconomic level, it was important that small economies take advantage of technological developments, and that they target production to areas of comparative advantage, including those where economies of scale were not a fundamental determinant of competitiveness. E-commerce, tourism, financial services were cited as examples. Diversification of production and trade, while desirable, was difficult to achieve as it often required a significant amount of investment and training, and larger economies often seemed more attractive to foreign investors because of the size of their home markets. Flexible labour market policies, domestically and regionally, could also be important, alongside other measures, to address supply side bottlenecks.         However, there was broad support for the view that internal reforms and policy measures needed to be complemented by international endeavours. For example, the exports of the small economies often faced high tariff rates and non-tariff barriers in foreign markets. There was a need for enhanced, secure and predictable market access for exports of interest to small and vulnerable economies. WT/COMTD/M/31 Page 28          Participants felt that regional cooperation among small economies could help them overcome certain difficulties through the pooling together of their resources, including in international trade negotiations, at the bilateral, regional and multilateral levels. However, there was also a view that regional organizations could not fully represent all the interests of member states. The possibility of establishing regional trade agreements to expand market opportunities and to allow for a wider production base was supported by a number of participants, but others pointed out that, even working together, their combined size was still much less than other countries.         In relation to multilateral rules, participants suggested that an issue-by-issue approach might be taken in assessing how to respond to the constraints faced by small economies. Among the possible mechanisms that might be used were asymmetrical transition periods, flexibility provisions and adjustment mechanisms, none of which were new to the WTO.         A number of participants felt that the difficulties in terms of financial and human resources faced by small economies in making use of the Dispute Settlement Mechanism needed to be addressed as a matter of priority, through the provision of appropriate technical and financial assistance.          Representatives of small economies highlighted the great difficulties they confronted in fully participating in the work of the WTO. Some did not have the resources to maintain a mission in Geneva, but capacity constraints in capitals were also a problem. It was therefore necessary to establish mechanisms through which participation and representation could be enhanced. In this context participants also emphasised the need for adequate technical assistance, and in this respect the importance of funding the delivery of WTO technical cooperation on a secure and predictable basis.          During the seminar, it was mentioned that there were a number of regional initiatives being undertaken at present to strengthen the participation of the small economies in the WTO, for example, through the establishment of regional representation by the Pacific Forum countries and EC support for ACP representation. It was noted that there were communities of interests between small economies, LDCs and larger developing countries on many trade issues – such as greater market access or contingent trade remedies – that could be explored and built upon in the context of multilateral negotiations and through greater networking. On the other hand, there was also a view that there were limits to regional cooperation, and nothing could fully substitute for representation in Geneva.          Some participants called for the establishment of a work programme to look at the specific problems and needs of small and vulnerable economies. In the first stage, this might take the form of analysis of the trade of small economies, the extent to which they had benefited from provisions for special and differential treatment and the main obstacles to the provision of such treatment. A second stage might attempt to establish prescriptions to overcome these problems and the means for their implementation. One participant suggested that such work could be undertaken jointly by the WTO Secretariat with the collaboration of other agencies, as appropriate.          Finally, addressing the problems of small economies clearly requires a comprehensive and coherent approach that extends beyond the trade field. In particular, integrated initiatives are required to address the supply side bottlenecks that constrain the participation of small economies in the global economy. In this respect, a number of international organizations present during the seminar outlined their technical assistance and capacity building programmes which could be of special interest to small and vulnerable economies, and two developed Members gave an indication of programmes that could also be of assistance.                                               __________","WTCOMTDM31.pdf","Chairman, CTD, Chairman, Committee, WTO, Committee, on, Trade, and, Development, Committee, Members, WTO, WTO, WTO, Geneva, WTO, WTO, Pacific, EC, ACP, LDCs, Geneva, WTO, Secretariat, Members"

A report on the seminar prepared under the Chairman's own authority had been circulated to Members (see Annex). The Chairman said that there had been some very interesting presentations by experts from other international organizations and by academics. The CTD was also privileged to hear from a number of the representatives of small economies who were here for Geneva Week, as well as representatives from the Geneva community of Members. The seminar cast light on the problems of small economies, looking at their development indicators, including the issue of measuring vulnerability. It looked at the constraints on the small economies in trying to develop and diversify their trade, and in trying to negotiate on a number of fronts simultaneously. It also posed questions as to how the small economies could cope better, including through regional cooperation. Finally, it examined how the WTO and other institutions might respond. The seminar showed that there were some very real problems facing the small economies. Some of the solutions were in their own hands, but it was also the view that the international community could contribute to the solution of their problems. There was also a specific proposal for further work on the issue in the WTO.

The documentation provided was also useful, and was a source for reference for the future. She said that the seminar clearly demonstrated that while small economies shared some problems with other developing economies, they also faced peculiar problems which arose from the very fact of being small economies. She said that the solution called for some measure of differential treatment, possibly on an issue-by-issue basis, for resolving the problems of small economies and to ensure that they had a greater level of participation in the world trading system. She said that some of the other points raised included: cooperation at a regional level, which was something that Caribbean countries had been pursuing assiduously, the need for a higher degree of technical assistance from the WTO Secretariat, and other types of assistance which went beyond the scope of the WTO.","WTCOMTDM31.pdf","Trinidad, and, Tobago, Caribbean, WTO, Secretariat, WTO"
"2854",2854,"27","27.      The representative of Barbados said that the seminar had covered a range of issues of importance to small economies. Her delegation found that the range of issues, which included characteristics, constraints, vulnerabilities, and policy approaches – domestic and international - made for a discussion that led to a deeper and further understanding of issues related to small economies. She said that many participants had stated that in the trade-related field, there were several measures and mechanisms that could address the problems, constraints and needs of small economies. Her delegation held the view that the case had been amply made for the launching of a work programme on small economies. Such a programme could serve an exploratory function which could allow all Members to examine issues closely, as well as an opportunity to formulate prescriptions as to the way forward, in order to address the needs and constraints of small economies. Her delegations joined other in calling upon the Secretariat to set in place a work progamme on small economies. She said that she acknowledged that the report was on the Chairman's own responsibility, but was struck by the reference to the need to resolve civil conflicts. Her delegation held the view that the focus of work in the WTO should remain on trade issues. Finally, regarding the fora in which work on small economies could be taken up, she said that while the UNCTAD played a very important complementary role to the WTO, there was a need for substantive work on multilateral rules to be undertaken in the WTO, adding that the WTO would be one of the last organisations to address the issue of small economies.","WTCOMTDM31.pdf","Barbados, Members, Secretariat, Chairman, WTO, UNCTAD, WTO, WTO, WTO"
"2855",2855,"28","28.      The representative of Bolivia expressed the concern of his delegation regarding the format and the proceedings of the seminar on small economies. He said that the objective had been to discuss the interests of Members who had small economies, and to seek solutions to problems faced by these countries, within the multilateral trading system. He said that there had been confusion arising from the fact that the theme of small economies had been presented as a question of small states. He also drew attention to the fact that the date of the seminar had been changed, and that it had been held on a Saturday. His delegation was of the view that the seminar had not reached its desired objectives, had generated confusion and had frustrated the expectations of Members interested in the question. His delegation hoped that future activities on the question of small economies would be organised in consultation with small economies, and was ready to support any initiative in favour of small economies.","WTCOMTDM31.pdf","Bolivia, Members, Members"
"2856",2856,"29","29.      The representative of Guatemala said that the theme of small economies was an important one, adding that the WTO was lagging in its work on the question when compared to other international organisations and regional fora. His delegation was of the view that the seminar would be helpful in bringing solutions to a number of difficulties which confronted small economies. His delegation was concerned about two matters: first, the change of date to a Saturday. His delegation had believed that the practice of holding seminars on weekdays would have been continued, and the                                                                                    WT/COMTD/M/31                                                                                            Page 5 change of date to a Saturday had a significant impact, given that this deterred a number of delegations from taking part, which was reflected in the attendance. Secondly, his delegation was of the view that the seminar had generated some confusion, rather than clarity, regarding the concept of small economies, given that a substantial part of the discussion had revolved around the definition of small states. While small states and small economies shared many characteristics, the two concepts were distinct. His delegation supported future work on small economies in the WTO, including through the elaboration of a work programme. His delegation supported the views expressed by Barbados regarding the inclusion of UNCTAD in work on small economies. He was of the opinion that, while the UNCTAD had indeed carried out much work on small economies, it was necessary to keep the work of both organisations distinct.","WTCOMTDM31.pdf","Guatemala, WTO, WTO, Barbados, UNCTAD, UNCTAD"

"2858",2858,"30","30.      The representative of the United States said her delegation benefitted from the seminar on small economies, and was impressed by the range of views expressed. She said that while there might have been a low turn out from developed countries, there were a very large number of developing countries present, especially in view of the presence of non-resident WTO members. She said that her delegation noted that there had been a lack of clarity on what constituted a small economy: there had been a number of references to small and vulnerable economies; to small, vulnerable and volatile economies; and to small, vulnerable and isolated economies. From the point of view of their advocates, each of these concepts presented serious issues for consideration, as these concepts expressed the particular nature of their economies' problems. While the United States had serious concerns about the lack of definitional clarity, there were a number of presentations made which suggested that countries considering themselves to be small economies could organise themselves in a way to identify and target arguments or views under the rubric of special and differential treatment in the context of existing WTO agreements. If this were to happen, it would better enable developed countries to target their special and differential treatment responses. She said that the United States could not, however, support a category in the WTO, especially in the light of the confusion expressed by some Members considering themselves to be small economies. She said that the WTO already recognised the needs of least-developed countries – most of which were in Africa – and the needs of developing countries. She recalled the point made by some participants at the seminar that the least-developed countries belonged to a defined category while developing countries considered themselves to be developing countries on the basis of self-definition, and said that while some developing countries were self-selecting, it did not follow that developed countries viewed such countries as developing countries in the context of WTO rules and benefits. The United States could not, at this time, endorse a Work Programme on small economies, but welcomed the interventions of countries considering themselves to be small economies, in order to allow Members to understand more clearly what was being targeted in the WTO. Her delegation reiterated that much of the discussion in the seminar was very substantive, and clearly noted the direction of countries to articulate and concretise particular problems so that they might be understood in the context of the special and differential treatment exercise and the work of the CTD. Referring to the Chairman's statement, she said that one thing that appeared to be missing were statements made by participants to the effect that trade was not the cause of vulnerability, but rather that financial flows were more of a problem. The inclusion of such a statement would have presented a more balanced picture. She referred to the sentence in the report which began ""while openness to trade may exacerbate vulnerability…"", which as it stood gave the impression that there was no comment made that trade did not cause vulnerability. She said that in making this point, her delegation still recognised that there clearly were issues of vulnerability and serious problems to be dealt with in trade matters.","WTCOMTDM31.pdf","United, States, WTO, United, States, WTO, United, States, WTO, Members, WTO, Africa, WTO, United, States, Members, WTO, CTD, Chairman"

The Chairman, responding to the comments made by the United States, recalled that the speaker from the World Bank had indicated that the study he refered to was still in process, and hence that the statement on trade not being a cause of vulnerability lacked an element of definiteness.","WTCOMTDM31.pdf","Chairman, United, States, World, Bank"

The representative of Mauritius said that the seminar had the merit of being successful, and had the enhanced benefit of participation from developed countries and international organisations. WT/COMTD/M/31 Page 6 His delegation was of the view that the Chairman's report considered a number of useful topics for reflection. He said that by highlighting matters of priority, the report set the parameters for future work. Responding to the comments made by the United States, he said that he shared the view that trade was not a cause of vulnerability, and added that the true concern remained the impact of vulnerability on participation in international trade. He said this concern should be taken into account in any future work. He highlighted the importance of macroeconomic management. He also requested that future work should take into account questions such as: How was it possible to take advantage of technological developments? How was it possible to take care of those determinants that were not so fundamental to competitiveness? How was it possible to harness electronic commerce, financial services, and tourism for the benefits of small economies? How could international endeavours could bring comfort in further helping small economies? How could small economies pool together their resources and take advantage of cooperation? He said that the report had given the right tone, and that there were indeed parameters for a broad agenda. He said that the approach taken should be a holistic one, tying in trade with other dimensions. How, for example, could technical assistance and capacity building programmes be articulated and implemented to meet the needs of small economies? He concluded by saying that his delegation's approach was on an issue-by-issue basis.","WTCOMTDM31.pdf","Mauritius, Chairman, United, States"
"2861",2861,"33","33.     The representative of the European Communities said that the holding of the seminar showed that the WTO was responsive to the concerns of its Members. His delegation was pleased that regional cooperation was a major topic that had come through in the seminar. Regional trade agreements and the pooling of resources in the regions could be a major help, and that there was value in cooperation with larger trading partners. Second, his delegation recognised that there was a problem in participating in Geneva-based work, and added that this was a generic problem that went beyond the question of small economies. Third, regarding the specific contribution the WTO could make to the discussion on small economies, his delegation noted the mention made in the Chairman's report of stable and predictable market access and of an issue-by-issue approach to specific problems and constraints. There was a problem if there was no definition of small economies, since if market access was to be granted, it was necessary to know to whom. Similarly, in order to pursue an issue by issue approach, some ground-work needed to be done in order to define which countries concerned. Self-selection was not the answer, given that both rules and benefits derived from them were under consideration, and it was necessary that the benefits be fully understood by those who provided them and took advantage of them.","WTCOMTDM31.pdf","European, Communities, WTO, Members, WTO, Chairman"

The representative of Chile said that his delegation shared the view of the representative of Bolivia who had alluded to the confusion which had been created during the seminar as the discussion switched between the question of small economies and small states. He said that at various points in the discussion, Chile could consider itself as falling within the small economies group, and at other times outside. He said that his delegation had a fundamental concern about the emergence of new groups the composition of which was not clearly established. He said that his delegation favoured an approach which identified problems common to developing countries, and which examined common solutions.","WTCOMTDM31.pdf","Chile, Bolivia, Chile"
"2864",2864,"36","36.     The representative of Egypt said his delegation shared many of the points in the Chairman's report concerning the need for adequate technical assistance, the need for adequate technical assistance, the importance of regional integration and cooperation, and the need to take advantage of technology developments. He said that formulating and agreeing to definitions was of value, and this was reinforced by the statements made by Bolivia and Guatemala. He said that some of the elements                                                                                    WT/COMTD/M/31                                                                                            Page 7 reflected in the Chairman's summary required the construction of a definition.

"2866",2866,"38","38.      The representative of Saint Lucia said that the seminar had been well attended, despite it being held on a Saturday. He said the Chairman's report was useful, though there were some areas that could be augmented. He recalled, and agreed with, a statement that had been made that the understanding of problems and difficulties constraining development was an evolving science. He said that in the 1950's, all countries had been treated similarly. Subsequently, there had arisen an appreciation that there was a distinction to be made between developed and developing countries. Still more recently, a differentiation had been made between developing countries and least-developed countries. There was still a need to examine whether there were any further disadvantages faced by countries. What had come out of the seminar was that there was clearly a perception that countries which had been identified because of their peculiar and unique disadvantages had not been able to benefit from globalisation and new market opportunities. He said that the issue was not one of defining a special category for these countries. Rather, what needed to be done, since there was a recognition that there could be particular problems facing those countries, was to address the issues that arose. If there could be any practical outcome from the Seminar, it would be the undertaking of a rigorous and authoritative analysis of problems facing these countries. While it was true that UNCTAD was carrying out work in this area, it was also necessary for the WTO to decide as to whether it was going to simply tag on to the UNCTAD's work, or undertake it own work. His delegation was of the view that it was more appropriate, given the very specific mandate of the WTO, that such work be undertaken by the WTO.","WTCOMTDM31.pdf","Saint, Lucia, Chairman, UNCTAD, WTO, UNCTAD, WTO, WTO"
"2867",2867,"39","39.      The representative of Cuba said the seminar had been a contribution to the understanding of the problems faced by small economies. He said that the participation of non-residents had been a positive feature. His delegation supported the proposal by the delegation of Barbados concerning the elaboration of a work programme on small economies. He said that as far as his delegation was concerned, there was no confusion, as it was clear that there were small economies in the WTO, and that there was a need for special and differential treatment in favour of these economies in order to strengthen their participation in international trade. He said it was not possible to have the same type of rules for all economies, and added that the list of factors cited by the Chairman in his report contributed to the identification of small economies. He said that in addition to these factors, it was necessary to take into account the fact that a number of economies were subjected to blockades or embargoes, which were unjustified and which caused a degree of vulnerability which beyond those faced by other economies. He said that Cuba was an example of a country which suffered from such vulnerability. He said in addition that the majority of various proposals made on implementation would lead to a better integration of small economies into the world trading system, and hence that swift decisions needed to be taken with respect to paragraphs 21 and 22 of the draft Seattle Ministerial text.","WTCOMTDM31.pdf","Cuba, Barbados, WTO, Chairman, Cuba, Seattle"

He said that a specific proposal had been made on the establishment of a work programme. He said that while there was as yet no agreement on the establishment of a work programme, there was however, widespread agreement that work should continue, and the precise nature of such work would need to be the subject of consultations.

The Chairman recalled that, following a period of uncertainty, the General Council had agreed on 17 July 2000 to reinvigorate the work programme on electronic commerce on a practical basis. This was understood to be without prejudice to any delegation's position on the status of the 1998 Declaration (WT/MIN(98)/DEC/2). The CTD was among four subsidiary bodies invited to pick up their work on e-commerce within their respective spheres of competence, identify cross-sectoral issues, and report back to the General Council at its regular meeting in December 2000. At its 30th Session, the CTD agreed to organize an informal meeting of the CTD jointly with Geneva Week to obtain briefings from various agencies to help formulate the CTD's report to the General Council. During this informal meeting, representatives of UNCTAD, ITC, ITU, and WIPO made presentations on their work on electronic commerce, and the CTD also heard from Secretariat staff on WTO's work in this field. There had been some limited time to discuss some concerns and questions raised by Members.","WTCOMTDM31.pdf","Chairman, General, Council, CTD, General, Council, CTD, CTD, Geneva, Week, CTD, General, Council, UNCTAD, ITC, ITU, WIPO, CTD, Secretariat, WTO, Members"
"2875",2875,"46","46.     The Chairman underlined a few points which seemed to emerge from the meeting:         •       Given the evolving nature of electronic commerce, policymakers as well as                 businesses were continuously confronted with new challenges as well as                 opportunities;         •       E-commerce could contribute to the greater and more effective participation of                 developing countries in world trade. There had been a few success stories in this                 regard. However, as one speaker pointed out, only 2 per cent of the world population                 was currently on-line. Many developing countries had capacity constraints which                 prevented them from participating actively in electronic commerce.         •       A number of international organizations were providing technical assistance towards                 enhancing the participation of developing countries in electronic commerce and were                 addressing legal and regulatory issues arising from the spread of electronic                 commerce. It was crucial that their efforts worked in the same direction and were                 better coordinated.

"2876",2876,"47","47.     The Chairman said the briefings had been very useful, but it seemed that the CTD might consider going into the matter in more depth. Based on the discussions during the last two meetings of the CTD, the Chairman had circulated a draft report for the General Council, for consideration by the CTD. The Chairman said he would, pending agreement by Members, submit the report to the General Council, on his own responsibility, for the December meeting.","WTCOMTDM31.pdf","Chairman, CTD, CTD, Chairman, General, Council, CTD, Chairman, Members, General, Council"
"2877",2877,"48","48.      The representative of the United States said that, the wording of paragraph 2 needed to read, ""without prejudice to any decision that may be taken by the General Council relating to the work programme on electronic commerce, including its structure"", as it was the understanding of her delegation that the structure of the work programme was not the only issue to be taken up by the General Council at its December meeting. She recalled that in discussions in the CTD, her delegation had stated on a number of occasions that electronic commerce was a tool for development, and not simply an area of which developed countries had taken advantage and where they had made advances. She said the United States had, once the WTO had agreed to the 1998 Declaration which included reference to the specific financial and economic needs of developing countries, initiated, in addition to the Africa project on electronic commerce, a specialised pilot project which covered countries from all areas of the world. She said that electronic commerce had in the United States been an engine for the growth and development of small and medium-scale enterprises, by helping them play on a level playing field with larger enterprises. She said that e-commerce would be of benefit to countries considering themselves to be small economies, as well as larger developing economies which needed to compete with one another as well as developed economies. She said that cooperation between firms in developed and developing countries led to a win-win situation, where developed country companies had access to additional markets and developing countries gained access to markets previously unexploited. She pointed to examples mentioned in other fora which showed that developing countries could market traditional products over the Internet; to research by the UNCTAD that had illustrated some of the markets in which developing countries could participate; and to the example of India which was a leader in the export of software products and whose success could be emulated by smaller economies. She said that the United States had enhanced the pilot project, and was working on joint bilateral projects. The United States recognised that capacity-building was a critical area for developing countries in relation to e-commerce. She said that electronic commerce created a better environment for access to technology. She also recalled that a number of developed countries announced in Okinawa, Japan a major initiative which was geared to capacity-building, and which introduced ""DOT Force"", that is the Digital Opportunity Task-Force aimed at addressing the ""digital divide"". She said she had referred to these different initiatives as they were complementary to the exercise being undertaken in the WTO, which was distinctly related to trade liberalisation and the avoidance of measures that would impede the growth of e-commerce and the advantages to be derived by developing countries. Her delegation had stated in other bodies that it was clear that WTO rules did apply in the area of electronic commerce. What was being engaged in was clarification on how such rules helped foster electronic commerce for developed and developing country Members of the WTO. Her delegation endorsed the elements highlighted by the Chairman in the draft report, adding that further consideration could be given to the elements of the seminar on electronic commerce to be held in 2001. She recalled that the CTD had held a seminar in 1999 which had been of value to large degree because of the participation of developing country entrepreneurs, including from Africa. She said that it had been encouraging to hear of developments from such participants. It was therefore useful to see what could be done through the CTD and its proposals to the General Council, and through the work of other international organisations. Her delegation had seen a circular from the Director-General that a symposium was to be held on 31 October on the results of the ITC Executive Forum, which had been a very hands-on and practical exercise. She said that it was her understanding that participants from the private sector were also to take part.

"2880",2880,"50","50.      The representative of Japan said his delegation had found the informal session held on 25 October had been informative. He noted that many delegations had stated that developmental issues raised in connection with e-commerce had wider implications. His delegation was therefore convinced that the realisation of ""e-equality"" required serious examinations in a horizontal manner. His delegation was of the view that electronic commerce had become an engine of economic growth and the expansion of trade, and emphasised the importance of the role of the private sector and the avoidance of unnecessary government restrictions or regulations. Turning to the draft report by the Chairman, the representative of Japan recalled that the CTD had identified in document WT/COMTD/19 an illustrative list of points for further study on a horizontal basis. According to that document, points included: Would unrestricted, unregulated electronic commerce provide increased market access for enterprises in developing countries? How would supply and demand for particular goods and services be affected by electronic commerce on a disaggregated level? What were the substitution effects of e-commerce in trade? What effects would e-commerce have on competition in different sectors? What would be the impact of e-commerce on domestic producers in specific sectors? What were the effects of inter-firm relations in e-commerce? How would e-commerce affect Members' obligations and commitments in the WTO Agreements? Therefore, in the CTD's report to the General Council in December 2001, and in the context of the General Council's request that the subsidiary bodies identify cross-sectoral issues, Japan proposed that the Chairman make the following points in his report: first, after paragraph 4 of the draft report, he said a statement needed to be made to the effect that the CTD had identified an illustrative list of questions warranting further study on a horizontal basis. Second, that at the 30th and 31st Sessions of the CTD Members had raised as issues the participation of developing country Members in electronic commerce; how to deal with the ""digital divide""; classification issues; and the simplification of trade procedures through electronic means. There was broad support for the view that such issues be explored through an ad hoc task force and within a reasonable time-frame. Commenting on paragraph 3 , his delegation thought that paragraph 3 was correct, but should be modified to read ""development aspects of electronic commerce do not relate particularly to goods, services, and so forth"".","WTCOMTDM31.pdf","Japan, Chairman, Japan, CTD, Members, WTO, CTD, General, Council, General, Council, Japan, Chairman, CTD, CTD, Members, Members"

It attached particular importance to the third point in paragraph 4 which related to the impact of electronic commerce on customs revenue. Argentina also had an interest in the impact of electronic commerce on other fiscal revenues, and suggested that the wording on point 3 of paragraph 4 be amended to reflect this.","WTCOMTDM31.pdf","Argentina, Argentina"
"2882",2882,"52","52.      The representative Pakistan said that his delegation needed more time to dwell on the draft report. From the outset, his delegation could go along with paragraphs 1,2,5 and 6 without changes. In connection to paragraphs 3 and 4, he referred to WT/COMTD/19, and said that any a priori exclusion of any of the points in the illustrative list for further study refered to in that document, would not be beneficial. He said that the issues raised in paragraphs 24 to 35 of the illustrative list of WT/COMTD/19 could not be taken in isolation, and it was not possible to say that discussions on these items had been exhausted. His delegation shared the view that electronic commerce had an impact on revenues other than customs revenue, and this needed to be taken into account. His delegation was of the view that the best way to proceed would be to have informal consultations on the draft report. His delegation did not wish to comment on the question of cross-cutting issues, as that was a discussion best left for the future.","WTCOMTDM31.pdf","Pakistan"
"2883",2883,"53","53.      The representative of Uruguay said his delegation was open and flexible with regard to the draft report by the Chairman to the General Council. Notwithstanding this, his delegation wished to recall that the mandate set by the General Council on 17 July established 3 points: first, that the four subsidiary bodies were to reinvigorate their work programmes in their respective areas of competence;                                                                                     WT/COMTD/M/31                                                                                            Page 11 second, the four subsidiary bodies were to identify horizontal issues, that is issues which went beyond the ambit of their own particular areas of competence, and which had a relation to various sectors and ambits of the organisation. The third point was that results of the work were to be communicated to the December General Council meeting. His delegation was of the view that the CTD needed to take into account document WT/COMTD/19, where in paragraphs 24 to 35 an illustrative list of questions was identified for further study. The range of issues identified in this document went well beyond the range of issues identified in paragraph 4 of the draft Chairman's report. He said it was one thing to identify issues for the sake of identifying them, and another for to identify issues for the sake of further study. The later aim was the intention of paragraphs 24 to 35 of Document WT/COMTD/19, and this had not yet been fulfilled. The time remaining until the December meeting of the General Council was not sufficient to exhaust the discussion of the questions identified. In this sense, his delegation was flexible as to the report that the CTD was to forward to the General Council, but was of the view that the issues identified in the CTD required in depth study, and that therefore the work of the CTD on electronic commerce needed to proceed beyond December. Regarding the mandate by the General Council to identify cross-cutting issues, his delegation was of the view that the very theme of development was a horizontal one in its relationship to electronic commerce.","WTCOMTDM31.pdf","Uruguay, Chairman, General, Council, General, Council, CTD, Chairman, General, Council, CTD, General, Council, CTD, CTD, General, Council"
"2884",2884,"54","54.      The representative of Mauritius said that his delegation could only make preliminary comments at the 31st Session. His delegation recognised the value of having the non-resident Members and Observers participate in the informal session on electronic commerce held on 25 October 2000. He said that the statements made by the USA and Japan were useful, and that the Chairman, in re-drafting the report, should make use of the creative language employed by Japan and terms such as ""e-equality"" and ""Digital Divide"". His delegation shared the view expressed by Pakistan that the CTD should not seek to pre-empt the discussion of any issue. With reference to paragraph 3, he suggested that the definition of the CTD's mandate be an inclusive one rather than an exclusive one; it was difficult to say that the CTD's work did not relate to intellectual property, goods or services. With regard to bullet 1 of paragraph 4, it was important to link the work of the WTO with that of other international organisations. Another question was how could the work of the WTO was tied up in the work of the Integrated Framework, particularly if questions related to infrastructure were to be addressed. He said that the representative of the United states had made a useful intervention relating to the role of electronic commerce in small economies, and added that since she had identified Mauritius as a small economy, this meant that she did indeed have a definition of small economies.","WTCOMTDM31.pdf","Mauritius, Members, USA, Japan, Chairman, Japan, Pakistan, CTD, CTD, CTD, WTO, WTO, Integrated, Framework, United, Mauritius"
"2885",2885,"55","55.     The Chairman clarified that it was not the intention of the report to state that the work of the CTD did not relate to goods, services, and intellectual property. The point was that the work of the CTD was cross-cutting and related to these issues and others. The point was taken that the formulation could be made in a more felicitous manner. In respect to the question of cooperation with other organisations, he noted that paragraph 6 of the report allowed for the input of other organisations.","WTCOMTDM31.pdf","Chairman, CTD, CTD"
"2886",2886,"56","56.      The representative of Bangladesh said that his delegation agreed that electronic commerce carried the potential to speed up the development of poorer countries. His delegation was therefore supportive of the work of the CTD on electronic commerce. In this context, his delegation urged that the CTD connect its work with recent initiatives undertaken by two large economies – the ""Internet for Economic Development"" of the United States and the Okinawa Initiative launched in Japan. His delegation stressed the importance of institutional coordination with these two initiatives. Referring to paragraph 6 of the draft Chairman's report, his delegation suggested that after the words ""cooperation with other agencies"" be inserted the words "" and countries, particularly the recent Japanese and US initiatives in this area"".","WTCOMTDM31.pdf","Bangladesh, CTD, CTD, United, States, Okinawa, Initiative, Japan, Chairman, US"
"2887",2887,"57","57.     The representative of India said that the briefing session of 25 October had provided a wealth of information on the economic, developmental and financial aspects of global electronic commerce. WT/COMTD/M/31 Page 12 She said that some of the suggestions for modification to the draft Chairman's report went somewhat beyond the scope of discussion held in the CTD at its 30th Session and 31st Session. Her delegation understood that reports made by the Chairman were to be of a factual nature, and that this particular report was to be on the progress made by the CTD on all aspects of the mandate. The report needed to bring out those instances when horizontal issues were discussed, and instances when - if at all - any of the substantive issues were discussed. She had attended the briefings made by the international organisations and the WTO secretariat during the informal session of the CTD of 25 October devoted to electronic commerce. She did not agree with everything that had been said on that occasion: in particular, she had heard it stated that the GATS guaranteed the right to do business electronically, that this was neither accidental nor incidental, and that this had been in the mind of some negotiators involved in the GATS. She had also heard it said that technological neutrality was fundamentally important and that this was an issue which had emerged from the work programme. She said that she had revisited the reports made by the subsidiary bodies to the General Council, and could not find any agreement by Members that these were conclusions that had been collectively reached. While she did not intend to engage into a substantive discussion on matters that were under the remit of the Council for Trade in Services, she was of the view that it was useful to report that a briefing session had been held on 25 October, and that at the 31st Session there had been no substantive discussion, as the agenda itself only provided for a consideration of the report to the General Council. She said that, in order that the report remain factual, paragraph 2 of the report which read that the ""CTD sees an interest in continued work"", should also reflect the fact that the CTD had not completed its work (as was well set out in WT/COMTD/19) that it could not take up further work on any of the issues listed for further work, and that hence it endorsed continuation of work on development-related aspects of electronic commerce. With respect to paragraph 3, she said that she agreed that the economic, financial and development needs were set out in the Global Declaration of May 1998, and that work on development related aspects of electronic commerce was of a cross-cutting nature, but that the view of her delegation was that the work of the CTD was complementary to that of the three other councils. That is, the other three councils were supposed to take into consideration the economic, financial and developmental aspects of electronic commerce in their own mandates. With respect to paragraph 4, she echoed the views expressed by other delegations that it may not be appropriate to single out three issues from the list contained in paragraphs 24 to 35 of document WT/COMTD/19. She said that instead of identifying any of the tirets, the CTD should note that an illustrative list of points which had been identified in July 1999 was not taken up in any of its areas and that it should be noted that these remained areas where further study was required. Her delegation noted that Japanese delegation had made mentioned of a number of further interesting areas for study such as the greater participation of developing countries in electronic commerce. Her delegation was of the view that the CTD should consider ways and means of enhancing the participation of developing countries in electronic commerce, and that it was necessary to ensure that the market access opportunities for developing countries were not eroded by the substitution of traditional means of conducting commerce by electronic means. She said that in respect of paragraph 6, the Global Ministerial Declaration provided for taking into account the work conducted in other organisations, and her delegation was flexible as to what could be undertaken in terms of collaboration, provided the mandate set out by the Declaration was respected. Referring to the point made by the delegation of Japan that the CTD had identified a number of issues for further work to be addressed by a horizontal task force in a non-negotiating way. She said that this was an issue in respect of which the Chairman of the General Council was holding consultations on how to proceed, and that it was not appropriate to make any substantial reference to this topic in the CTD's report.","WTCOMTDM31.pdf","India, Chairman, CTD, Chairman, CTD, WTO, CTD, GATS, General, Council, Members, Council, for, Trade, in, Services, General, Council, CTD, CTD, CTD, CTD, CTD, Japan, CTD, Chairman, General, Council, CTD"
"2888",2888,"58","58.     The representative of Canada said that over the past two years, the four subsidiary bodies concerned had conducted useful work on electronic commerce, but that further work needed to be done. He said that there was a benefit to having a broad perspective on electronic commerce. His delegation was of the view that the establishment of an ad hoc horizontal task force under the auspices of the General Council was a good way of maintaining this broad perspective. The ad hoc task force was to operate on a non-negotiating basis, was to have clear terms of reference, and its existence was                                                                                    WT/COMTD/M/31                                                                                           Page 13 to be reviewed at the next Ministerial Meeting. His delegation supported the proposal made by Japan that the CTD in its report to the General Council mention the existence of support in the CTD for the examination of cross-cutting issues through the establishment of a horizontal, non-negotiating task force. His delegation supported the reformulation suggested by the United States to paragraph 2 of the draft Chairman's report in order that it read ""without prejudice to any decision that may be taken by the General Council relating to the work programme on electronic, including its structure"". His delegation supported the Japanese proposal to replace the ""CTD's work"" with ""development related aspects"". With regard to paragraph 4, his delegation found it useful to draw on the illustrative list. Referring to comments made by Bangladesh on donor initiatives, his delegation was of the view that Canadian efforts should also be included, in particular the efforts of the Canadian Development Research Centre to provide Internet access in Asia and Africa.","WTCOMTDM31.pdf","Canada, General, Council, Japan, CTD, General, Council, CTD, United, States, Chairman, General, Council, CTD, Bangladesh, Asia, Africa"
"2889",2889,"59","59.      The representative of the European Communities said that his delegation could have lived with the report as it had been originally presented, but that since others had made comments he would do so as well. His delegation did not think it opportune to substitute the discussion held elsewhere on a horizontal task force by a new discussion on the same topic in the CTD. He noted that paragraph 4 raised a number of questions, and that issues which had been discussed went beyond what was stated in paragraph 4. It was important to concentrate on what the CTD could put forward in this discussion, and a treatment of classification and other such issues within the CTD was unlikely to be of help unless there was a clear reason to do so from a development point of view. His delegation was of the view that perhaps the formulation of paragraph 4 could be amended to convey that there was no foreclosure of a discussion on any particular issue elsewhere. He said that if a precise input was to be made by or after December, it was important to concentrate on the experience and know-how the CTD could bring to the broader discussion that was going on elsewhere, and to avoid duplication.","WTCOMTDM31.pdf","European, Communities, CTD, CTD, CTD, CTD"

However, he agreed with others that it was not the task of the CTD to prolong the discussion on how work on electronic commerce should be organised.

The Chairman recalled that, following the 30th Session of the CTD in September, an informal meeting of the CTD was organized jointly with Geneva Week to obtain briefings from various agencies to help the CTD to formulate its report to the General Council. During this informal meeting, representatives of UNCTAD, ITC, ITU, and WIPO made presentations on their work on electronic commerce and we also heard from Secretariat staff on WTO's work in this field. The CTD also had some limited time to discuss some concerns and questions raised by Members. On the basis of the discussions, the Chairman had prepared the draft report on e-commerce that was discussed at the meeting on 27 October 2000. At that meeting a number of comments were offered on the draft, and on the basis of those comments the Chairman had prepared a new draft for consideration by the WT/COMTD/M/31 Page 14 CTD. This document, which inter alia re-listed all the ""points for further study"" that were brought up in the earlier meetings of the CTD, had been distributed and was available in the room. He said he presented this report, as a Chairman's report – not necessarily as an agreed report of the CTD - to the December meeting of the General Council. The Chairman proposed that the report be discussed in informal mode. The Secretariat would, in the light of any comments, make any further adjustments that were necessary to enable the CTD to be in a position to take note of the report.","WTCOMTDM31.pdf","Chairman, CTD, CTD, Geneva, Week, CTD, General, Council, UNCTAD, ITC, ITU, WIPO, Secretariat, WTO, CTD, Members, Chairman, Chairman, CTD, CTD, Chairman, CTD, General, Council, Chairman, Secretariat, CTD"

The Chairman said that in the past he had recalled to the attention of the CTD that, normally, notifications and information provided on changes to GSP were sent to the CTD under the provisions of the Enabling Clause. Accordingly, information on any actions taken by Members under their GSP schemes in favour of LDCs were normally be provided in this way, and indeed at the last meeting, Canada had made a statement to the CTD of planned changes in their programmes to increase market access for LDCs. On the other hand, steps taken by developing countries under the 1999 Waiver on Preferential Tariff Treatment for LDCs were to be notified to the Council on Trade in Goods. The Chairman had had the opportunity to discuss the issue with the WTO Legal Affairs Division, and it seemed that the most pragmatic solution to achieve consistency in the examination process was for both the Council for Trade in Goods and this Committee to refer notifications under the Enabling Clause and the 1999 waiver to the Sub-Committee on LDCs, for substantial examination and reporting back. The Chairman indicated that he had consulted on this issue with the Chairman of the CTG who had agreed that this was a pragmatic approach that he could also propose to the CTG when it met again.","WTCOMTDM31.pdf","Chairman, CTD, GSP, CTD, Members, Canada, CTD, LDCs, LDCs, Chairman, WTO, Legal, Affairs, Division, Council, for, Trade, in, Goods, Committee, Chairman, Chairman, CTG, CTG"

She recalled that at the outset some Members had highlighted certain difficulties they would encounter with respect to the waiver because it was argued that the basis for notifications was the Enabling Clause. Others Members had argued that a waiver was necessary. She said that the Chairman now proposed that notifications be done under the Enabling Clause, and that she could not understand the rationale behind this proposal. She said that a mistake had been made to introduce a waiver and then say that notifications were to be made under the Enabling Clause. She said that if one looked to past practice, the GSP was introduced as a waiver, and was then brought under the Enabling Clause in 1979. She said her similar exercise needed to be done with the waiver for LDCs, and until such time her delegation would have certain reservations.","WTCOMTDM31.pdf","Sri, Lanka, Members, Members, Chairman, GSP"

He recalled that changes to the GSP were notified under the Enabling Clause, so that any changes in respect of LDCs would also be made under the Enabling Clause. He said that the 1999 waiver decision required that notifications were to be made to the Council for Trade in Goods, and that as a result, market access measures in respect to LDCs were notified to two different WTO bodies: those taken under the Enabling Clause went to the CTD, and those taken by developing countries under the 1999 waiver went to the CTG. The objective was to                                                                                    WT/COMTD/M/31                                                                                           Page 15 have all notifications pertaining to LDCs referred to a single body – namely the Sub-Committee on LDCs – for substantive consideration and reporting out.","WTCOMTDM31.pdf","Chairman, Sri, Lanka, GSP, Council, for, Trade, in, Goods, WTO, CTD, CTG"

She referred to the case of South Korea which had not been historically a preference giver but which could claim to be a GSP giving country. She said that there were some developing countries that gave preference coverage outside the GSP scheme, and her question was how these were to be notified. She said that when a waiver was given, the notifications made thereafter needed to be made on certain procedures. There was a legal lacuna that needed to be addressed.","WTCOMTDM31.pdf","Sri, Lanka, Chairman, GSP, GSP, South, Korea, GSP"
"2906",2906,"74","74.     The Chairman said that the legal lacuna was addressed by the 1999 waiver under which developing countries could grant tariff preferences to least-developed countries. The notification requirements under the waiver were for preferences to be notified to the CTG, while notifications under the Enabling Clause were made to the Sub-Committee. All that was being proposed was that the notifications in respect of least-developed countries under both instruments be referred to the Sub-Committee for substantive consideration. He saw that there was a need for a greater level of comfort on the part of delegations regarding the proposals, and he therefore proposed that further consultations be held on the subject.","WTCOMTDM31.pdf","Chairman, CTG"

A report by the UN Secretary-General was planned to be delivered to the Preparatory Committee by mid-January 2001. The WTO Secretariat was already involved in three of the preparatory working groups: on foreign direct investment and other private flows; trade; and systemic issues, and was contributing to inter-Secretariat work on these topics.

The reports of the inter-secretariat Working Groups, which were currently at various stages of advancement, were to feed into a report to be prepared by the Secretary-General of the UN, which was to be submitted to the Preparatory Committee in mid-January: The WTO Secretariat was involved in the preparations of the various draft reports of the inter-secretariat working groups. The PrepCom itself was expected to start work in February 2001 (dates of 13-23 February were tentatively in the calendar).

The report made only passing reference to the WTO's work on Trade and Investment and Trade and Competition. One of the 15 recommendations was relevant in this regard; the recommendation proposed that the Secretary-General convene a series of ""Global Hearings on Foreign Direct Investment"" involving business, civil society and governments, with a fact finding, rather than a prescriptive role, with an aim to discuss the pros and cons of international investment agreement and their contribution to development. Regarding the working group on ""addressing systemic issues; enhancing the coherence and consistency of the international monetary, financial and trading systems in support of development"", it had been thought that work was at an advanced stage, but that a new draft, prepared in New York, had been received which was quite radically different from anything participants in the working group had seen up to that point.","WTCOMTDM31.pdf","Director, Trade, and, Finance, Division, WTO, UNCTAD, WTO, New, York"

He said that it appeared from the presentations made that the Secretariat was not going to produce an analytical paper but was providing comments on a paper prepared by the UNCTAD, and that this was to from part of the contributions on which the Secretary-General would draw for the final report.

The question now was how the CTD was to make this substantive input into the trade chapter of the conference. His delegation was of the view that the request of the Preparatory Committee needed to be honoured, that a substantive debate needed to take place in the organisation and that the expertise of the organisation needed to be used, and that Members should not be presented with a paper that was not reflective of the variety of views within the Membership.

The representative of Egypt said that there were two issues: first, it was unclear how Members would contribute to the inter-secretariat report which was to be forwarded to the Secretary General for presentation to the UN membership.

He said that the WTO had a comparative advantage in matters of trade, and that it should bring forth its contribution regardless of the contributions made by other organisations. The WTO had all the tools in its hand to make comment on those parts of the document which were connected to WTO activities. He said that it was not clear whether by the end of December WTO Members were going to have a document, or whether Members had to await February to make comments.","WTCOMTDM31.pdf","Mexico, United, States, Norway, WTO, WTO, WTO, WTO, Members, Members"
"2925",2925,"91","91.     The Chairman said that the situation could be summed up as one in which Members clearly desired for there to be a Member-driven input to the process. He said that the original approach that had been agreed would have had the Secretariat prepare an analytical paper as a basis for discussion, and a basis on which Members could finalise their input to the Preparatory Committee. He said that this paper was not under preparation; the Secretariat had been limiting itself to comment on papers prepared elsewhere. He said that given the clear desire of members for a Member-driven approach, the approach that now needed to be taken was to invoke the original approach, namely to have an analytical document which could be used as a basis for finalising it input.

He said there were a number of documents that Members could have for that meeting: one was the inter-secretariat paper, though it remained to be seen whether the WTO Secretariat was in a position to associate themselves with the paper. The Secretariat could also make available the inputs it had itself made available for the discussions on international trade; there may be other possibilities for an analytical paper; and finally, there was the overview paper on Developments in the International Trading System which was to be discussed in the General Council.","WTCOMTDM31.pdf","Director, Development, Division, CTD, Members, Members, WTO, Secretariat, Secretariat, General, Council"

"2928",2928,"94","94.      The representative of the European Communities said that the last remarks made by the Chairman were along the right direction. He said that the principle issue here was that the CTD had a mandate from the General Council to be the focal point for discussions on Finance for Development, and it was unclear how the CTD was going to fulfil that mandate. He said that there had been an agreed line on how to proceed, and his delegation saw no reason to depart from it without knowing the reasons why and without having a better discussion on what the issue of a focal point actually meant. He said that cooperation between various secretariats seemed to be taking place, and Members needed to be informed about this. He agreed that it would be useful to hear in more detail from the Chairman as to how he thought the CTD should proceed. He said that either the CTD was serious about its mandated role from the General Council, or else – and he found this undesirable – Members would have to face the fact that there was no role for the CTD in the Financing for Development process.","WTCOMTDM31.pdf","European, Communities, Chairman, CTD, General, Council, Finance, for, Development, CTD, Members, Chairman, CTD, CTD, General, Council, Members, CTD"

The Chairman suggested that an informal meeting be held in which the CTD would look at existing documentation, as well as illustrative elements that could be part of the structure of a contribution that the CTD could make, and this would form the basis of the discussions at the 8 February meeting, which would have as its the objective to make a contribution to the meeting of the Prepcom later in February. The Chairman said that the Secretariat had given him an optimistic indication that it would be possible to have a draft paper ready in time for February on the basis of informal discussions having taken place at sometime between 8 November and 8 February.","WTCOMTDM31.pdf","Chairman, CTD, CTD, Chairman, Secretariat"

"2932",2932,"98","98.     The Chairman put forward for the consideration of the CTD a draft work programme for 2001. This was originally contained in the document Job No.6422 of 16 October 2000. The Secretariat had made a revision of this draft, with some additional items and changes in proposed dates, and this was available in the room. The programme had been drafted, following the pattern of the year 2000, with Secretariat documentation on special and differential treatment, the participation of developing countries in world trade, and technical cooperation as ""fixed"" items, together with presentations by other agencies on their technical assistance activities and a series of seminars on                                                                                     WT/COMTD/M/31                                                                                            Page 19 topics of interest to Members. Mention was made of a third Geneva Week for information purposes; although this was not technically a CTD activity, staff of the Development Division, the Technical Cooperation Division and the Secretariat Working Group on LDCs would be involved in its preparation. The timing of this event could also be subject to further discussion. The Chairman said that the distribution of the CTD's work at the various meetings took account of certain deadlines and the availability of information. There were some specific deadlines for reporting, such as the report of the JAG. On the other hand, certain papers (e.g. the ""participation"" paper) could only be prepared when data become available.","WTCOMTDM31.pdf","Chairman, CTD, Secretariat, Secretariat, Members, Development, Division, Technical, Cooperation, Division, Secretariat, Working, Group, LDCs, Chairman, CTD"
"2933",2933,"99","99.      The Chairman said that, regarding seminars, two topics had been selected on the basis of explicit proposals in the CTD. In particular, Zambia had requested a seminar on Technology Issues, and this was planned for February 2001. A seminar on e-commerce, to be held in May 2001, followed from the CTD's earlier discussion on the issue earlier, at the 30th and 31st Sessions. A third seminar, possibly linked to the Geneva Week, was proposed for September 2001 on ""Trade-Related Policies and Strategies for Development"". This would look at national and multilateral policies and strategies for development, and the interaction between the two. Some of these issues have been raised during the discussion in 2000 of the Secretariat paper on the participation of developing countries in world trade and the discussions on implementation of WTO agreements. A number of developing countries are also concerned about developing an appropriate supply response to market opportunities, and the discussion might therefore also encompass the kinds of domestic and external policies, including appropriate macro-and micro policy structures, the identification and resolution of bottlenecks, capacity-building, trade facilitation etc. needed to develop such a response. The Chairman said that in all cases, reports on the seminars by the Chairperson would be presented to the subsequent CTD meetings for formal discussion and annexed to the minutes of those meetings.","WTCOMTDM31.pdf","Chairman, CTD, Zambia, CTD, Secretariat, WTO, Chairman, Chairperson"

She said that reading the paper left one with the impression that there was no benefit stemming from GSP programmes, and that therefore more information was desirable, as this would also help donor countries to assess the effectiveness of preferences given.

He proposed that a new document be prepared which would take up some of the issues mentioned by Members. He said that the Secretariat was also required to prepare a document on the participation of developing countries in international trade, and that the issue of preferences could also be discussed in this context. He said that one operational problem was that there was a dearth of information on the structure of preferential schemes, and that what information was present was rather piecemeal. He said that the technical assistance components of special and differential treatment could be looked at in further detail. A third element was to look at proposals made in negotiating bodies such as the committee on agriculture regarding special and differential treatment.","WTCOMTDM32.pdf","Director, Development, Division, CTD, Secretariat, Members, Secretariat"

This would also allow participants to attend the General Council and the Services Council. The WTO was also looking at the possibility of the participation of ministers in Geneva Week.

"2967",2967,"117","117.     The Chairman also informed the CTD about informal consultations on possible work on small economies. The CTD had been discussing this issues on the basis of the mandate contained in paragraph 6 of the Geneva Ministerial Declaration which noted Ministers' deep concern over the marginalization of LDCs and certain small economies. So far, the work had been on the basis of submissions by Members and discussions in the CTD. At the previous meeting of the CTD, he had undertaken to hold consultations at the request of a delegation on issues relating to small economies. These consultations had been held the previous day. At the consultations there was a large measure of support for the idea that further work should be done in the CTD. It was initially proposed that this further work should undertaken by way of a work programme. Some Members could not agree with the proposal for a work programme at this time. The main concern expressed was that this would entail creation of a new category of developing countries. For their part, Members seeking further work on small economies maintained that their objective was only to identify trade-related issues that were of concern to small economies given certain special constraints that they faced. In light of this inability of some Members to support a work programme a modified proposal was made for a study by the Secretariat. While many Members were supportive of this, it was also clear that others would wish more information and greater clarity regarding the nature of the proposed study to facilitate consideration of and a decision on the matter. As a result, the Chairman therefore propose to request the Secretariat to draw up terms of reference for a possible study on trade-related constraints on small economies and that further consultations be held on the proposal for a study when the terms of reference became available. Any Member was free to submit any new documentation relating to any issue affecting small economies.

The Chairman said that at several previous sessions of the committee, he had reminded the CTD that, normally, notifications and information provided on changes to GSP were sent to the CTD under the provisions of the Enabling Clause. Accordingly, information on any actions taken by developed Members under their GSP schemes in favour of LDCs would normally be provided in that way, and indeed at the previous meeting the EC and Canada had notified the CTD of planned changes in their programmes to increase market access for LDCs. On the other hand, steps taken by developing countries under the 1999 Waiver on Preferential Tariff Treatment for LDCs were to be notified to the Council on Trade in Goods. As he had said previously, there was an inconsistency in the reporting procedures. In order to resolve that, he had proposed in his fax of 27 November 2000 that any market access measures taken specifically in favour of the least-developed countries, whether under the Enabling Clause and notified to the CTD or under the 1999 waiver and notified to the CTG be transmitted by either body, to the Sub-Committee on LDCs, for substantive consideration. The Sub-Committee would report back to the CTD or CTG, as appropriate, on its discussions. The objective was to allow for a unified consideration in one forum, i.e. the Sub-Committee on Least-Developed Countries, of measures taken in favour of the LDCs. No modification to existing notification procedures was proposed. As Members would recall, he had consulted with the Chairman of the CTG about it who had agreed that it was a pragmatic approach that he could propose to the CTG. Unfortunately, the CTG had not met and he would continue to pursue the matter and monitor CTG action. In the meantime, he proposed that the CTD take a decision on the matter and he put it before the Committee for its consideration. He asked Members whether the proposal was acceptable to the Committee.","WTCOMTDM32.pdf","Chairman, CTD, GSP, CTD, Members, EC, Canada, CTD, LDCs, LDCs, CTD, CTG, Sub-Committee, CTD, CTG, Members, Chairman, CTG, CTG, CTG, CTG, CTD, Committee, Members, Committee"

The representative of the United States said that her delegation probably would be prepared to agree to such a procedure ad referendum as she wished to see what happened in the CTG. She asked if the notifications were to be transmitted to the Sub-Committee on Least-Developed Countries, and whether that meant that notifications originally made in the CTD and the CTG would continue to be made in the two bodies so that the practice of notifying the CTD and the CTG of measures by developed and developing respectively would be continued. Her understanding was that the decision would be to transmit those notifications to the Sub-Committee on Least-Developed Countries for substantive discussion and reporting back while the notifications themselves would continue to be made according to existing practice.","WTCOMTDM32.pdf","United, States, CTG, Least-Developed, Countries, CTD, CTG, CTD, CTG"

"2975",2975,"124","124.

The Chairman said that it was his understanding that there had been consultations and that Ambassador Nathan Irumba of Uganda had been nominated as Chairman for the year ahead. He noted that Ambassador Irumba had been a keen follower and participant in the work of the CTD. He had served as Ambassador to the UN in New York and in a number of positions in Uganda, London and Paris. There was no doubt about his experience and qualifications and his capacity to lead the CTD. He asked if the CTD approved the election of Ambassador Irumba. It was so agreed.","WTCOMTDM32.pdf","Chairman, Ambassador, Nathan, Irumba, Uganda, Chairman, Ambassador, Irumba, CTD, Ambassador, UN, New, York, Uganda, London, Paris, CTD, Ambassador, Irumba"

"2983",2983,"131","131.    The Chairman said that there were two matters to raise under other business. The first was a request for any inputs to the preparation for the CTD seminar on electronic commerce planned for May 2001. The second was an announcement about plans for an internship scheme for missions in Geneva. Copies of the plan were available in the Room.","WTCOMTDM32.pdf","Chairman, CTD, Geneva"
"2984",2984,"132","132.     The Director of the Development Division recalled his earlier statement on e-commerce and repeated his request for ideas for topics and the names of experts to speak at the seminar. He also introduced the internship scheme for young people from selected countries to permit them to enhance their knowledge of the multilateral trading system and support their mission in participating more actively in the daily activities of the WTO. The selected candidates would ideal be involved in trade policy matters either at home or in Geneva. The programme would be different from other such internship programmes in that the candidates would work within their national missions in Geneva, not in the WTO Secretariat. Assignments would be of 10-12 months duration. They would be able to participate in seminars organised by the Secretariat. The selection of candidates would be made jointly by the WTO Secretariat and the mission in question. More information could be obtained from the WTO Human Resources Section.","WTCOMTDM32.pdf","Director, Development, Division, WTO, Geneva, Geneva, WTO, Secretariat, Secretariat, WTO, Secretariat, WTO, Human, Resources, Section"

This was an interesting initiative and without making any commitment he was confident that WT/COMTD/M/32 Page 26 Switzerland would look favourably on any financing request for such an internship on condition that the issue fitted within the WTO technical assistance strategy.

"2988",2988,"136","136.     The representative of Egypt thanked the Secretariat for the initiative. He supported Sri Lanka on selection criteria, in particular in relation to giving priority to the needs of small delegations. In relation to Sri Lanka's point about choosing persons with some prior knowledge of the WTO, there could be a link with the three-month course for which there was a register of participants. This could be factored in as a criterion.","WTCOMTDM32.pdf","Egypt, Secretariat, Sri, Lanka, Sri, Lanka, WTO"
"2989",2989,"137","137.     The representative of St Lucia thanked Canada for raising the question of non-residents and how interns from such countries could be placed, as she had the same question. Regarding Egypt's point, she noted that, while participants in previous training courses had some prior knowledge of the WTO, there were also other ways and there should not be an absolute linkage to the three-month course.","WTCOMTDM32.pdf","St, Lucia, Canada, Egypt, WTO"
"2990",2990,"138","138.    The representative of Cuba thanked the Secretariat for the initiative which could contribute to improving the training of young officials from developing countries, enabling them to take knowledge back to capitals and enrich the missions here in Geneva. Cuba also agreed with Sri Lanka that priority should be given to small delegations based in Geneva and also supported Egypt on the selection of participants from the three-month courses.","WTCOMTDM32.pdf","Cuba, Secretariat, Geneva, Cuba, Sri, Lanka, Geneva, Egypt"
"2991",2991,"139","139.     The Head of the Human Resources Section was encouraged by the responses from the delegations. The point about the needs of small delegations would be taken into account in establishing the list of interns. A prior knowledge of the WTO would also be in the interest of all parties concerned, and he noted the comment that there should not necessarily be a link to the three-month courses. Coordination was being done by the Human Resources Section and questions could be addressed to him or the relevant colleague.","WTCOMTDM32.pdf","Head, WTO, Human, Resources, Section"

"2998",2998,"145","145.     The Chairman said it had been a satisfying experience to preside over meetings of the CTD in the previous year. This had been a year of quite intensive activity and the CTD had made progress in clarifying and sharpening the views of participants in an number of important areas: special and differential treatment, technical cooperation, implementation, on the participation of developing countries in world trade, on trade and technology, on the question even of small economies and many                                                                                    WT/COMTD/M/32                                                                                           Page 27 others. As in the WTO as a whole, one could not avoid a sense of regret that the CTD seemed to move a bit too slowly from consideration of issues to considered action on issues. At the same time, he recognised the importance of hearing all voices and abiding by the principles of transparency and consensus in the work. He was gratified that the CTD had continued to uphold these principles in the past year. The year had seen the announcement of measures or actions implementing improved market access through the GSP schemes in favour of the developing countries and in a number of cases in favour of least-developed countries. Some of these measures had also been implemented by developing countries. There were many challenges ahead for the CTD, and the proposed work programme for 2001 held the promise of an interesting and rewarding year to come. He had no doubt that under the able guidance of his successor, Ambassador Irumba, this would be realised. He wished to thank all participants in the work of the CTD for the cooperative spirit they had shown over the year. This had made his task easier. He was aware that, if at times it had seemed a little less easy, he knew that it was as easy as instructions had permitted. He also expressed his appreciation to the Secretariat, including interpreters. It was gratifying to find that on so many occasions the CTD had moved closer to a common understanding this year including on one of particular interest to his own delegation and he remained optimistic regarding an eventual outcome on all these issues.","WTCOMTDM32.pdf","Chairman, CTD, CTD, WTO, CTD, CTD, GSP, CTD, Ambassador, Irumba, CTD, Secretariat, CTD"
